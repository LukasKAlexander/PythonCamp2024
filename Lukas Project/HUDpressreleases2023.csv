"Friday, December 22, 2023",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_286,HUD and Census Bureau Report New Residential Sales in November 2023,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Census Bureau jointly announced the following new residential sales statistics for November 2023: New Home Sales Sales of new single‐family houses in November 2023 were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 590,000, according to estimates released jointly today by the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. This is 12.2 percent (±15.6 percent)* below the revised October rate of 672,000, but is 1.4 percent (±19.8 percent)* above the November 2022 estimate of 582,000. Sales Price The median sales price of new houses sold in November 2023 was $434,700. The average sales price was $488,900. For Sale Inventory and Months’ Supply The seasonally‐adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of November was 451,000. This represents a supply of 9.2 months at the current sales rate. The December report is scheduled for release on January 25, 2024 View the full schedule in the Economic Briefing Room: www.census.gov/economic‐indicators/. The full text and tables for this release can be found at www.census.gov/construction/nrs/ EXPLANATORY NOTES These statistics are estimated from sample surveys. They are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated average relative standard errors of the preliminary data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as “2.5 percent (±3.2%) above” appears in the text, this indicates the range (‐0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90‐percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. Changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show irregular movement. It takes 3 months to establish a trend for new houses sold. Preliminary new home sales figures are subject to revision due to the survey methodology and definitions used. The survey is primarily based on a sample of houses selected from building permits. Since a “sale” is defined as a deposit taken or sales agreement signed, this can occur prior to a permit being issued. An estimate of these prior sales is included in the sales figure. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimate of total sales is revised about 3.4 percent. Changes in sales price data reflect changes in the distribution of houses by region, size, etc., as well as changes in the prices of houses with identical characteristics. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at the Census Bureau’s website. * The 90 percent confidence interval includes zero. In such cases, there is insufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Thursday, December 21, 2023",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_284,Biden-Harris Administration Announces $174 Million to Support Energy Efficiency and Climate Resilience for Thousands of Low-Income Households as Part of Investing in America Agenda,"WASHINGTON – As part of President Biden’s Investing in America agenda, a key pillar of Bidenomics, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced it is awarding $173.9 million in new loans and grants under the Green and Resilient Retrofit Program’s (GRRP) Comprehensive and Elements categories. The awards announced today will support energy efficiency, electrification, clean energy, low embodied carbon materials, and climate resilience improvements in 30 HUD-assisted multifamily properties that include 3,070 rental homes for low-income individuals and families. These investments will help tackle the climate crisis and support equitable economic development in American communities as part of President Biden’s Investing in America agenda and historic environmental justice agenda. GRRP grant and loan funding announced today will improve the quality of life for residents by expanding energy efficiency, reducing climate pollution, generating renewable energy, promoting the use of green building materials, improving indoor air quality, and enhancing climate resilience. “Thanks to President Biden’s Investing in America agenda, we are boosting energy efficiency and combatting climate change in communities across the country,” said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “I am deeply proud of our HUD team for getting hundreds of millions of dollars from the President’s Inflation Reduction Act on the street through the Green and Resilient Retrofit Program. Together, we are directing these funds to the people we serve, and ensuring thousands of American families can live in more resilient, efficient, and affordable communities.” Today’s announcement includes the first set of awards made under the GRRP’s Comprehensive category, which provides funding to properties with the highest need for climate resilience and energy efficiency upgrades. Prior energy saving retrofit and green building experience is not needed with scopes of work developed in partnership with a HUD-provided contractor, ensuring access to all owners of eligible HUD-properties. Among the 19 properties receiving Comprehensive awards, five have fewer than 50 units, seven have between 50 and 100 units, and all serve low-income residents and roughly half serve seniors. Sixteen of the properties face notable risk from climate and natural hazards such as flooding, heat waves, earthquakes, tornados, lightning, hail, severe winter weather and ice storms. “Far too many Americans struggle to stay warm in the winter and cool in the summer,” said John Podesta, Senior Advisor to the President for Clean Energy Innovation and Implementation. “Today’s awards from the Department of Housing and Urban Development will boost the quality of life for thousands of moderate- and low-income American families by making their homes safer and more comfortable.” The announcement also includes 11 awards under the GRRP’s Elements category. This is the second set of awards for this category, which provides funding for property owners to include climate resilience and energy and water efficiency improvements as part of a development or rehabilitation transaction that was already underway. “As we look back on the climate- and weather-related disasters of the past few years, we see vividly how vital this funding is to ensure the long-term safety and viability of households and communities,” said Assistant Secretary for Housing and Federal Housing Commissioner Julia Gordon. “Awards through the GRRP program illustrate the immediate and concrete steps that the Biden-Harris Administration is taking to protect the nation’s low-income residents and the environment.” President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act—the largest climate investment in history—established the GRRP, providing more than $800 million in grant funding and $4 billion in loan commitment authority. Investments under the GRRP will advance environmental justice by serving low-income families as part of President Biden’s Justice40 Initiative, which aims to deliver 40 percent of the overall benefits of certain federal investments to disadvantaged communities marginalized by underinvestment and overburdened by pollution. Retrofitting these homes will make them more resilient to extreme weather events that are becoming more frequent due to climate change and enhance the ability of residents and owners to better cope with and recover from such events.

Investments under the program will be made in affordable housing communities serving low-income families under Bidenomics—President Biden’s agenda for building the American economy from the middle out and the bottom up. The GRRP Notices of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) and additional guidance detail the multiple funding options for which property owners may apply: Elements provides funding to owners for proven and meaningful climate resilience and utility efficiency measures in projects that are already in the process of being recapitalized. Leading Edge provides funding to owners with plans for ambitious retrofit activities to achieve zero energy retrofits and an advanced green certification. Comprehensive provides funding to properties with the highest need for climate resilience and utility efficiency upgrades, regardless of prior development or environmental retrofit experience. Property owners are encouraged to continue to submit applications for grant awards or loans in any of the three categories. HUD is reviewing applications under one category each month for the duration of funding availability. HUD expects to announce awards regularly throughout 2024. The Inflation Reduction Act also established HUD’s Energy and Water Benchmarking Service, available now for properties receiving rental assistance from its Multifamily project-based programs. This new, free service provides participating multifamily property owners with data on energy and water consumption at their properties to aid in identifying opportunities to improve efficiency. Property owners can also use the Energy and Water Benchmarking information to assess rehabilitation efforts that may be eligible for grant or loan funding under the GRRP or other sources of funding. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Wednesday, December 20, 2023",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_283,HUD Closes 2023 with Historic Investments in Housing,"WASHINGTON - When this Administration began, conditions were bleak. Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, millions of Americans could not access quality, safe, and affordable housing options. Three years later, under the leadership of Secretary Marcia L. Fudge, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has made historic strides to provide direct housing assistance, expand opportunities for homeownership and affordable rental housing, build climate-resilient communities, and root out discrimination in housing. Specifically: HUD has housed people through 120,000 new incremental vouchers in a three-year period, a 20-year record. The Federal Housing Administration has cut costs for homeowners and brought first-time homebuyers into the fold, achieving the first-time homebuyer rate at the highest it has been in over two decades. HUD has addressed the legacies of racial discrimination in housing. New investments will build for the future, ensuring communities are resilient to the effects of the climate crisis, particularly for Black, Indigenous, and low-income residents of color, which are often hit the hardest. Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae) supported a record high of over $2.5 trillion in current government lending, by providing liquidity in the housing finance system and facilitating the flow of more investment capital into US housing markets. “I could not be prouder to serve an Administration and a Department that is expanding access to affordable housing like never before,” said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “In the midst of a tough housing market, the need has never been greater for our assistance. But we are working to meet the challenge. From broadening homeownership opportunities for first-time homebuyers, to taking on discrimination in housing, we are making a real impact on those we serve.” See HUD’s funding impact across the U.S.: Significant Levels of Rental Assistance: HUD has awarded roughly 120,000 new incremental housing vouchers – a milestone number – including new Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (VASH), Family Unification Program/Foster Youth to Independence (FUP/FYI), Mainstream, Stability Vouchers, Emergency Housing Vouchers (EHV), and flexible Housing Choice Vouchers. HUD helped launch the White House Blueprint for a Renters Bill of Rights. Based on initiatives in the blueprint, HUD announced $10 million for tenant education and outreach. In a brand-new effort to curb evictions, the Department also announced a proposed rule to require public housing agencies (PHA) with tenants in public housing and owners of properties participating in HUD Multifamily project-based rental assistance programs to provide their tenants with written notification at least 30 days prior to filing for an eviction due to nonpayment of rent. Funded legal assistance to over 19,000 low-income tenant households at risk of, or subject to, eviction by doubling funding for the Eviction Protection Grant program – a first of its kind program funded in 2022. Tribal housing has received milestone increases in funding. This includes investing more than $1 billion for housing in Tribal communities through the Indian Housing Block Grant (IHBG) Formula program, the IHBG Competitive program, the Indian Community Development Block Grant program, and the Native Hawaiian Housing Block Grant program.

High Rate of First-Time Homebuyers: FHA’s first-time homebuyer rate under the Biden-Harris Administration is the highest it has been since at least 2000. Since the start of the Administration, FHA has supported nearly 1.8 million homeowners with purchase mortgages, and 83.6 percent or 1.5 million of whom are first-time homebuyers. This past year alone, more than four out of every five borrowers with FHA-insured mortgages are first-time homebuyers, while in the market as a whole, fewer than half of mortgages are made to first-time homebuyers. Ginnie Mae’s portfolio supports first-time homebuyers across government lending programs, supporting financing for 2.2 million first-time home buyers from FHA, VA, USDA, and PIH since the start of the Administration.

Noteworthy Policies to Root Out Discrimination in Housing: HUD is working on a final rule regarding Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing (AFFH) rule, meaningfully implementing the Fair Housing Act to address significant disparities in housing needs for members of protected classes. HUD also restored the Discriminatory Effects Rule, a vital tool to protect fair housing and address policies that unnecessarily cause systemic inequality in housing, regardless of whether they were adopted with discriminatory intent. To support second chances and successful reentry for people leaving incarceration, HUD plans to issue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that will require providers of HUD-assisted housing to use an individualized approach to screening, admissions, and other housing decisions.

First-Ever Actions to Address Climate Effects: HUD is innovating in how it approaches climate investment, creating the first-ever HUD program to simultaneously invest in energy efficiency, renewable energy generation, climate resilience and low embodied carbon. Funded through President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the Green and Resilient Retrofit Program (GRRP) provides $800 million in grant and loan subsidy funding and $4 billion in loan commitment to HUD-Assisted Multifamily Housing to make homes safer and more sustainable. Recognizing the tremendous opportunities for investments across federal agencies HUD launched a web-based Funding Navigator and supporting resources to connect program participants to funding opportunities for climate resilience, energy efficiency, renewable energy integration, healthy housing, workforce development and environmental justice. HUD provided $6.7 billion in disaster assistance through Community Development Block Grant-Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) to help communities build back resiliently following disasters in 2021 and 2022. To better serve communities who face direct impacts of weather-related disasters, HUD established a new Office of Disaster Management (ODM) in the Office of the Deputy Secretary and a new Office of Disaster Recovery (ODR) in the Office of Community Planning and Development.

"Tuesday, December 19, 2023",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_281,HUD Awards $10 Million to Help Vulnerable Families and Youth in Foster Care at Risk of Homelessness,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) awarded today $10 million for over 600 vouchers to 13 public housing authorities nationwide, to identify youth with a history of foster care involvement who are homeless or at risk of homelessness and families whose lack of adequate housing is the primary reason their children are in foster care. This funding, offered through HUD's Family Unification Program (FUP) will provide 625 Family Unification Program (FUP) vouchers to youth and families to find housing and will help strengthen coordination among public housing authorities (PHAs), public child welfare agencies (PCWAs), and Continuums of Care (CoCs) and increase access to supportive services for those who need them. See listing of agencies below who have received funding below. “Keeping youth and families off the streets is essential to our efforts to reduce and ultimately end homelessness,” said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “This funding will help our local partners aid youth and allow families to get into more permanent and stable housing. HUD is committed to ending homelessness, and this funding and partnership help us continue that critical part of our mission.” As part of FUP, PHAs that partner with PCWAs and CoCs offer Housing Choice Vouchers (HCVs) to two groups: Families for whom the lack of adequate housing is a primary factor in the imminent placement of the family's child, or children, in out-of-home care; or the delay in the discharge of the child, or children, to the family from out-of-home care; and Youth aged 18 to 24, who have either exited foster care or will do so within the next 90 days, and meet the criteria outlined in Section 475(5)(H) of the Social Security Act, are eligible if they are homeless or at risk of homelessness and are 16 years or older. PHAs administer the FUP in partnership with PCWAs, which are responsible for referring FUP families and youths to the PHA for the determination of eligibility for rental assistance. After the PCWA makes the referral, the PHA places the FUP applicant on its waiting list, assesses whether the family or youth meets HCV program eligibility requirements, and manages all other processes related to voucher issuance and administration. There is no time limit on FUP vouchers issued to families. FUP vouchers issued to youth are limited to 36 months unless the youth meets the requirements to receive an extension of their voucher assistance under the Fostering Stable Housing Opportunities (FSHO) amendments. Under FSHO, FUP youth may receive an additional 24 months of voucher assistance if they meet certain requirements. In addition to rental assistance, FUP youths must receive supportive services for 36 months. Examples of the skills targeted by these services include money management, job preparation, educational counseling, and proper nutrition and meal preparation. PHA Name Vouchers Award Funding 1.

"Monday, December 18, 2023",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_280,"HUD Charges Hawaii Condominium Association, Management Company, Condominium Unit Owners, and Real Estate Agent with Disability Discrimination","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is charging individuals and entities associated with a Kailua-Kona, Hawaii, condominium complex, including the condominium association, employees of the condominium association, the property management company, an employee of the property management company, the condominium unit’s owners, and the owners’ real estate broker with discriminating against a resident because of disability. Read HUD’s Charge. The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination because of disability, including refusing to allow reasonable accommodations or modifications that would otherwise permit homeowners with disabilities an equal opportunity to use and enjoy their housing. ""The Fair Housing Act requires housing providers to permit reasonable accommodations when such accommodation is necessary for an individual with disabilities to have equal enjoyment of housing,” said Demetria L. McCain, HUD Principal Assistant Deputy Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. “Today's action demonstrates HUD’s ongoing dedication to taking appropriate action when housing providers fail to comply with the Fair Housing Act.” “Today’s action should remind housing providers of their obligation to ensure that residents with disabilities have access to their residences and to accessible parking spaces,” said HUD General Counsel Damon Smith. “HUD is committed to vigorously enforcing the Act to protect individuals' rights."" HUD’s Charge of Discrimination alleges that the property’s condominium association and its employees, the property’s management company and its employees, and the condominium unit’s owners and their real estate agent, prevented the resident from using a temporary ramp to safely access his unit, from accessing a parking space that would allow him to load and unload his wheelchair, and from replacing a toilet at the resident’s own expense to allow him full use of his unit. Because they failed to do so, the resident was often unable to access or use his unit and forced to sleep in his vehicle. Ultimately, their actions resulted in the resident’s decision to revoke his offer to purchase the unit and move out of the unit, which he was renting while the sale was in escrow. A United States Administrative Law Judge will hear HUD’s charge unless any party elects to have the case heard in Federal district court. If the Administrative Law Judge finds, after a hearing, that discrimination has occurred, the judge may award damages to the resident for his losses as a result of the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief to deter further discrimination, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties to vindicate the public interest. If the Federal court hears the case, the Judge may also award punitive damages to the resident.

"Friday, December 15, 2023",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_278,HUD Releases January 2023 Point-in-Time Count Report,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today released its 2023 Annual Homeless Assessment Report: Part 1: Point-in-Time Estimates, an annual snapshot of the number of individuals in shelters, temporary housing, and in unsheltered settings. The report found more than 650,000 people were experiencing homelessness on a single night in January 2023, a 12% increase from 2022. The report also includes the Housing Inventory Count of shelter and housing resources to serve people experiencing homelessness. The rise in homelessness at the beginning of 2023 continued a pre-pandemic trend from 2016 to 2020, when homelessness also increased. President Biden’s American Rescue Plan (ARP) – the largest single-year investment in preventing and ending homelessness in U.S. history – prevented a rise in homelessness between 2020 and 2022. Many of these ARP resources have now expired or wound down, which has contributed to the increase in homelessness. In the nearly one year since the 2023 PIT Count was conducted, the Biden-Harris Administration has taken sweeping new steps that are yielding results: through implementation of the Housing Supply Action Plan, more apartments are on track to be built this year than any year on record; this week, HUD announced that it has helped more than 424,000 households connect to homeless support services, exit homelessness, or avoid homelessness altogether in 2023; and earlier this month, VA announced that it has housed more than 38,000 homeless veterans-meeting its goal for 2023 two months early. “Homelessness is solvable and should not exist in the United States,” said Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “From day one, this Administration has put forth a comprehensive plan to tackle homelessness and we’ve acted aggressively and in conjunction with our federal, state, and local partners to address this challenge. We’ve made positive strides, but there is still more work to be done. This data underscores the urgent need for support for proven solutions and strategies that help people quickly exit homelessness and that prevent homelessness in the first place.” HUD data indicates that the rise in overall homelessness is largely due to a sharp rise in the number of people who became homeless for the first time. Between federal fiscal years 2021 and 2022, the number of people who became newly homeless increased by 25%, even as the number of people who exited homelessness to permanent housing increased by 8%. This rise in first-time homelessness is likely attributable to a combination of factors, including but not limited to, the recent changes in the rental housing market and the winding down of pandemic protections and programs focused on preventing evictions and housing loss. Most notably, rental housing conditions were extraordinarily challenging in the year preceding the January 2023 PIT count. This rate of rent growth has now moderated thanks to housing under construction becoming available to rent in the coming year, but the supply shortage of 2022 likely contributed to this increase in rents and homelessness in 2022. Since Day One, the Biden-Harris Administration has been tackling the nation’s homelessness crisis with the urgency it requires, prioritizing new resources and programs to help communities quickly reconnect people experiencing homelessness to housing. The Biden-Harris Administration’s pandemic-era protections and programs such as the scaling of additional Emergency Rental Assistance, and implementation of the enhanced Child Tax Credit and Earned Income Tax Credit prevented evictions and helped to prevent a spike in homelessness in 2021 even amidst worsening housing needs. The Administration has partnered with state and local leaders across the country to support their efforts. Today the Biden-Harris Administration is releasing fact sheets showing how each state has benefitted from historic investments across key programs. These investments are in addition to sweeping new efforts across the Administration to increase housing supply, lower costs, and protect renters, including through the first-ever Housing Supply Action Plan and Blueprint for a Renters Bill of Rights. The Biden-Harris Administration continues its efforts to not only stop but reverse the post-2016 trend of rising homelessness, as stated in All In, The Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness, which the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH) released in December 2022. President Biden’s FY2024 Budget calls for Congress to make commonsense investments to lower rental costs and address homelessness, including guaranteed vouchers for low-income veterans and youth aging out of foster care-two groups at higher risk of homelessness. HUD has substantially invested in addressing the housing needs of those facing homelessness, particularly the most vulnerable populations – see a summary of these actions here.

"Friday, December 15, 2023",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_277,HUD Announces $40 Million Funding Opportunity to Expand Support Services for Seniors and Persons with Disabilities,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) Office of Multifamily Housing Programs announced today that $40 million in funding is available to expand the supply of service coordinators who support seniors and persons with disabilities living in affordable multifamily homes. “It’s crucial that HUD not only provides funds to support our seniors, but the resources to ensure that these funds are implemented,” said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “Our service coordinators play such an important role in bringing supportive services so seniors and those with disabilities can live with stability.” Offered through the Service Coordinator in Multifamily Housing (SCMF) program, HUD intends to provide approximately 160 grant awards to pay salaries and associated benefits for these social service professionals. Service coordinators play a critical role in connecting residents and their families with resources that enable them to thrive in their communities and age in place. These resources include access to financial management assistance, opportunities for social connections, and health and well-being programs. “We’re excited to announce the availability of this vital funding opportunity,” said Assistant Secretary for Housing and Federal Housing Commissioner Julia Gordon. “Linking disabled persons and seniors with supportive services promotes independence and dignity.” “These awards help bring stability and support directly to seniors and persons with disabilities to address immediate needs and help prevent more serious urgent care events in the future,” said Deputy Assistant Secretary for Multifamily Housing Programs Ethan Handelman. Applicants can find full details about the submission requirements and process in the NOFO published today on grants.gov.

"Wednesday, December 13, 2023",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_279,HUD Announces Customer Experience Improvements Two Years Following President Biden’s Executive Order,"WASHINGTON - Deputy Secretary Adrianne Todman announced significant improvements in customer experience implemented in the second year since President Biden’s signed the Executive Order, “Transforming Federal Customer Experience and Service Delivery to Rebuild Trust in Government.” This directive urged agencies to enhance the overall experience for individuals accessing government services and benefits. In alignment with HUD’s commitment to create strong, sustainable, and inclusive communities, as well as providing quality affordable homes for all, the Department has taken steps to keep the lived-experience of its public customers at the heart of everything the Department does to fulfil its mission. By gaining a deeper understanding of the needs of these end customers, HUD is actively developing innovative solutions aimed at revolutionizing customer interactions with the Department and its partners. This strategic approach underscores HUD's dedication to continually elevate and transform the customer experience landscape. “The Biden-Harris Administration has prioritized improving customer experience (CX) to ensure all Americans who access federal government resources are served,” said Deputy Secretary Adrianne Todman. “I am committed to ensuring that the foundation of HUD’s future is people first.” Over the past year: HUD's CX team conducted customer research across programs, focusing on our customers’ experience in disaster recovery, filing housing discrimination complaints, and finding and applying for affordable housing. They've reached out and listened directly to the public to understand the lived experience of our customers and partners and helped prioritize opportunities for HUD to improve their experience and further HUD’s mission. HUD’s CX team, the Office of Disaster Recovery, and the Office of Public Affairs/Web Team worked together to help disaster survivors access critical government resources through HUD.gov. The teams conducted customer research to understand survivors' needs and challenges, then they translated these insights into a website design for disaster survivors to easily access the federal resources they need most. HUD published the Housing Opportunity Through Modernization ACT (HOTMA) Rule in February 2023, which provides several burden reductions for tenants. These reductions update methods for calculating family income, assets, and simplify financial records review. The rule streamlines application and admission to HUD programs, making it significantly easier for customers to access these resources. HUD launched a digital self-service portal for FHA-backed lenders. The digital self-service portal allows lenders to streamline the process by uploading all documents directly to the portal. This eliminates wait times of up to 24 hours to review documents. The portal is estimated to save 654,000 hours of wait time. The portal will accelerate the path to homeownership for FHA loan applicants. HUD developed a detailed plan focusing on specialized, trauma-informed support for staff who handle housing discrimination cases, including cases involving survivors of sexual assault. This plan will ensure thousands of complainants feel empowered and supported throughout the discrimination complaint process. HUD continues to prioritize CX so that all interactions with HUD feel easy, effective, positive, and equitable. With CX, HUD can better deliver on its mission, serve vulnerable populations more effectively and equitably, build customer trust and satisfaction, and more. Through additional customer research and design, HUD will empower employees to deliver exceptional products and services to the American public. As this work continues, updates will be posted on https://performance.gov/cx. Most recently, High Impact Service Providers shared their 2023 Customer Experience Action Plans, and all agencies shared a point-by-point progress update on each of the CX Executive Order’s agency commitments.

"Wednesday, December 13, 2023",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_276,"In 2023, HUD Helps More Than 424,000 Households Connect to Homeless Support Services, Exit or Avoid Homelessness","WASHINGTON - From January 2023 through December 2023, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is projected to serve 330,000 people through grants provided to homeless service organizations (Continuums of Care), an increase of 15% over grants funded in 2022. In addition, HUD has worked with Public Housing Authorities across the country to help more than 94,000 households exit or avoid homelessness in 2023, including more than 8,200 households through public housing, more than 56,900 through incremental Housing Choice Vouchers, and more than 28,200 households experiencing or at-risk of homelessness through the Emergency Housing Voucher program. This latest data builds on bold and innovative actions by the Biden-Harris administration to address the homelessness challenge head on. “President Biden and Vice President Harris believe that homelessness is solvable and should not exist in the United States. HUD and our community partners have acted aggressively to end homelessness by working with communities to get people into housing and provide the resources necessary to help prevent people from ever becoming homeless,” said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “We believe one person experiencing homelessness is too many. That is why HUD and all of our partners across the Administration are doing all we can to address homelessness with resolve and care."" This progress in 2023 builds on strides HUD has made to permanently house people experiencing homelessness. The number of people who exited homelessness into permanent housing increased from 278,209 people in federal fiscal year 2021 to 299,580 people in federal fiscal year 2022-an 8% year over year increase, according to homelessness system performance measures reported to HUD from Continuums of Care. From Day One of the Administration, the President has made tackling homelessness a top priority. His American Rescue Plan made the largest single-year investment in ending homelessness in U.S. history. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has taken up the charge to help communities assist more people experiencing homelessness to obtain a stable home across America. A key part of HUD’s efforts has been to enlist and support the more than 3,000 public housing agencies (PHAs) who administer public housing and housing vouchers to play greater roles in assisting people experiencing homelessness. Data collected by HUD shows that these efforts are working. In November 2023, the Department of Veterans Affairs announced that it has permanently housed 38,847 homeless Veterans through October of 2023 - surpassing the calendar year goal to house 38,000 Veterans two months early. During this time period, PHAs administering Emergency Housing Vouchers placed nearly 28,200 households into homes, with the majority of household served being people experiencing homelessness. HUD required the approximately 600 administering PHAs to enter into formal partnerships with local Continuums of Care (CoCs) and victim services providers to target vouchers and provided technical assistance to support these partnerships. In addition, HUD provided PHAs and their partners with additional administrative and services fees along with greater regulatory flexibilities such as allowing people to be issued vouchers and obtain housing while paperwork and documentation are in the process of being provided. “Emergency Housing Vouchers have been a powerful force for addressing homelessness in communities across the country,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing Richard J. Monocchio. “The partnerships between housing authorities and Continuums of Care, the extra support for residents’ housing searches, landlords working with tenants to lease up quickly, and other flexibilities have demonstrated the power of creating programs that can meet urgent, local needs at a time of crisis.” During 2023, HUD provided additional resources, guidance, and support to PHAs to encourage them to support efforts to address homelessness. In April 2023, HUD also coordinated an allocation of approximately 3,300 Stability Vouchers to PHAs who are formally partnering with CoCs who received $486 million in grants to address unsheltered and/or rural homelessness. In June 2023, HUD issued updated guidance to PHAs on how they can further assist in efforts to address homelessness through their public housing and incremental Housing Choice Vouchers, both of which can serve, but are not exclusively targeted to people experiencing homelessness. In November 2023, HUD’s Office of Public and Indian Housing issued a letter further highlighting all of these resources and flexibilities available to PHAs to help them address homelessness, including the opportunity to seek waivers and alternative requirements. Complete data on people exiting homelessness into permanent housing through all modes will be available in early 2024. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Monday, December 11, 2023",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_275,"HUD Announces Settlement Agreement Requiring Oklahoma Housing Provider Pay $300,000 to Victims of Housing Discrimination","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has entered into a Voluntary Compliance Agreement-Conciliation Agreement (VCA-CA) with Cushing Housing Inc. requiring respondents to pay $300,000 to individuals, including former tenants, that were subjected to housing discrimination at Cushing’s property. Read the agreement. “Under the Biden-Harris Administration, we are taking on housing discrimination like never before,” said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “HUD is holding people accountable, and ensuring those who face discrimination have a voice to build a fairer nation for all.” The agreement stems from a complaint filed by tenants alleging Cushing Housing violated civil rights laws when it failed to address serious, racially motivated harassment that denied them the ability to peacefully enjoy their housing. The harassment was so severe that it left them fearful of leaving their apartment and took a substantial toll on their mental health. The VCA-CA resolves HUD’s October 26, 2022 Letter of Findings which found respondents discriminated against the tenants in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Title VI prohibits discrimination based on race by recipients of federal financial assistance, including where a recipient fails to adequately respond to known racial harassment against a beneficiary of its program. Title VI also prohibits retaliating against a person engaged in a protected activity, such as where they seek to have the housing provider address such racial harassment. Cushing Housing is required to comply with Title VI because they are a recipient of Federal financial assistance from HUD. “No tenant should be subjected to harassment and subsequent retaliation by a HUD funded housing provider” said Demetria L. McCain, HUD’s Principal Deputy Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. “This agreement and the previously issued Letter of Findings demonstrates HUD’s commitment to upholding our Nation’s civil rights laws.” HUD’s investigation found that residents began harassing the complainants, a White mother and daughter, when the daughter began dating a Black man and was seen with this man at the property. HUD’s investigation found that complainants repeatedly notified Cushing Housing of this harassment, but that Cushing Housing failed to take any steps to address it. The pervasive harassment included calling the complainants racial slurs and threatening racially motivated violence. Despite being on notice of this harassment, Cushing failed to take prompt and effect steps reasonably calculated to end it, instead ultimately issuing a notice to vacate to both the complainant mother as well as the harassers, which HUD found to be unlawful retaliation against the mother for the reporting racial harassment. In addition to the $300,000 payment to complainants and an aggrieved individual, the agreement requires Cushing Housing to establish an anti-harassment policy as well as a fair housing and civil rights compliance policy. Both policies must be made available to all tenants and include formal grievance procedures. Respondents are also required to obtain fair housing and civil rights training for all officers, agents, and employees. People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 877-8339 (Relay).

"Friday, December 8, 2023",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_274,New Report: HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge Delivers Unprecedented Homeownership Achievements,"WASHINGTON – When the Biden-Harris Administration and Secretary Fudge took office, Americans were facing numerous challenges, including the COVID-19 pandemic, a lack of affordable housing supply, and rapidly increasing home prices. In spite of these headwinds, concerted efforts by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) have helped millions of American households obtain or maintain homeownership. HUD has used all the tools at its disposal, through the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae) and the Office of Native American Programs to help American families. “At HUD, we have successfully implemented programs that have kept people in their homes and advanced opportunities for families of all incomes, especially low- and moderate-income families,” said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “Since the start of the Administration, we have made great strides to address historical discrimination in housing, created significant opportunities for first-time homebuyers, and invested in programs to bridge the wealth gap and create paths to homeownership.” “Under Secretary Fudge's leadership, the Federal Housing Administration has exhibited an unprecedented commitment to furthering homeownership for more of the nation's families,” said Assistant Secretary for Housing and Federal Housing Commissioner Julia Gordon. “With this commitment, we've been able to remove many barriers to homeownership and wealth building, particularly for households of color, through FHA programs.” HUD has achieved significant milestones, with a clear focus on expanding access to homeownership, supporting home retention through the pandemic, and addressing racial bias. Here are some of the things we have accomplished: QUICK FACTS Reducing barriers for first-time home buyers. Through a 35 percent reduction in the pricing of FHA’s mortgage insurance premiums implemented in March 2023, 425,000 borrowers are saving more than $336 million in aggregate in the first year of their mortgages. FHA estimates the total cost savings over the forecasted life of these mortgages is up to $1.9 billion. As it has for more than eight decades, FHA remained a vital means of access to homeownership for first-time homebuyers, with more than 80 percent of FHA-insured purchase mortgages going to first-time homebuyers in each of the last three years. Throughout the first three years of this Administration, FHA has supported nearly 1.8 million homeowners with purchasing mortgages, 83.5 percent or 1.5 million of whom are first-time homebuyers. This past year alone, FHA’s first-time-homebuyer rate by share of originations is almost 40 percentage points higher than the conventional mortgage market. During that same time period, HUD worked to further expand access to homeownership by reducing some of the obstacles that prevent qualified borrowers from obtaining mortgage credit. FHA revised its policies for the treatment of student loan debt in the underwriting of FHA-insured mortgages to ensure that all borrowers were being evaluated fairly and allowed a borrower’s positive rental history to be included in evaluations of their creditworthiness for an FHA-insured mortgage. To increase the supply of available homeownership housing, HUD changed its property disposition policies to prioritize purchases by owner-occupants and non-profit organizations over investors. To educate and prepare prospective homebuyers, HUD continued to promote and encourage consultation with the more than 4,000 HUD-certified housing counselors available nationwide. The agency also updated its policies to ensure survivors of domestic violence with FHA-insured mortgages can access necessary loss mitigation programs to help retain their homes and avoid foreclosure.

Helping homeowners stay in their homes during the pandemic. From the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic through the end of fiscal year 2023, almost two million FHA and ONAP homeowners affected by COVID-19 obtained a forbearance, a temporary pause or reduction in mortgage payments, to stay in their homes as they sought options to return to long-term, sustainable mortgage payments and bring their mortgages current. In 2021, FHA and ONAP acted quickly to offer new options for homeowners to become current on their mortgages whether or not they had obtained a forbearance, simplifying processes for borrowers and lenders and developing new options to reduce mortgage payments for homeowners facing financial hardship. Through continuous refinement of its loss mitigation home retention options, from March 2020 through September 30, 2023, FHA and ONAP helped or is in the process of helping more than 1.1 million struggling homeowners keep their homes through mortgage modifications and other permanent monthly payment reductions.

HUD led a first of its kind interagency taskforce committed to rooting out racial and ethnic bias in home valuations, the Property Appraisal and Valuation Equity task force (PAVE). HUD partnered with the Federal Housing Finance Agency and signed a historic Memorandum of Understanding to collaborate on fair housing and fair lending enforcements. HUD clarified that Special Purpose Credit Programs, authorized by the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, are not otherwise prohibited by the Fair Housing Act, which opened new lending programs for underserved households and communities.

"Friday, December 8, 2023",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_273,Biden-Harris Administration Calls on Housing Community to Help Expand Access to Life-Saving Opioid Overdose Reversal Medications Like Naloxone,"WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a joint letter to public health departments and health care systems to partner with housing providers, community development organizations, and other housing agencies to help expand access to naloxone and other life-saving overdose reversal medications in the communities they serve. Housing providers play an important role in the whole-of-society effort to save lives by ensuring that all public spaces have lifesaving overdose reversal medications on hand and people are prepared to use it. Overdose reversal medications that can reverse an opioid-related overdose, including fentanyl-related overdose; can be found in many schools, libraries, and other community institutions; and should be readily available in and around public housing settings, multifamily housing programs, housing counseling offices, and programs for people experiencing homelessness. “Many overdoses happen in the home, and providing access to an effective and easy-to-use medication that can reverse an overdose is just common sense,” said Assistant Secretary for Housing and Federal Housing Commissioner Julia Gordon. “We urge our assisted housing property owners and managers to make this life-saving medication readily available to their residents and guests.” “With recent advancements in lifesaving medications, I encourage our local partners offering housing and services to people at risk of drug overdose to use every resource available to prevent death and complications,” said Marion McFadden, HUD Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development. “Through a coordinated response from local communities, recipients of federal funding, and healthcare partners, we can beat the overdose epidemic.” “Our fact sheet made clear that no person who lives in public housing or housing units assisted by housing vouchers should risk losing their lives or the lives of their loved ones to overdoses out of fear of losing their housing,” said Richard Monocchio, HUD’s Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing. “Naloxone and other overdose reversal medications save lives and should be as available in public housing as smoke detectors and fire extinguishers.” “With his Unity Agenda, President Biden set a clear directive: we must all come together to address the nation’s overdose epidemic,” said ONDCP Deputy Director Adam Cohen. “Not only are we working closely across federal agencies, but with partners at the state, local, and community levels to save lives and ensure everyone has the resources they need to stay healthy and thrive. Expanding access to overdose reversal medication is a key priority of this Administration, and we will continue doing all we can to get this lifesaving tool in communities throughout the country.” “The epidemic’s ability to change over time demands a flexible and collective response as a federal family,” said Assistant Secretary for Health, ADM Rachel L. Levine. “By working together at the federal, state, and local levels, we can extend access to Naloxone and other opioid reversal agents to create healthy communities and build a healthy nation for all.” “We all have a role to play in ending the overdose epidemic,” said Miriam E. Delphin-Rittmon, Ph.D., HHS Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use and the leader of SAMHSA. “Naloxone and other opioid overdose reversal medications save lives. Ensuring these medications are broadly distributed in these housing-related settings is an important step to help communities prevent fatal overdoses. These medications should be as readily available as other health-and-safety equipment like carbon monoxide detectors, fire extinguishers, and defibrillators.” Addressing the overdose epidemic is a key priority of President Biden’s Unity Agenda, which focuses on issues where all Americans can come together and make progress for the nation. In support of this Unity Agenda priority, HHS, HUD and ONDCP are committed to working together and with communities to improve access to life-saving measures, destigmatize substance use disorder, and promote recovery. Overdose reversal medications are truly lifesaving, rapidly reversing the effects of opioid overdose. The FDA approved certain naloxone nasal sprays for non-prescription, over-the-counter use in March and July of this year. Now, for the first time ever, naloxone is available for over-the-counter purchase at grocery stores and pharmacies across the country. Other opioid overdose reversal medications are available with a prescription and may be covered by health insurers. Expanding access to overdose reversal medications is a key part of President Biden’s National Drug Control Strategy. The Biden-Harris Administration has invested historic amounts of funding in the State Opioid Response (SOR) grant program for states and tribes to make overdose reversal medications available to their residents at no cost. Using federal SOR grant dollars, states have purchased nearly 9 million naloxone kits and helped reverse more than 500,000 overdoses. Over the past two years, the Administration has taken historic action to increase access to this life-saving tool, including: Convening U.S. drug manufacturers who have FDA-approved overdose reversal medication products to discuss ways to increase access and affordability to save more lives; Launching a campaign to educate young people on the dangers of fentanyl and the life-saving effects of naloxone with the Ad Council; Facilitating the availability of naloxone to harm reduction organizations directly from manufacturers and distributors to support expanded public access to this critical medicine. Supporting states through enhanced technical assistance, policy academies, and convenings to ensure existing State Opioid Response funds are used to saturate hard-hit communities with naloxone; Delivering funds directly to states so they can purchase opioid overdose reversal medications; and Calling for an additional $100 million for harm reduction services like naloxone in the President’s FY24 budget request. Earlier this fall, as naloxone became available for over-the-counter purchase for the first time ever, ONDCP Director Dr. Rahul Gupta joined HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra and senior HHS leadership for a live naloxone demonstration event to educate HHS staff and the public on the importance of increasing awareness, reducing stigmatization, and expanding access to lifesaving overdose reversal medications. There are many forms of overdose reversal medications to meet the needs of different populations.

"Wednesday, December 6, 2023",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_271,HUD and DOE Announce New Partnership to Decarbonize U.S. Building Sector at COP28,"WASHINGTON - Today, at the 28th U.N. Climate Conference (COP28), the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced new initiatives to address the challenges posed by the climate crisis and ensure that low- and moderate-income households and communities can benefit from a clean energy transition. These announcements include a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Department of Energy to work together on domestic efforts to reduce carbon emissions in the building sector and to cut costs for consumers through energy efficiency improvements. HUD also announced that it was joining the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy’s United States Global Change Research Program (USGCRP), to guide and contribute to the U.S. government's scientific research on global climate change and ensure that state-of-the art research and data on climate change benefits the people and communities that HUD serves. HUD senior leaders have joined the U.S. delegation to COP28, led by Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry. Senior U.S. officials from over 20 U.S. departments and agencies, along with civil society leaders from across the U.S., have traveled to Dubai, United Arab Emirates, to advance U.S. climate goals. At COP, the U.S. also joined the UNEP Buildings Breakthrough. Participating countries endorse the statement ‘Near-zero emission and resilient buildings are the new normal by 2030’. The Buildings Breakthrough mobilizes international collaboration to accelerate the transition of the building sector to zero emissions and resiliency. “The new partnerships that we are announcing today underscore our strong and enduring commitment to energy efficiency and climate resiliency for our nation’s communities, homes, buildings, and infrastructure. It also underscores our commitment to sharing research on climate impacts faced by those most at risk,” said U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Marcia L. Fudge. ""HUD will continue to work closely with the Department of Energy fortify homes and communities across the country, ensuring they are prepared to response to the challenges posed by the climate crisis through mitigation, adaptation and resilience."" “Today’s announcement reinforces the Biden-Harris Administration’s whole-of-government effort to lower costs for working families and ensure the benefits of the transition to a cleaner energy future are fully accessible, especially to those in low-income areas and underserved communities,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. “This new partnership will allow DOE and HUD to leverage each other’s expertise to deliver on President Biden’s commitment to provide more affordable and healthier housing for Americans while also reducing deadly emissions that fuel the climate crisis.” These announcements respond to both the changing patterns of human settlements and the role that the building sector plays in greenhouse gas emissions. By 2050, it is projected nearly 70 percent of the world's population will reside in urban areas. And it is estimated that, today, the building sector accounts for nearly 40 percent of annual greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) globally. Along with its federal partners, HUD is committed to reducing GHG emissions in the U.S. building sector and leveraging the best available science to ensure that our homes and urban communities are built to withstand climate risks. In another important advancement, the White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy has named HUD the 15th member of the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP). USGCRP is a consortia of federal member agencies that coordinate federal research and investments in understanding the forces shaping the global environment, both human and natural, and their impacts on society. HUD brings important insights and perspectives to USGCRP, drawing from its work increasing climate resilience in low-income and climate-vulnerable communities, its experience preparing communities for and helping them respond to more frequent climate-related disasters, and its commitment to environmental justice. “HUD will bring important perspectives on the needs of the households and communities that the department serves,” said Arati Prabhakar, Assistant to the President for Science and Technology and Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP). “As our climate changes, it is crucial that every community is prepared and resilient. That’s why HUD’s voice is so important in USGCRP, which is charged with answering our nation’s most urgent global change questions.” “Joining USGCRP it a major step forward for HUD – and the communities we serve – in ensuring that we can benefit from the best available data, research and evidence on climate change and how it is affecting the housing and community development needs of those American communities most vulnerable to climate challenges,” said Solomon J. Greene, HUD’s Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research. “HUD is excited to apply state-of-the art research and data tools developed by USGCRP members to advance HUD’s mission and our Climate Action Plan, and to strengthen our nation’s preparedness and resilience against climate change.” To correspond with COP28, HUD has also released the following fact sheets on its ambitious work to build climate resilience: U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Update on Climate Action Plan U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is Investing in Building Climate Resilient Communities Amidst More Frequent and More Intense Climate-related Disasters U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Works to “Future-Proof Housing” Through Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law Investments and Other Actions HUD continues to implement a Climate Action Plan with the objective of developing an equitable nationwide building decarbonization framework.

"Wednesday, December 6, 2023",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_270,HUD Launches Free Energy and Water Benchmarking Service for HUD-Assisted Multifamily Properties,"New service funded under the Inflation Reduction Act furthers President Biden’s Investing in America agenda and promotes green investments in rental homes for low-income families WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today makes its Energy and Water Benchmarking Service available for properties participating in its Multifamily project-based rental assistance programs. This new, free service provides participating multifamily property owners with data on energy and water consumption at their properties. The data provided will aid property owners in identifying opportunities for energy efficiency improvements that can benefit residents and promote green investments in individual properties or entire property portfolios. Property owners can also use the information to assess rehabilitation efforts that may be eligible for grant or loan funding under HUD’s Green and Resilient Retrofit Program (GRRP) or other sources of funding. This action was announced as HUD senior leaders join the U.S. delegation to COP28, led by Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry. Senior U.S. officials from over 20 U.S. departments and agencies, along with civil society leaders from across the U.S., have traveled to Dubai, United Arab Emirates, to advance U.S. climate goals. “President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act provided historic funds to make U.S. homes more climate-resilient than ever,” said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “As a part of those investments, HUD is launching a first-of-its-kind, free service to give owners data insights on their properties’ water and energy consumption, helping them find ways to increase efficiency and promote green investments.” “Along with the Green and Resilient Retrofit Program, the benchmarking service puts the historic Inflation Reduction Act funding to work in communities that are too often overlooked,” said Assistant Secretary for Housing Julia Gordon. “This program reinforces our ongoing commitment to efficient, safe, and healthy homes in all communities.” President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act—the largest climate investment in history—established the GRRP with more than $800 million in grant funding and $4 billion in loan commitment authority. GRRP is the first HUD program to simultaneously invest in energy efficiency, renewable energy generation, climate resilience, and low-embodied-carbon materials in HUD-assisted multifamily housing. Investments under the program will be made in affordable housing communities serving low-income families in accordance with President Biden’s agenda for building the American economy from the middle out and the bottom up. Funded with $42.5 million through the Biden-Harris Administration’s Inflation Reduction Act, the benchmarking service announced today is free for owners of properties participating in HUD’s Multifamily Assisted Housing programs, including Section 8 project-based rental assistance, Section 202 Housing for Low-Income Elderly, Section 811 Housing for Low-Income Persons with Disabilities, and Section 236 Preservation programs. Owners that choose to participate in HUD’s benchmarking service can use the resulting data to apply for GRRP grants and loans under the Comprehensive cohort, as well as to comply with the general GRRP benchmarking requirement. This data can also help owners understand and qualify for other energy and water efficiency programs funded by IRA or through their local jurisdictions and utilities. The benchmarking service offers owners: Specific information about a property’s energy and water performance, comparisons of this usage with similar properties, and recommendations for savings; Benchmarking analytics from the ENERGY STAR® Portfolio Manager®, a tool developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; and Technical assistance, training, and other resources. “The Energy and Water Benchmarking Service provides free help to properties as a part of our work through the GRRP to make multifamily assisted housing more energy efficient and climate resilient,” said Deputy Assistant Secretary for Multifamily Housing Programs Ethan Handelman. “Benchmarking data will not only assist individual properties and their residents, but it will also contribute to an aggregate understanding of energy use throughout our assisted housing portfolio.” HUD estimates up to 9,000 properties may choose to participate in this service. HUD’s contractor, Leidos, will be contacting property owners throughout the coming months to discuss the program and solicit participation. Owners may also contact HUD at mfbenchmarking@hud.gov to participate. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Monday, December 4, 2023",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/fact_sheet_cop28,FACT SHEET: U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is Investing in Building Climate Resilient Communities Amidst More Frequent and More Intense Climate-related Disasters,"The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is leading efforts to further the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to invest in climate change resilience. HUD is taking action to ensure equitable access to climate-related disaster recovery resources for communities in need. In response to the nation’s climate crisis, HUD has increased its resilience measures, invested in building resilient communities, and supported communities recovering from disasters. HUD continues to develop new, robust initiatives and actions to help communities rebuild and recover from extreme weather events. The agency is leading efforts in grant program building standards to ensure taxpayer dollars are used for climate-informed investments. As HUD works to implement preparedness, response and recovery efforts, the agency has: Improved disaster recovery efforts to better serve communities who face the direct impacts of weather-related disasters: Based on the increasing number of disasters and the increasingly important role that HUD plays in the federal government’s preparedness, response, and recovery efforts, the Department established a new Office of Disaster Management within the Office of the Deputy Secretary and an Office of Disaster Recovery within the Office of Community Planning and Development. HUD also, for the first time, through two Requests for Information (RFIs), asked the public for feedback on how to simplify, modernize, and more equitably distribute critical disaster recovery funds -- Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) and Mitigation (CDBG-MIT). Provided $6.7 billion in disaster assistance through Community Development Block Grant-Disaster Recovery: To help states and local communities recover from disasters that occurred in 2021 and 2022, HUD has allocated $6.7 billion in Community Development Block Grant-Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) funds to help them build back resiliently. Developed practical, flexible technical guidance to improve housing resilience: In May 2023, HUD published Designing for Natural Hazards: A Resilience Guide for Builders and Developers, a series of practical guides for builders and developers to design and construct residential buildings that are resilient to major categories of natural hazards. The resilience guides provide technical content in a straightforward way that is easy for a layperson to understand, while also providing references through which design professionals, builders, developers, and public officials can obtain full details. These guides build upon HUD’s robust library of technical assistance resources, toolkits and implementation guides on disaster recovery, climate resilience and adaptation. They also complement HUD’s deep technical assistance work and partnerships with local leaders in communities to improve housing resilience. Efforts like HUD’s Climate Communities Initiative (CCI) provides a variety of resources and assistance to selected entitlement communities over an 18-month period to advance long-term climate resilience and environmental justice. Increased climate resiliency through proposed code and standards updates: HUD issued for public comment a Federal Flood Risk Management Standard Rule that proposes for adoption a forward-looking standard that considers future flood risk, increasing the Nation’s resilience to flooding, reducing the risk of flood loss, minimizing the impact of floods on households across the country, and protecting federal investments against future risk and increased harm. The proposed changes adopt climate-informed science and would impact properties funded or insured by HUD. Funded investments in climate resilience: HUD’s Green and Resilient Retrofit Program (GRRP), funded by the Inflation Reduction Act, is the first HUD program to prioritize both energy efficiency and climate resilience. Applications from qualified Multifamily Rental Assisted properties are evaluated based on a combined energy and climate risk score, ensuring properties at highest risk are priorities for wholistic evaluation and investment. HUD has increased the resources and flexibility disaster-stricken communities need to respond quickly and recover equitably by: Creating new flexibility through waivers: HUD acted quickly after the worst disasters to provide maximum flexibility to recipients of our annual funds to make changes as their priorities for the dollars shift. Assisting impacted communities with technical assistance and capacity building support: In the wake of the devastating wildfires in Maui, Hawaii. HUD coordinated technical assistance with state and local recovery efforts in the areas affected by wildfires. HUD provided homeowners and renters with HUD-Certified Housing Counselor assistance, helping with immediate housing needs and long-term recovery. Supporting people who were experiencing or at risk of homelessness pre-disaster: Responding to the surge in shelter needs that could be exacerbated by a disaster, HUD created a first-of-its kind funding programs, awarding $1.3 million to the State of Hawaii following the Maui fires and $6.8 million to the State of Florida and seven of the State’s localities. This funding assists communities in addressing homelessness and helps ensure that most people experiencing homelessness are not forgotten. HUD has taken action to help communities move forward: Louisiana reached an agreement to free 3,000 Louisianans from Road Home Program repayment obligations: Through a corrective action with HUD, Louisiana agreed to forego legal actions and free 3,300 homeowners of their Road Home Program-related debt obligations. Through the agreement, Louisiana will not require repayments from impacted homeowners providing financial freedom from Road Home-related debt, affording repairs, and empowering property resale without liens or payment plans. ###"
"Monday, December 4, 2023",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/fact_sheet_climate_action_plan,FACT SHEET: U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Update on Climate Action Plan,"Two years ago, at COP 26, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced the release of its Climate Action Plan. The Climate Action Plan was developed in response to President Biden's Executive Order on Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad and is a comprehensive strategy to reduce the agency’s energy and carbon footprint and put our nation’s communities on the path to building more equitable, efficient, and sustainable housing infrastructure. It sets forth a broad approach to the climate crisis that reduces climate pollution; increases resilience to the impacts of climate change; protects public health; delivers environmental justice; and spurs well-paying union jobs and economic growth. HUD’s Climate Action Plan details the agency’s first steps as part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s whole-of-government approach to confronting the climate crisis. Two years into implementation of HUD’s Climate Action Plan, under the Biden-Harris Administration, U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Marcia L. Fudge has taken bold action, eliminating barriers, increasing collaboration, and working to ensure federal investments will benefit all people and communities, especially historically disadvantaged communities, and those most at risk to the threats posed by climate change and extreme weather. HUD has made significant progress towards its climate mitigation and resilience, energy efficiency, and environmental justice goals through the following measures: Advanced increased energy efficiency in HUD-supported housing through updated notices, incentives, and technical assistance for housing authorities to invest in energy and water efficiency, including solar – providing cost savings, cleaner air, and greenhouse gas mitigation. Raised the Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) minimum energy efficiency standards applicable to new construction activities and required ownership teams to participate in climate resilience planning through supplemental notice. Published updated public and assisted housing guidance for treatment of solar programs, provided supplementary guidance on financial incentives to promote energy conservation and other actions to make it easier to participate and benefit from clean energy generation.

"Monday, December 4, 2023",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/fact_sheet_future_proof_housing,FACT SHEET: U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Works to “Future-Proof Housing” Through Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law Investments and Other Actions,"As the federal agency dedicated to creating strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is on the front lines of the nation’s efforts to tackle the climate crisis, build resilient communities, and address environmental injustice. Under the Biden-Harris Administration’s whole-of-government approach, HUD is working across the federal government to identify investment opportunities under the historic Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) to ensure America’s homes are healthier and more resilient, with increased access to energy efficient appliances and improved insulation, heating, cooling, and ventilation systems to address extreme temperatures, air pollution, and contaminants. These substantial investments in housing, extend beyond HUD programs, providing tools, opportunities and incentives for partners and stakeholders across the nation to advance climate-resilient and energy efficient homes for the future. HUD is leading investments in housing. In 2023, the Department awarded $121.4 million in new loans and grants to renovate the homes of 5,860 households for low-income families, seniors, and persons with disabilities at 44 HUD-Assisted Multifamily Housing properties— as part of its IRA funded Green and Resilient Retrofit Program (GRRP). These investments will support working families and modest income individuals by making upgrades that could otherwise be cost-prohibitive to increase resilience and energy efficiency while enhancing their lives at home by structurally modernizing the homes. GRRP is the first program that simultaneously invests in energy efficiency, renewable energy generation, climate resilience, and low embodied carbon materials in HUD-assisted multifamily housing. Over the next year, HUD will award the remainder of the $800 million in grant and loan subsidy funding and $4 billion in loan commitment authority provided by the IRA, helping to future proof more HUD Multifamily assisted housing, benefitting residents and furthering environmental justice. To better target opportunities to save energy and water, cut costs, and reduce emissions in affordable housing, HUD launched an initiative earlier this year to collect and assess energy and water usage data from HUD-assisted multifamily housing. Funded under IRA, this $42.5 million investment aims to assist some roughly 9,000 Multifamily assisted housing property owners in understanding energy and water usage at their properties, providing critical baseline information often needed by owners to access climate related funding resources. To help users identify those funding resources, in September 2023, HUD announced the launch of the web-based Funding Navigator, a searchable database of funding available under IRA, BIL and other resources that support climate related investments in housing and communities. A component of President Biden’s commitment to invest in America, this interactive tool connects program participants to funding opportunities across federal agencies to support climate resiliency, energy efficiency, renewable energy integration, healthy housing, workforce development and environmental justice in HUD supported communities, programs, and properties. Additionally, HUD released the Climate Resource for Housing Supply Framework as a part of the agency’s work to increase the supply of affordable and sustainable housing. The framework aims to raise awareness about available funding for addressing the housing shortage and climate change, while also showcasing methods to increase project viability by integrating new funding sources with existing resources. To make it easier for HUD supported housing and residents to understand and participate in solar programs, HUD’s Office of Multifamily Housing and Public and Indian Housing published guidance on the treatment of financial benefits from community solar energy programs or on-site solar facilities. This helps residents benefit from the expansion of clean energy programs like the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Investment Tax Credit Low-Income Solar Adders (48e) and the Environmental Protection Agency’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, two programs that defer to HUD’s guidance on solar participation benefits. HUD also partnered with the Department of Energy (DOE) to promote the Buildings Upgrade Prize (Buildings UP), an initiative by the DOE Building Technologies Office to build capacity to accelerate equitable, widespread energy efficiency and efficient electrification building upgrades across the country. In October 2023, DOE awarded 33 Phase I Equity Track grants of $400,000, over 85% of all Equity Track grants, for innovative partnerships to scale energy efficiency building upgrades/ electrification in low- and moderate-income communities. This investment will help support the transformation of existing U.S. buildings into more energy-efficient and clean energy-ready homes, commercial spaces, and communities. HUD is helping to increase awareness around how to build for the future by collaborating with other agencies on trainings, webinars and other events focused on housing and community development. In February 2023, HUD’s Office of Housing invited DOE to participate in housing counseling trainings with HUD’s housing counselors on the key role of energy efficiency in boosting housing affordability and improving health, safety, and comfort. The trainings also included the value of incentive programs, loan products, rebates, and other resources to help renters, homebuyers, and homeowners achieve cost savings and build wealth through energy efficiency and guidance on how to navigate federal, state and local programs in their region, including various IRA initiatives. In June 2023, HUD, as part of its Housing Innovation Showcase, hosted a pre-showcase session at the National Building Museum in Washington D.C. focused on “energy efficiency, resilience, and decarbonization,” bringing together panelists from DOE, EPA, and industry stakeholders to discuss strategies to decarbonize the built environment. Panelists and speakers shared new technologies and strategies that can reduce structures’ energy costs and carbon footprint and highlighted recent developments under IRA and BIL. As part of the National Initiative to Advance Building Codes (NIABC), a whole-of-government initiative to align minimum codes and standards for buildings funded through federal agency programs, HUD is meeting its obligations. HUD has published its Resilient Building Codes Toolkit, bringing transparency and clarity to building codes, especially with respect to resilience. In May 2023, HUD published a proposed notice with the U.S. Department of Agriculture to update its minimum energy code standards. Energy cost savings from the proposed updates are estimated to be almost 35% for single-family or low-rise multifamily housing homes and will generate an estimated reduction of 2.2 million metric tons of CO2. HUD is also part of the Thriving Communities Initiative, a joint agency effort between the U.S. Department of Transportation and HUD to provide place-based technical assistance to communities to plan and transform infrastructure and community development projects. It provides technical assistance, planning, and capacity building to ensure that disadvantaged communities adversely or disproportionately affected by environmental, climate, and human health policy outcomes have the technical tools and organizational capacity to compete for Federal aid and deliver quality infrastructure projects that enable their communities and neighborhoods to thrive. Investing in nature, particularly in nature-deprived communities, advances HUD’s broader goal for resilient, equitable, inclusive community development. HUD funding can be used for nature-based solutions and urban forestry, decreasing the heat island effect, increasing resilience, and improving access to open space and nature. In September, HUD was excited to see almost half (50%) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s nearly 400 recipients of funding under the $1 billion Urban Forestry Grants awarded to HUD Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) communities, expanding access to trees and green spaces in communities and neighborhoods nationwide through the Investing in America agenda. ###"

The property has 100 apartment units for low-income seniors, including a large Chinese American immigrant population. HUD vouchers are used for 100% of the units. The Secretary then visited Nehemiah Spring Creek with EBC and their partners to hear from stakeholders about the evolving role faith institutions and developers of color can play toward increasing the supply of affordable housing and homeownership opportunities for underserved communities. Nehemiah Spring Creek is a multiphase initiative that is transforming 45 acres of former wetlands into a modern and model suburban, mixed-income, smart-growth community that offers over 1,600 affordable apartment rentals and townhouse homeownership, as well as retail. The community includes public schools, family health and medical facilities, dining options, and human services. It is also near the Gateway Center, one of Brooklyn’s newest shopping centers. The project received public and private investments and benefits from HUD resources for sustainability. “In New York City, I toured local housing developments, met with residents, and spoke to leaders in housing finance,” said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “To lower housing costs we must build more affordable housing and preserve the housing we have. Public private partnerships like the ones I saw in Brooklyn are promising steps forward.” See photos from Secretary Fudge’s New York trip here: For additional photos and b-roll video footage of the Secretary’s trip, reach out to us at HUDPressOffice@HUD.gov. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Friday, December 1, 2023",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_267,HUD Announces Proposed “30-Day Notice” Rule for Nonpayment of Rent,"Proposed rule would provide residents of public housing or in properties receiving project-based rental assistance 30 days notice to cure lease violations for nonpayment of rent WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) will publish a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the Federal Register on Friday, December 1. If finalized, the rule would require public housing agencies (PHA) with tenants in public housing and owners of properties participating in HUD Multifamily project-based rental assistance programs to provide their tenants with written notification at least 30 days prior to filing for an eviction due to nonpayment of rent in court. The proposed rule would also require that the 30-day notice include instructions on how tenants can cure lease violations for nonpayment of rent and information on how to recertify their income and request a minimum rent hardship exemption if applicable to avoid eviction. “HUD-assisted rental housing allows millions of people to achieve stability for themselves and their families,” said Solomon Greene, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research. “This proposed rule would give many HUD-assisted renters an opportunity to catch up if they fall behind on rent and avoid the harmful consequences of evictions, while also preventing landlords and PHAs from encountering costly unit vacancies.” “Preventing unnecessary evictions benefits properties and residents alike, in part because the eviction process itself can be costly and time-consuming for all concerned,” said Richard J. Monocchio, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing. “We are very proud of this proposed rule, and we welcome feedback from all interested stakeholders to make it even more practical and effective.” This proposed rule would affect an estimated 3.9 million people in 2.2 million households – 1.7 million people in 840,000 households in public housing and 2.2 million people in 1.4 million households in PBRA programs. Stakeholders can access the proposed rule here and have 60 days following publication in the Federal Register on December 1 to provide comment on the proposed rule. This action also fulfills a commitment HUD made in the Biden-Harris Administration’s Blueprint for a Renters Bill of Rights. In July 2023, HUD also joined the White House to announce three new actions to increase fairness in the rental market and further renter protections in housing: a preview of this notice of proposed rulemaking, an effort to remind public housing agencies and property owners of their obligations and to share best practices for informing rejected applicants about why they were turned down for housing, and $10 million made available for tenant education and outreach in properties supported by the Section 8 Project-Based Rental Assistance program.

"Wednesday, November 29, 2023",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_266,FHA Proposes Enhancements to Make Home Rehabilitation Program More Effective for Homebuyers and Homeowners,"Proposed changes to the 203(k) Rehabilitation Mortgage Insurance Program are designed to expand FHA-insured mortgage financing for families purchasing or refinancing single family homes in need of repair or rehabilitation. WASHINGTON - Today, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) posted proposed changes to its 203(k) Rehabilitation Mortgage Insurance Program for industry feedback. The 203(k) program is designed to help borrowers purchase a home or refinance an existing mortgage and include the cost of repairs or rehabilitation into one new mortgage. The proposed changes would update key provisions of the program and are designed to make it more useful for today’s market, increase flexibility for borrowers, and decrease operational burdens for lenders, 203(k) Consultants, and other program participants. “At HUD, we are focused on ensuring Americans can make the repairs necessary to keep their homes safe and energy efficient,” said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “Thanks to the enhancements we proposed today, home rehabilitation will be more accessible for millions of homebuyers and homeowners through the Federal Housing Administration.” FHA’s Standard 203(k) program can be used for both remodeling and rehabilitation, including structural repairs such as repairing a foundation, and requires the use of an FHA-approved 203(k) Consultant. The Limited 203(k) program may only be used for minor renovation and non-structural repairs, such as installing energy saving improvements, and does not require the use of a 203(k) Consultant. “We are committed to making this program work well for the nation’s homebuyers and homeowners,” said Assistant Secretary for Housing and Federal Housing Commissioner Julia Gordon. “Our proposed changes to the 203(k) program add to our larger goals of increasing both housing supply and affordability through FHA’s offerings.” The proposals announced today reflect input FHA received from its Request for Information published in the Federal Register on February 14, 2023, and include: Increasing the maximum allowable rehabilitation costs for the Limited 203(k) program from $35,000 to $50,000 ($75,000 in high-cost areas) to address increased costs associated with repairs. Allowing 203(k) Consultant Fees to be included in the financed mortgage amount for the Limited 203(k) program, as is currently permissible in the Standard 203(k) program. Increasing the allowable rehabilitation period for the Standard 203(k) program from six months to 10 months, and for the Limited 203(k) program from six months to seven months, to account for longer repair and rehabilitation timeframes common for more complex projects. Increasing the allowable initial draw amount to include up to 75 percent of material costs, versus the 50 percent permitted under the existing policy, so the borrower can make payment to a supplier or manufacturer. Updating the 203(k) Consultant Fee schedule, including a streamlining of and substantial increases for, allowable fees for preparation of work write-ups and architectural exhibit reviews. FHA is also proposing increases to the maximum amount for other allowable fees, including the Draw Inspection Fee and the Change Order Request Fee. Proposed fee increases are designed to appropriately compensate Consultants for their role and incent more Consultants to participate in the program. “The thoughtful responses we received from the industry through our February request for help in identifying barriers to program use were instrumental in the development of these proposed policy updates,” said Deputy Assistant Secretary for Single Family Housing Sarah Edelman. “We are looking forward to receiving feedback on the draft Mortgagee Letter so that we can move forward to final policy updates.” FHA is accepting feedback on its proposed 203(k) program updates, using the instructions posted on its Single Family Drafting Table web page, through January 5, 2024. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Tuesday, November 28, 2023",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_265,"FHA Announces 2024 Loan Limits, Empowering Homebuyers Amidst Rising Home Prices","The Federal Housing Administration announces new loan limits on Title II forward and Home Equity Conversion Mortgages for 2024 for single-family homes WASHINGTON - Today, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) is announcing new loan limits for calendar year 2024 for its Single Family Title II forward and Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) insurance programs. Loan limits for most of the country will increase in the coming year due to continued strong home price appreciation over the past year. “The statutory loan limit increases announced today reflect the continued rise in home prices seen throughout most of the nation in 2023,” said Assistant Secretary for Housing and Federal Housing Commissioner Julia Gordon. “The increases to FHA’s loan limits will enable homebuyers to use FHA’s low-down-payment financing to access homeownership at a time when a lack of affordability threatens to shut well qualified borrowers out of the market.” FHA is required to update its annual loan limits each year using a formula prescribed in the National Housing Act. This formula uses county or Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) home sale data to derive new loan limits for the three different cost categories established by the law. Forward Mortgage Loan Limits The new forward mortgage loan limits in the table below are effective for FHA case numbers assigned on or after January 1, 2024. Mortgage limits for the special exception areas of Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands are adjusted by FHA to account for higher costs of construction. The maximum loan limits for FHA forward mortgages will rise in 3,138 counties. In 96 counties, FHA’s loan limits will remain unchanged. HECM Loan Limits The HECM maximum claim amount will increase from $1,089,300 in calendar year 2023 to $1,149,825 effective for FHA case numbers assigned on or after January 1, 2024. This maximum claim amount is applicable to all areas, including the special exception areas of Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Calculation of Loan Limits FHA is required by the National Housing Act (NHA), as amended by the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA), to set Single Family forward mortgage loan limits at 115 percent of area median house prices for a particular jurisdiction, subject to a specified floor and a ceiling. In accordance with the NHA, FHA calculates forward mortgage limits by MSA and county. The NHA requires FHA to establish its floor and ceiling loan limits based on the national conforming loan limit set by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) for conventional mortgages owned or guaranteed by the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac). The national conforming loan limit for 2024 for a one-unit property is $766,550. FHA’s 2024 minimum national loan limit floor of $498,257 for a one-unit property is set at 65 percent of the national conforming loan limit. This floor applies to those areas where 115 percent of the median home price is less than the floor limit. Any area where the loan limit exceeds this floor is considered a high-cost area. In these areas, FHA establishes varying loan limits above the floor based upon the respective median home prices in each area. The NHA requires FHA to set its maximum loan limit ceiling for high-cost areas at $1,149,825, which is 150 percent of the national conforming loan limit. Forward mortgage limits for the special exception areas of Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands are adjusted further by FHA to account for higher costs of construction. Additionally, the FHA-insured HECM maximum claim amount is calculated at 150 percent of the Freddie Mac national conforming limit of $766,550. FHA’s current HECM regulations do not allow the HECM limit to vary by MSA or county; instead, the single HECM limit applies to all HECMs regardless of where the property is located.

"Monday, November 27, 2023",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_264,HUD and Census Bureau Report New Residential Sales in October 2023,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Census Bureau jointly announced the following new residential sales statistics for October 2023: New Home Sales Sales of new single‐family houses in October 2023 were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 679,000, according to estimates released jointly today by the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. This is 5.6 percent (±12.3 percent)* below the revised September rate of 719,000, and is 17.7 percent (±17.9 percent)* above the October 2022 estimate of 577,000. Sales Price The median sales price of new houses sold in October 2023 was $409,300. The average sales price was $487,000. For Sale Inventory and Months’ Supply The seasonally‐adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of October was 439,000. This represents a supply of 7.8 months at the current sales rate. The November report is scheduled for release on December 22, 2023. View the full schedule in the Economic Briefing Room: www.census.gov/economic‐indicators/. The full text and tables for this release can be found at www.census.gov/construction/nrs/. EXPLANATORY NOTES These statistics are estimated from sample surveys. They are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated average relative standard errors of the preliminary data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as “2.5 percent (±3.2%) above” appears in the text, this indicates the range (‐0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90‐percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. Changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show irregular movement. It takes 3 months to establish a trend for new houses sold. Preliminary new home sales figures are subject to revision due to the survey methodology and definitions used. The survey is primarily based on a sample of houses selected from building permits. Since a “sale” is defined as a deposit taken or sales agreement signed, this can occur prior to a permit being issued. An estimate of these prior sales is included in the sales figure. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimate of total sales is revised about 3 percent. Changes in sales price data reflect changes in the distribution of houses by region, size, etc., as well as changes in the prices of houses with identical characteristics. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at the Census Bureau’s website. * The 90 percent confidence interval includes zero. In such cases, there is insufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Monday, November 27, 2023",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_263,HUD Awards $25 Million to Public Housing Agencies to Expand More Housing Choices for Families,"WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced $25 million in Housing Mobility-Related Services awards to 7 Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) across the country. These funds are designed to expand housing choices for Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) families with children by increasing access to opportunity neighborhoods with high-performing schools, access to jobs, low crime rates, parks, and other amenities. “Every parent knows the value of providing a safe and secure place for their child to call home. Stability at home helps promote their future success – in school and onwards,” said Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “As HUD works to expand affordable housing and ensure economic mobility is possible for all families, these Housing Mobility-Related Services awards will boost access to housing vouchers for families who need them the most.” The funds for housing mobility-related services, as outlined in the Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO), will enable additional PHAs to administer housing mobility programs. This, in turn, will raise the number of HCV families with children living in neighborhoods characterized by low poverty levels. Richard J. Monocchio, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, made the announcement alongside recipient, Housing Authority of Milwaukee County, in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin. Please see the list of awardees here. “The impact of these funds is tangible – families can more easily move to neighborhoods of their choice and near more opportunity,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, Richard J. Monocchio. “Providing families additional support with their housing search can ultimately lead to better long-term outcomes in employment and education.” This program is based on HUD's Community Choice Demonstration program that builds upon recent research that shows growing up in neighborhoods with lower poverty levels improves children's academic achievement and long-term chances of success and reduces intergenerational poverty. Children who move to low-poverty neighborhoods have also been shown to experience lower rates of hospitalizations, lower hospital spending, and some changes in mental health over the long-term follow-up. Adults given the chance to move to low-poverty neighborhoods experience reductions in obesity and diabetes. While the HCV program currently offers families with vouchers the opportunity to live in a neighborhood of their choice (including low-poverty, opportunity neighborhoods), families with HCVs may continue to encounter barriers to using their vouchers in communities with expanded opportunities. Common barriers include the inability to save enough money for a security deposit, inadequate time to find a unit, landlord unwillingness to rent to voucher holders, or limited awareness of neighborhood amenities, such as the location of high-performing schools. The Housing Choice Voucher Mobility Services Program will support PHAs in addressing barriers to accessing housing choices by offering mobility-related services to increase the number of voucher families with children living in opportunity areas. In addition to offering mobility-related services, PHAs will work together in their regions to adopt administrative policies that further enable housing mobility, increase landlord participation, and reduce barriers for families to move across PHA jurisdictions through portability. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

The Playbook highlights the importance of housing as a key driver of health outcomes and lifts up examples of how U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) programs like Choice Neighborhoods are supporting collaborative efforts to address social determinants of health. In addition, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has also announced a new Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) Health-Related Social Needs (HRSN) Framework. The Framework will help states support clinically appropriate and evidence-based interventions to support housing and nutrition needs for certain Medicaid enrollees, such as by providing medically tailored meals to pregnant and postpartum women, or helping individuals with chronic health conditions who are experiencing homelessness to find and obtain housing. Medicaid services provided under this Framework will complement existing HUD programs, including Housing Choice Vouchers and homelessness assistance grants. Additionally, through the HHS and HUD Housing and Services Resource Center, HUD will continue to provide information to states and communities on how to better leverage Medicaid to cover housing-related HRSNs and coordinate these services with HUD’s programs. As announced earlier this month, HUD and HHS are also selecting up to four states to receive federal technical assistance through the Housing and Services Partnerships Accelerator to help implement Medicaid housing-related HRSNs in coordination with HUD and state and local housing programs. “Housing is foundational to health and lifelong success. Today’s Playbook and suite of actions are important steps forward in our efforts to advance health equity,” said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “HUD continues to work with our partners across the Administration and the country to coordinate the housing, health care, and supportive services that enable Americans to thrive. I encourage HUD grantees and partners to utilize the Playbook to inform their work and engagement.” In summary, the release of the U.S. Playbook and the HRSN Framework demonstrates the Biden-Harris Administration's commitment to advancing health equity by addressing social determinants and creating a more integrated approach to healthcare and social services. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Thursday, November 16, 2023",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_261,"HUD To Preserve and Rehabilitate Affordable Rental Homes in Newport News, VA","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has closed a Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) transaction with the Newport News Redevelopment and Housing Authority (NNRHA) at Orcutt Townhomes. This transaction allows NNRHA to substantially rehabilitate 40 affordable rental homes through a combination of funding from state, local, and federal sources. Through this transaction, NNRHA will be able to ensure that the property is updated and preserved so that it can continue to provide safe and affordable housing to residents for many years to come. Orcutt Townhomes features twenty two-story duplex townhomes and is adjacent to several local amenities, including schools, a grocery store, and other businesses. A new community facility will be built across the street from the property and funded in part through the HUD Choice Neighborhoods Initiative. The property will undergo extensive rehabilitation, including structural upgrades, updating of community amenities, and significant updates to the residents’ homes. Each home will feature new kitchens and appliances, windows, plumbing, and HVAC systems, as well as complete interior and bath refurbishment. Many of the improvements increase energy efficiency, thereby reducing environmental impact and utility costs. The total construction cost for the project is $6.05 million, or approximately $150,000 per home, and is financed through a combination of 9 percent Low Income Housing Tax Credit Equity and funds from the HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME), National Housing Trust Fund, and the Virginia Department of Housing and Community Development. About RAD This year marks the 10th anniversary of the first public housing conversion under the Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) program, which has revitalized nearly 200,000 public housing units and improved the living conditions for more than 500,000 individuals and families. RAD was developed to help address the multi-billion-dollar nationwide backlog of deferred maintenance in the public housing portfolio and to stem the loss of affordable housing that could no longer be kept to decent standards. From the program’s inception through September 1, 2023, RAD has facilitated more than $17.7 billion in capital investment to improve or replace nearly 197,000 deeply rent-assisted homes, most of which house extremely low-income families, seniors, and persons with disabilities. Under RAD, projects funded under the public housing program convert their public housing assistance to project-based Section 8 rental assistance. Residents continue to pay 30 percent of their income towards rent and the housing must continue to serve those with very low and extremely low incomes, as was the case when the property was assisted through the public housing program. Residents must be notified and consulted prior to conversion and are given a right to return to assisted housing post-construction so that they can enjoy these newly preserved and improved apartments and maintain the same fundamental rights they had as public housing residents.

Despite challenges in the housing market, FHA facilitated access to mortgage credit for more than 765,000 homebuyers and homeowners, including more than 33,000 seniors who obtained a Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) during the fiscal year. “Purchasing a home is the cornerstone of the American dream, yet it remains far too out-of-reach for many Americans,” said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “I am pleased to announce that in 2023, we helped hundreds of thousands of people enter the housing market, enabling entirely new futures for them and their families.” Additionally, the annual report shows that FHA maintains a strong, well-capitalized insurance fund. As of September 30, 2023, the MMI Fund maintained an overall capital ratio of 10.51 percent. This represents a slight decrease of only 0.6 percentage points from the previous year. The total capital in the MMI Fund actually increased by $3.6 billion, reaching over $145 billion by the end of the fiscal year, compared to fiscal year 2022. Additionally, FHA’s serious delinquency rate, the percentage of mortgages in its portfolio that are 90 or more days delinquent, was 3.93 percent at the end of fiscal year 2023, similar to the rate prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. “I’m proud that FHA delivered real solutions this past fiscal year, including a reduction in our mortgage insurance premiums and policy and programmatic changes that expanded access to affordable mortgage credit,” said Assistant Secretary for Housing and Federal Housing Commissioner Julia Gordon. “Fiscal year 2023 was a difficult year for homebuyers and the professionals who serve them, and FHA’s exceptional team worked hard to support underserved borrowers and communities as well as our business partners in the mortgage and real estate sector.” The report highlights FHA’s important role in serving populations not adequately served by the private mortgage market. More than 82 percent of FHA purchase mortgage insurance endorsements in fiscal year 2023 went to first-time homebuyers. And as in past years, the share of FHA’s total endorsements that went to borrowers of color significantly exceeded that of other market participants. According to the most recent data available, the percentage of FHA’s volume comprised of mortgages made to Black borrowers was triple the rate of the rest of the market, and for Hispanic borrowers it was double. Finally, according to calendar year 2022 data, close to half of all rural homebuyers who obtained low down-payment mortgages obtained mortgages insured by FHA. The Annual Report to Congress Regarding the Financial Status of the Federal Housing Administration Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund for Fiscal Year 2023, and the fiscal year 2023 actuarial reviews of the Forward and Home Equity Conversion Mortgage portfolios are available on HUD.gov.

WASHINGTON - As part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s Investing in Rural America Tour, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Deputy Secretary Adrianne Todman traveled to Albany, Georgia today to highlight how the Administration's investments in rural affordable housing and the Administration’s actions to promote broadband connectivity amongst HUD-assisted families. HUD's Deputy Secretary announced the department completed a new data sharing agreement with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to support access to the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) by reducing barriers to enrollment. This agreement means that any family receiving rental assistance from HUD can enroll to receive benefits from the ACP with minimal paperwork. Today’s important updates will help facilitate ACP enrollment, connecting families and residents to affordable broadband. The ACP is a FCC program and the nation’s largest broadband affordability program that offers low-income households discounts off the cost of broadband service and connected devices. “For too long the families living in rural America have not felt the benefits of investments in housing and broadband. It is crucial that our rural neighbors also have safe and stable places to call home, with quality, affordable, internet,” said HUD Deputy Secretary Adrianne Todman. “As the Biden-Harris Administration invests in America, our rural communities are a priority. The actions I am announcing today will help ensure that any family that HUD assists can tap into the benefits of an affordable internet connection through the Administration's Affordable Connectivity Plan.” During her visit, Deputy Secretary Todman met with the Mayor of the City of Albany, Georgia, local leaders, housing providers, and community members to discuss rural housing needs and access to quality broadband connections. Additionally, the Deputy Secretary visited a resident whose home was repaired using funds from the HOME Program, HUD’s largest grant program provided to state and local governments to create affordable housing. Deputy Secretary Todman also announced new actions to increase access to quality, affordable, internet. Since Day One, the Biden-Harris administration has made historic investments in rural America, including in economic development and rebuilding infrastructure. Under Bidenomics and the Investing in America agenda, President Biden is growing the economy from the middle-out and bottom-up, because investing in America means investing in all of America – leaving no community behind. “Today’s announcement formalizes a significant and coordinated effort between HUD and the FCC to eliminate barriers to broadband access for millions of housing vulnerable Americans. While I’m proud of our work, HUD-assisted tenants are the ultimate winner because they can now enroll in the Affordable Connectivity Program for which they are eligible with greater ease,” said FCC Commissioner Geoffrey Starks. “I’ve long said that if we are helping a household find housing, we should help ensure that home is connected. By including HUD data in the FCC’s National Verifier, we have streamlined the broadband enrollment process so HUD tenants can get online affordably and quickly.” This announcement builds on Secretary Marcia L. Fudge’s commitment to advance digital equity and ensure families are connected to affordable internet. Earlier this summer, HUD signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the FCC, to encourage enrollment in the ACP for HUD-assisted families. In 2023, HUD has helped organize and facilitate over 45 ACP enrollment events with community partners across the United States. Last month, HUD released a notice in the Federal Register expanding the Department’s Connect HomeUSA initiative. All families receiving rental assistance from HUD are eligible to enroll in the ACP based on their housing assistance.

"Thursday, November 9, 2023",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_257,Federal Housing Administration Proposes Update to Home Equity Conversion Mortgage Assignment Claims Eligibility to Strengthen Market Liquidity,"Proposal posted for feedback will ensure long-term program viability and expanded availability for senior homeowners. WASHINGTON - The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) today announced it has posted for industry feedback a proposed update to its Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) assignment claims eligibility policy. The proposal enables certain categories of due and payable HECMs that were previously ineligible for assignment to be assigned to HUD, enabling servicers to obtain earlier resolution of these loans through HUD’s assignment claims process. This change will support servicer liquidity and strengthen the HECM market for senior homeowners who use a HECM to age in place. “At HUD, Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECM) are one of our most impactful tools to support seniors,” said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “I am pleased that our FHA team is expanding the availability of this program so everyone can age in place with dignity.” Under current program requirements, mortgage servicers can assign a HECM to HUD when the mortgage reaches 98 percent of the Maximum Claim Amount and there is an eligible borrower or non-borrowing spouse residing in the property. Once the mortgage is assigned to HUD and placed in HUD’s Secretary-held portfolio, FHA disburses claim funds to the mortgage servicer and assumes responsibility for servicing the mortgage. The assignment option reduces costly servicing expenses and allows mortgage servicers to obtain proceeds faster than otherwise possible through other measures. “Today’s proposal is the latest in the series of measures we’ve taken throughout this year to facilitate greater liquidity and stability in the HECM market,” said Assistant Secretary for Housing and Federal Housing Commissioner Julia Gordon. “Preserving HECM as an option for seniors who have financial needs but want to age in place is a high priority for FHA.” HECMs deemed due and payable have been ineligible for assignment to HUD. The proposal posted today would permit servicers to assign a HECM to HUD when the mortgage becomes due and payable due to the death of all borrowers and all eligible or ineligible non-borrowing spouses. As a result, servicers no longer will have responsibility for servicing these loans and can receive claim payments upon assignment of these mortgages. FHA is seeking industry feedback on its proposal through December 11, 2023. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Wednesday, November 8, 2023",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_256,HUD Releases $50 Million to Address Youth Homelessness & New Assistance to Improve Housing Placements for People Experiencing Homelessness and Resolve Encampments,"WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is announcing new resources, technical assistance, and regulatory flexibilities to support their efforts to address homelessness, including among youth, people in unsheltered settings, and people in rural areas. HUD is making $50 million in Youth Homelessness System Improvement (YHSI) grants funding available to communities nationwide. The grants will focus on systemic change to either improve or create response systems for youth at risk of or experiencing homelessness by funding projects that create and build capacity for Youth Action Boards; establish regional committees on youth homelessness to direct efforts across multiple systems including education, justice, and child welfare; collect and use data on at-risk youth and youth experiencing homelessness; develop strong leaders within a community; and improve the coordination, communication, operation, and administration of homeless assistance projects to better serve youth, including prevention and diversion strategies. Read HUD’s Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) here. “HUD knows that ending homelessness requires commitment from many partners. Through HUD funding and technical assistance, HUD is cutting some of the red tape to help communities make tangible plans and take actionable steps to address homelessness among youth, people in unsheltered settings and in rural areas,” said Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “The Biden-Harris Administration is taking a whole-of-government approach toward ending homelessness. We encourage our state and local partners to join us in this critical effort and leverage unprecedented levels of federal resources and flexibilities available to address this crisis.” Additionally, HUD is engaged in a multi-pronged technical assistance strategy to assist 62 Continuum of Care (CoC) communities and 139 Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) that received resources to address rural and unsheltered homelessness. The technical assistance will improve coordination of programs and services, support people with lived experience to serve in advisory roles, improve their engagement of people in unsheltered and rural settings, improve connections to permanent housing with supportive and health services. Find more information here. To further encourage and support PHAs to assist people experiencing homelessness, HUD issued a letter to PHAs encouraging them to take full advantage of HUD resources and regulatory flexibilities to support their work to address homelessness. Find the letter here. While other HUD and federal funds focus on specific housing and service needs of youth experiencing or at risk of homelessness, Youth Homelessness System Improvement (YHSI) grants will help communities build a strong, resilient, and equitable homelessness response system that is less siloed and will break down barriers for youth in crisis. Recognizing that systemic change is often larger than one Continuum of Care, HUD is opening this $50 million notice of funding opportunity to include additional points for statewide or cross-community project proposals in order to emphasize the need for coordination across communities. The maximum amount of funding for each award type will be doubled for applications that cover geographic areas in 2 or more Continuums of Care (CoCs), or if the CoC covers the entire geography of the state. YHSI Grants will add to the suite of HUD initiatives that support young people in gaining and maintaining stable housing including the Youth Homelessness Demonstration Program (YHDP), the Foster Youth to Independence (FYI) Initiative, and the Family Unification Program (FUP). In 2023, HUD awarded 62 communities with a package of resources to address homelessness among people in unsheltered settings and in rural areas. This package includes $486 million in grants to 62 Continuums of Care (CoCs) to fund permanent housing programs, homeless outreach and housing navigation, housing-related supportive services, data improvements, and system coordination as well as $45 million to allocate over 3,300 Stability Vouchers to 135 public housing agencies who are partnering with the 62 CoCs. Stability Vouchers can serve people experiencing or at-risk of homelessness, including people fleeing or attempting to flee domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or human trafficking. The technical assistance strategy released today supports this funding by providing assistance, including: Housing Central Command: A select number of communities will be provided intensive support to implement Housing Central Command, an approach that uses emergency management structure and processes to resolve homeless encampments. Direct and Peer-to-Peer Technical Assistance for Grantee Communities Addressing Unsheltered Homelessness: All communities that received grants and vouchers to address unsheltered homelessness will receive a robust package of direct technical assistance, monthly community-to-community knowledge and practice exchange convenings, and trainings and expertise around specific topics. Technical Assistance on Use of Stability Vouchers to Assist People Experiencing Homelessness: HUD will provide the 135 PHAs and their partners with a series of webinars to support the use of Stability Vouchers to assist people experiencing homelessness. Tailored and Direct Technical Assistance to Grantees Communities Addressing Rural Homelessness Federal Interagency Support with the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH) to ensure that all grantee communities are leveraging other federal programs and resources to support their efforts. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

WASHINGTON - Jean Lin Pao, the Director of the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) was named the winner of a 2023 Presidential Rank Award (PRA) for Distinguished Executive, as chosen by President Joe Biden. The PRAs are one of the most prestigious awards in the career civil service, recognizing the important contributions of public servants across the federal government. For its performance in contracting with small businesses in FY 2022, HUD earned an annual procurement scorecard rating of “A+,” the highest grade from the Small Business Administration (SBA). Only 1 percent of career members of the Senior Executive Service receive the Distinguished Executive rank, which recognizes extraordinary achievement. “I’m honored to serve alongside HUD’s career civil servants, who are among the finest in the country,” said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “All of us at HUD are proud of Director Pao's accomplishments and all she does to ensure HUD empowers small and disadvantaged businesses to be active partners in our work.” In her role, Director Pao serves as the principal advocate for small businesses and ensures small business concerns have maximum practicable opportunities in federal contracting, a $650 billion annual federal enterprise. Supporting the Secretary and Deputy Secretary, she directs, plans, and manages HUD’s small business programs, which provide businesses with universal access to HUD’s $1.5 billion in annual contracting opportunities. Through her exceptional record of continuous improvement and innovation, Director Pao transformed the way HUD OSDBU leads outreach, education, and advocacy efforts nationally to increase small business utilization in federal contracting and effectively implemented new federal directives on advancing equity in federal procurement. “I am sincerely humbled by this recognition of the work my team and I do to make the Department better each and every day,” said Director Pao. “From ensuring that small, small disadvantaged, women-, HUBZone, and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses are empowered, to promoting diversity in government procurement, OSDBU is always focused on fairness, opportunity, and sustainable entrepreneurship.” Director Pao is an exemplary leader for small business advocacy efforts. Under her leadership since Fiscal Year (FY) 2017, OSDBU helped HUD award over $3.3 billion to small businesses through competitive procurements and significant savings to the nation. Her efforts also supported the implementation of federal-wide public policies for small business inclusion and supplier diversity in government procurement. Director Pao and her team also received the Partnership for Public Service’s 2020 Outstanding Alumni Award for OSDBU’s outreach efforts to increase federal contracting with small businesses. The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 established the Presidential Rank Awards Program to recognize a select group of career members of the Senior Executive Service (SES) for exceptional performance over an extended period of time. Later, the Rank Award statute was amended to extend eligibility to senior career employees with a sustained record of exceptional professional, technical, and/or scientific achievement recognized on a national or international level. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Wednesday, November 8, 2023",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_254,"Survey Finds HUD Employees Feeling Safer, More Empowered, and Valued in 2023","2023 Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey also finds increases in HUD workforce’s dedication to the common good, leadership’s commitment to diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility. WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today released the results of the 2023 Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS), which found that in general, HUD employees feel more protected in their workplace, empowered, and valued in their roles than before. The FEVS, which is the largest annual survey of government employees in the world, tracks how federal employees view their current work environment, including workforce management, policies, and new initiatives. The survey is an unmatched government data asset that collects employee feedback from more than 80 executive agencies to assist in driving improvement and supporting the workforce to serve the American people. “As we entered 2023, I made a commitment to making HUD easier to navigate for those we serve – and that includes our own employees,” said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “Today’s results show us that we have made serious progress in our efforts to make sure HUD employees feel valued, safe, and included on our team while also ensuring accessibility and diversity in the workplace.” Some of the responses that saw the highest positive increases and the most positive responses overall included: “Employees are protected from health and safety hazards on the job.” “I can influence decisions in my work unit.” “Management involves employees in decisions that affect their work.” “It is important to me that my work contribute to the common good.” “Employees in my work unit meet the needs of our customers.” “Public service is a noble calling; and HUD's mission to create strong, sustainable, and inclusive communities is critical,” said HUD Deputy Secretary Adrianne Todman. “It is so important that HUD's employees feel engaged and supported, and I am pleased that our efforts are having an impact as we seek to build a better HUD from the inside out.” At HUD and across the federal government, three major increases display the Department’s progress on employee engagement, diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility, and each employee’s satisfaction in their job: The Employee Engagement Index score, which increased to HUD’s highest-ever score – 77 percent positive overall – saw positive increases in the integrity of leadership, relationships between worker and supervisor, and employees’ feelings of motivation and competency. HUD’s Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility score increased to 75 percent, including a notable 3.1-point increase in accessibility – developing facilities, communications, programs, and services so that all employees, including those with disabilities, can fully and independently use them. The Global Satisfaction Index score, which measures employee satisfaction overall, increased to 72 percent. This includes increases in satisfaction of one’s job, pay, organization, and a 3.6-point increase in employees’ recommendation of HUD as a good place to work. Making HUD easier to navigate remains a leading priority of Secretary Fudge and the Biden-Harris Administration, from studying how to reduce administrative burden to ensuring FHA resources are accessible to borrowers with limited English proficiency. This focus is not only external, but internal as well, as Secretary Fudge seeks to build an enriching, inclusive, and creative work environment within the Department. The results shown today in the full report reflect this adherence to accessibility, inclusion, and empowerment. HUD’s Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer provides support to employees under the mantra: “You Spoke, We Listened, This Happened!” Through events like HUD’s All-Staff Town Halls and Leadership Conference, HUD leaders work to empower employees with the resources to succeed, provide insight for management and policymaking, and infuse the values of diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility into the Department’s work.

WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has announced the City of Madison Community Development Authority (CDA) in Madison, Wisconsin will be the partnering public housing agency for the 11th annual Innovation in Affordable Housing (IAH) Student Design and Planning Competition. Each year, HUD's Innovation in Affordable Housing competition invites graduate students enrolled in accredited educational institutions in the United States to form multi-disciplinary teams to respond to an existing affordable housing design and planning issue. The competition requires teams composed of graduate students in architecture, planning and policy, finance, and other areas to address social, economic, environmental, design, financial, and construction issues in addition to an affordable housing design challenge. “Today’s students are more creative than ever,” said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “Through this competition, we’re channeling their ingenuity to build quality, safe, and resilient affordable housing for millions of Wisconsin families. I’m pleased by my team’s commitment to innovative new ways to advance housing for those we serve.” The Madison CDA currently owns a 169-unit public housing building on 7-acre site. They are considering demolishing the current building and replacing it with multiple newly constructed buildings. This process will include repositioning the 169 public housing units through a Section 18 or RAD/Section 18 blend application. Madison CDA’s primary goal is to create a moderately dense and sustainable mixed-income community that includes affordable and workforce housing. To accomplish this goal, student teams will develop a project that includes both multifamily rental developments and affordable homeownership opportunities. Madison CDA has also requested that teams reconnect the site to the surrounding neighborhood. After the submission of initial applications in January 2024, a jury of five industry subject matter experts will select four student team finalists to advance to the second round of the competition. These finalist teams will visit the site in Madison to further refine their submissions. On April 18th, 2024, the four finalist student teams will present their final projects to a jury of practitioners at HUD Headquarters in Washington, D.C. The winning team will be awarded $20,000, and the runner-up team will receive a $10,000 award. The two remaining finalist teams will each receive $5,000. By initiating and funding this competition, HUD hopes to inspire and support aspiring members of fields such as architecture, planning, policy, and finance in advancing affordable and sustainable housing for low- and moderate-income Americans. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

WASHINGTON - The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) today announced it is extending its existing disaster-related foreclosure moratorium in Maui County, HI, through May 6, 2024, for borrowers with FHA-insured single-family mortgages, including seniors with Home Equity Conversion Mortgages. This extension provides additional time for borrowers in the process of recovering from the unprecedented challenges of the catastrophic Maui wildfires to consult with mortgage servicers and housing counselors and to access federal, state, and local housing resources without also having to contend with the burden of an impending foreclosure action. “When I visited Maui in September, I saw firsthand the damage inflicted by the devastating wildfires. The people of Maui are resilient, but they will need support for years to come to rebuild and recover,” said HUD Deputy Secretary Adrianne Todman. “With today’s announcement, we are assuring homeowners in Maui that HUD is here to support them as they navigate next steps with their family.” FHA implemented an automatic 90-day foreclosure moratorium that required mortgage servicers to halt the initiation or completion of all foreclosure actions in Maui County on August 10, 2023, when the disaster occurred. The moratorium was originally set to expire on November 8, 2023. In addition to extending the foreclosure moratorium through May 6, 2024, FHA is also extending the deadline dates for servicers to perform certain legal actions related to foreclosure for an additional 180 days following the end of the foreclosure moratorium. “We remain committed to doing everything we can to help the residents of Maui as they begin to rebuild their homes and lives,” said Federal Housing Commissioner Julia R. Gordon. “The last thing any FHA borrower there should have to worry about right now is foreclosure.” Borrowers in Maui County with FHA-insured mortgages impacted by the Maui wildfires should contact their mortgage or loan servicer immediately for assistance. Borrowers can also obtain additional assistance in the following ways: Visit the FHA Disaster Relief site or call the FHA Resource Center at 1-800-304-9320 to learn more about disaster relief options. Contact a HUD-approved housing counseling agency. These agencies have counselors available to assist those impacted by natural disasters in determining assistance needs and identifying available resources. Homeowners can find a HUD-approved housing counseling agency online or use HUD’s telephone look-up tool by calling (800) 569-4287. The telephone look-up tool includes access to information in more than 250 different languages. Borrowers do not have to have an FHA-insured mortgage to meet with a HUD-approved housing counseling agency. There is never a fee for foreclosure prevention counseling. For borrowers whose homes are destroyed or damaged to an extent that requires reconstruction or complete replacement, contact an FHA-approved lender about FHA’s Section 203(h) program. This program provides 100 percent financing for eligible homeowners to rebuild their home or purchase a new one. For borrowers seeking to purchase and/or repair a home that has been damaged, contact an FHA-approved lender about FHA's Section 203(k) loan program. This program allows individuals to finance the purchase or refinance of a house, as well as the costs of repair or renovation, through a single mortgage. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

WASHINGTON - The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) today announced the publication of updated appraisal requirements for the valuation of manufactured homes certified under Fannie Mae’s MH AdvantageTM and Freddie Mac’s CHOICEHome® programs. Federal Housing Commissioner Julia Gordon made the announcement this morning at the Manufactured Housing Institute’s National Communities Conference Fall Leadership Forum in Chicago, IL. The updates align FHA appraisal requirements with those of other industry participants and will improve the valuation of these homes for borrowers seeking FHA-insured mortgages. These changes also contribute to FHA’s efforts to increase the availability and affordability of manufactured housing as part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s Housing Supply Action Plan. “Increasing the supply of affordable homes in this country will require us to use every tool available to us. That includes innovative solutions like manufactured housing,” said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “The critical step we're taking today ensures HUD is in alignment with our industry partners, and it will make more quality affordable housing available to people across the country.” “Updating FHA appraisal requirements to align with the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac certification programs supports our comprehensive efforts to increase both the supply and affordability of manufactured homes,” said Federal Housing Commissioner Julia R. Gordon. “Today, we’ve removed another roadblock limiting the effectiveness of FHA programs in serving buyers of these manufactured homes. We hope it will facilitate the continued growth and adoption of this important source of affordable and energy-efficient housing.” Effective immediately, FHA’s updated policy for the valuation of manufactured homes certified under the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac programs requires appraisers to use the most appropriate site-built-home comparable sales when there are less than two comparable sales of these certified manufactured homes available. Manufactured homes certified under the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac programs, also known as CrossMods, include design features that make them nearly indistinguishable from many site-built homes and address regulatory barriers in effect in some jurisdictions that have historically restricted the placement of manufactured homes. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

WASHINGTON - The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) today announced it has posted for industry feedback a set of proposed policy updates to its Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) program designed to improve program stability and to respond to changing market conditions. These measures reaffirm FHA’s commitment to the future success of this important program and the senior citizen population it is designed to serve. FHA is seeking feedback on the policy updates contained in its draft Mortgagee Letter through November 7, 2023. “At HUD, we’re constantly working to enhance, update, and streamline our key programs to make them accessible and easy to navigate for those we serve,” said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “We urge the public to provide us feedback on our new proposed changes to Home Equity Conversion Mortgages, so we can best benefit seniors, their families, and lenders.” “The HECM program remains one of the cornerstone programs on the market to help seniors who want to stay in their own homes as they age,” said Federal Housing Commissioner Julia R. Gordon. “These proposals benefit seniors with HECM mortgages as well as their families, and they also facilitate participation in the program by HECM lenders.” The proposed updates posted today would streamline certain requirements and reduce operational challenges associated with servicing a HECM portfolio. Key changes include: Allowing mortgage servicers to contact borrowers by phone to verify occupancy for the program’s required annual occupancy certification; Allowing outstanding homeowner’s association dues to be included in the calculation of a repayment plan for borrowers who are behind on their HECM financial obligations; Expanding the ability of mortgage servicers to work with borrowers who are behind on their property tax or hazard insurance by an amount up to $5,000 without calling the mortgage due and payable; Allowing mortgage servicers to assign a HECM to HUD after the servicer has funded a cure for a borrower’s delinquent financial obligations so long as the borrower has made all property charge payments for one year and all other assignment eligibility criteria are met; Streamlining requirements for executing alternatives to foreclosure and updating existing incentive payments for successful completion of loss mitigation options; and Providing a new incentive payment to mortgage servicers for completing these alternatives. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Tuesday, October 31, 2023",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_248,Federal Housing Administration Publishes Comprehensive Guidance for the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage Program,"WASHINGTON - The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) today announced the publication of consolidated and comprehensive policies for its Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) program, and the inclusion of these policies in the Single-Family Housing Policy Handbook 4000.1. For the first time ever, all HECM program requirements will be available in a single place. Today’s publication eliminates more than one hundred individual policy documents associated with the HECM program. This consolidation into a single handbook will strengthen the understanding and implementation of the program by lenders and servicers, enhancing their ability to actively engage with the more than 60,000 senior homeowners who choose to obtain a HECM to age in place in their own homes each year. “Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECM) are one of the strongest tools we have to ensure thousands of seniors can age in place,” said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “This new guidance will give people one single place to easily access the information needed to obtain and maintain a HECM.” With the incorporation of the new HECM sections into the Single Family Handbook, FHA has completed its multi-year effort to deliver a consolidated, comprehensive, and authoritative source of Single Family policy for lenders, servicers, and other FHA program participants. The new sections of the Single Family Handbook governing the HECM program include: Section II.B, covering FHA policy for the origination through post-closing and endorsement of HECMs; and Section III.B, covering FHA policy for the servicing of HECMs and loss mitigation options to assist HECM borrowers who are behind on their HECM mortgage obligations. “HECM mortgages are an important tool to help senior homeowners age with security and dignity in their own homes,” said Assistant Secretary for Housing and Federal Housing Commissioner Julia Gordon. “The completion of the HECM sections of our Single Family Handbook reinforces FHA’s commitment to the HECM program and is part of a larger effort to retool the program for long-term success.” Additional resources, including updated model documents, Frequently Asked Questions, training, and the online version of the full Single Family Handbook with the new HECM sections, will be available soon. “This body of work follows extensive engagement and feedback from HECM lenders, servicers, consumer advocates, and other housing industry participants over the last two years – engagement that was instrumental in helping us move this initiative to completion,” said Deputy Assistant Secretary for Single Family Housing Sarah Edelman. “The newly consolidated HECM single-source handbook sections have comprehensive and updated language that delivers greater clarity about our existing policies and establishes a more flexible framework for us to implement future policy changes.” ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Monday, October 30, 2023",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_247,HUD Proposes Rule to Remove Criminal Conviction Restrictions for Fair Housing Testers,"WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the Federal Register that would eliminate the agency’s restrictions on the use of fair housing testers with prior felony convictions or certain other convictions by Fair Housing Initiatives Program (FHIP) grantees and Fair Housing Assistance Program (FHAP) agencies. Fair housing testers provide invaluable support to HUD and HUD’s fair housing partners by taking part in housing transactions to screen for discrimination. “We trust fair housing testers to identify bias and discrimination in housing so we can fulfill our mission to root it out. Through this new rule, we can ensure people with criminal records who want to participate in this important work aren't facing unnecessary barriers,” said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “People reentering society, and those with criminal records, deserve a fair shot at a second chance. This rule helps us get there.” This proposed rule aligns with HUD Secretary Marcia Fudge’s April 12, 2022 Memorandum, “Eliminating Barriers That May Unnecessarily Prevent Individuals with Criminal Histories from Participating in HUD Programs.” Additionally, it would make HUD’s programs as inclusive as possible for people with criminal records and ensure that FHIP and FHAP funded entities are able to fully investigate criminal background screening policies that are potentially discriminatory under federal civil rights laws by using testers with actual criminal backgrounds. “This proposed rule is consistent with the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to eliminating barriers to reentry and expanding avenues for employment,” said Demetria L. McCain, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. “It rolls back unnecessary rules imposed on our fair housing partners and allows them to structure their fair housing tests in the most appropriate ways while recognizing the many forms of discrimination in our country’s housing market.” HUD seeks public comment on this proposed rule and invites all interested parties and members of the public to submit their views, comments, and recommendations for improvement on this proposal. Comments may be submitted electronically by December 29 through www.regulations.gov or through the methods described in the proposed rule. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Friday, October 27, 2023",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_246,Biden-Harris Administration Encourages Communities and Developers to Explore More Commercial to Residential Conversions,"WASHINGTON – Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Biden-Harris Administration announced important updates that will help bolster our nation’s housing supply and improve housing affordability. The White House released a guidebook, developed in partnership with HUD and other federal agencies, that will help communities and housing providers identify federal resources to finance the conversion of commercial properties to residential uses and mixed-use development. See today’s White House fact sheet here. As part of this announcement, HUD is releasing an updated notice on how its Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funding, $10 billion of which has been allocated during this Administration, can be used to boost housing supply – including acquisition, rehabilitation, and commercial-to-residential conversions. This notice is the latest update on how to use CDBG resources to support the development of affordable housing. States and localities can also access up to five times their annual CDBG allocation in low-cost loan guarantees to fund projects such as the conversion of properties to housing or mixed-use development. “Addressing the affordable housing crisis requires an all-of-the-above approach,” said Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “The White House guidebook on commercial-to-residential conversions and the updated CDBG notice are just a few of the steps that HUD is taking to help our state and local partners to boost supply.” In addition, HUD recently released an issue of Evidence Matters focused on office-to-residential conversions, which provides a research overview of the issues motivating the surge in interest in conversions and highlights local examples of conversion projects. HUD is providing additional research funding to develop case studies that can serve as road maps for localities interested in pursuing conversion projects. The Notice of Funding Opportunity recently closed, and awards will be made soon. “HUD is hard at work listening to stakeholders and exploring solutions that will help expand and preserve housing supply in the country,” said Deputy Secretary Adrianne Todman. “With a shortage of millions of homes nationwide, we need to utilize every resource at our disposal to increase housing supply.” These actions build off the significant progress the Administration and HUD have already made in implementing President Biden’s Housing Supply Action Plan that details the concrete steps the Administration is taking to ease the burden of housing costs for households by boosting supply. Agencies across the government have taken action to incentivize state and local zoning reforms, pilot new forms of financing, expand and improve existing forms of financing, support innovation in housing production, and much more. The CDBG notice published today provides updated and expanded guidance on a wide range of housing-related activities that may be funded through the CDBG program – including acquisition, adaptive reuse, rehabilitation, reconstruction, housing counseling, and fair housing planning activities. The notice also clarifies that manufactured housing units that are part of the community’s permanent housing stock are eligible for acquisition or direct homeownership assistance through the CDBG program. Additionally, the notice highlights the importance of planning in protecting and preserving housing and community resilience and provides guidance on how CDBG can support energy and climate-related rehabilitation and tornado safe homes and public facilities. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

Gordon today joined the leadership of National Church Residences, the largest nationwide non-profit organization providing affordable senior housing, and state and local dignitaries at a ribbon-cutting ceremony celebrating the opening of Salem Village in Columbus, OH, and its 76 new affordable rental homes for low-income seniors. Assistant Secretary Gordon highlighted the importance of HUD’s partnership with National Church Residences and other nonprofit housing providers across the country as a critical component of the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to increasing the supply and affordability of rental housing for low-income seniors and other vulnerable populations. “Our goal is to forge deep and meaningful relationships with those who, like National Church Residences, are at the forefront of providing safe, stable, and affordable housing to those we collectively serve,” said Assistant Secretary Gordon. “The opening of Salem Village is just one of the examples of how our long-standing partnership with National Church Residences can positively impact the lives of low-income seniors who need both affordable housing and the supportive services to live independently.” The development of Salem Village was financed in part by a $4.9 million grant awarded in 2020 by HUD under its Multifamily Section 202 Capital Advance and Project-based Rental Assistance programs. In addition, on October 3rd, HUD awarded more than $9 million in Section 202 Capital Advance and ongoing Project-based Rental Assistance grants supporting affordable rental homes at a new National Church Residences property for seniors to be built in Columbus, OH. Since 2020, HUD has awarded more than $30 million in grant awards to National Church Residences to facilitate the creation or rehabilitation of affordable rental homes for low-income seniors. As of October 2023, HUD provides project-based rental assistance for more than 16,000 affordable rental homes on properties owned by National Church Residences. About HUD’s Section 202 Program Section 202 grants provide very low-income elderly persons 62 years of age or older with the opportunity to live independently in an environment that provides support services, such as nutrition, transportation, continuing education, and/or health-related services, to meet their unique needs. Section 202 program eligibility requires residents to be very low-income or earn less than 50 percent of the area median income. Most households in the Section 202 program earn less than 30 percent of the median for their area. About National Church Residences Originating from a Christian commitment of service, National Church Residences provides an array of health care services and a variety of housing options to 46,000 seniors. The nonprofit organization is driven by a vision to scale for mission impact by advancing better living for 100,000 seniors by 2030, wherever they call home. With more than 360 communities across the United States, it is the nation’s largest nonprofit provider of affordable senior housing and the largest manager of service coordinators.

"Wednesday, October 25, 2023",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_244,HUD and Census Bureau Report New Residential Sales in September 2023,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Census Bureau jointly announced the following new residential sales statistics for September 2023: New Home Sales Sales of new single‐family houses in September 2023 were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 795,000, according to estimates released jointly today by the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. This is 12.3 percent (±16.6 percent)* above the revised August rate of 676,000, and is 33.9 percent (±22.9 percent)* above the September 2022 estimate of 567,000. Sales Price The median sales price of new houses sold in September 2023 was $418,800. The average sales price was $503,900. For Sale Inventory and Months’ Supply The seasonally‐adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of September was 435,000. This represents a supply of 6.9 months at the current sales rate. The October report is scheduled for release on November 27, 2023. View the full schedule in the Economic Briefing Room: www.census.gov/economic-indicators/. The full text and tables for this release can be found at www.census.gov/construction/nrs/. EXPLANATORY NOTES These statistics are estimated from sample surveys. They are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated average relative standard errors of the preliminary data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as “2.5 percent (±3.2%) above” appears in the text, this indicates the range (‐0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90‐percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. Changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show irregular movement. It takes 3 months to establish a trend for new houses sold. Preliminary new home sales figures are subject to revision due to the survey methodology and definitions used. The survey is primarily based on a sample of houses selected from building permits. Since a “sale” is defined as a deposit taken or sales agreement signed, this can occur prior to a permit being issued. An estimate of these prior sales is included in the sales figure. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimate of total sales is revised about 3 percent. Changes in sales price data reflect changes in the distribution of houses by region, size, etc., as well as changes in the prices of houses with identical characteristics. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at the Census Bureau’s website. * The 90 percent confidence interval includes zero. In such cases, there is insufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero. Notice of Revision: With this release, seasonally adjusted estimates of housing units sold, housing units for sale, and the months' supply of new housing have been revised back to January 2018. All revised estimates are available on the Census Bureau website. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Tuesday, October 24, 2023",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_243,HUD Earns Institutional Energy Management Award from the Association of Energy Engineers,"HUD's energy branch was recognized by the Association of Energy Engineers for remarkable initiatives in energy efficiency and sustainability for public housing authorities WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) Office of Public Housing, Energy Branch received an international award for the Institutional Energy Management from the Association of Energy Engineers (AEE). The prestigious award is granted to organizations that have achieved national and international prominence in promoting the practices and principles of energy engineering and energy management. During the 2023 AEE World Energy Conference and Expo in Orlando, FL, HUD's Energy Director, Dr. Charles Marshall, and Kevin Gallagher, the division's Director of Financial Management, received the award. “HUD is honored to receive the Association of Energy Engineers’ 2023 Institutional Energy Management Award for our dedication and performance when it comes to energy,” said Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “We are grateful for the acknowledgement of our efforts, and we look forward to continuing to partner with the energy industry.” The Energy Branch manages four programs and provides other technical assistance to improve the capacity of public housing authorities (PHAs) to improve energy and water efficiency, implement renewable energy, and reduce carbon emissions. Programs include the energy performance contract (EPC), the rate reduction incentive (RRI), the Small Rural Frozen Rolling Base (SRFRB), and the Utility Partnership Program (UPP). The Energy Performance Contract (EPC) allows housing authorities to enter a contract with a 3rd party to finance investment for up to 20 years. The UPP allows housing authorities to finance projects for up to 20 years through a utility provider. The EPC program, the oldest program over 30 years old, provides approximately $302M per year in savings to finance infrastructure investment in PHAs. Working with the Special Applications Center and the Office of Housing Investment, guidance was developed to assist housing authorities to dispose or demolish units associated with the EPCs to support the remaining units in the EPCs through the term of the contract. The Energy Branch has also produced and published on the internet short videos providing instructions on using the EPC programs. The Rate Reduction Incentive (RRI) allows housing authorities to retain 50-100% of the savings from significant actions to reduce utility rates including investment in renewable energy. In addition, the RRI program has grown 68% since 2020 providing over $86M in savings benefits to housing authorities in 2023. Guidance has been updated and published to provide support. The updated RRI guidance provides several improvements in the use of the program including more concise instructions and clearer guidance for housing authorities to implement power purchase agreements and other renewable energy contracting mechanisms. The Energy Branch has also produced and published on the internet short videos providing instructions on using RRI programs. The Small Rural Frozen Rolling Base (SRFRB) implemented in 2021 allows PHAs to retain 100% savings for up to 20 years. The SRFRB program provides opportunities for 1,600+ small and rural housing authorities throughout the U.S. and its territories. The program has grown 32% over the last three years as more technical assistance is being developed for the small and rural housing authorities with over a $1M being paid to small and rural housing authorities. Guidance has been updated and published to provide support. Other activities include: In 2021, the Energy Branch sponsored an industry day where ESCOs, housing authorities, utility companies, consultants, and renewable energy specialists came together to discuss opportunities to improve utility programs for public housing authorities. Other videos have been produced in partnership with the U.S. Department of Energy to provide guidance on implementing energy conservation measures like energy efficient lighting and HVAC upgrades. The Energy Branch continues to provide opportunities for PHA’s to increase participation in programs that help increase investment in energy and water efficiency and clean energy through renewable programs.

"Tuesday, October 24, 2023",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_242,"HUD Expands More Housing Choices to a Total of 800,000 Households with Rental Assistance","WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced action that will cover expanded housing and neighborhood choices for more than 800,000 total households using Housing Choice Vouchers to find and secure affordable housing. Today’s action requires an additional 41 metropolitan areas that cover more than 440,000 housing vouchers to use Small Area Fair Market Rents (SAFMR) under HUD’s 2016 Small Area Fair Market Rent Final Rule, joining 24 metropolitan areas that covered almost 370,000 vouchers and bringing the total number of metropolitan areas covered by the rule to 65 covering more than 800,000 households (or 45% of families in the Housing Choice Voucher program). This action ensures that a portion of units in every neighborhood are affordable to tenants renting with a voucher, including higher-rent neighborhoods with high performing schools and other life-enriching opportunities. Find the notice, pending publication in the Federal Register, linked here. Small Area Fair Market Rents allow Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) to set the maximum rent that housing vouchers will cover at the ZIP code level instead of the entire metropolitan area. This policy allows voucher payments that more accurately reflect the local market and enable voucher holders to choose from a wider range of neighborhoods that suit their and their family's preferences and meet their needs, at no additional cost to them. “Today’s action helps realize a dream that has been deferred for too long. By expanding the housing choices of 800,000 households of modest means, HUD is increasing opportunities and working to break down longstanding, harmful systems of segregation,” said Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “While the housing crisis remains a challenge, implementing innovative solutions is crucial and will foster a more sustainable future within our communities.” Increasing choice for households who rely on Housing Choice Vouchers can positively impact families’ health and well-being. For instance, when children in low-income families grow up in low-poverty, well-resourced neighborhoods, they are much more likely to attend college and earn more as young adults. And there's evidence that PHAs that have used SAFMRs in the past expand housing choices for families, allowing them to use their vouchers in neighborhoods with lower poverty rates and better performing schools. “HUD is opening doors for hardworking people of modest incomes who rely on our assistance,” said Richard J. Monocchio, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing. “This is the largest expansion of voucher choice ever and HUD looks forward to working with public housing authorities to implement a change that will be life changing for their residents. In addition to required metropolitan areas, HUD encourages all public housing authorities to review the available SAFMRs for use and implementation.” While 65 metropolitan areas will be required to use Small Area Fair Market Rents to calculate rental assistance, HUD calculates and publishes Small Area Fair Market Rents for all metropolitan areas, which Public Housing Agencies can voluntarily adopt. Under the 2016 rule, PHAs in 24 metropolitan areas were required to use SAFMRs to administer vouchers. Since then, additional PHAs have voluntarily adopted SAFMRs or are utilizing SAFMRs as exception payment standards to increase neighborhood choice for their voucher families. “This action benefits families and communities by giving families more choices and supporting more inclusive communities,” said Solomon Greene, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research. “A growing body of research shows that neighborhoods have a strong impact on families’ health, economic opportunity, and well-being. We know that neighborhoods matter for upward mobility, and this announcement helps ensure that more families can use their vouchers in neighborhoods that meet their families’ needs.” Expanding the use of Small Area Fair Market Rents is a key step for HUD in its continued work to expand choices and opportunities for families and undoing years of harmful racial and economic segregation. “With this action HUD is taking an additional step to address decades of harmful economic and racial segregation,” said Demetria McCain, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. “We are not only actualizing HUD’s mission to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all, but we’re helping families realize their goals by increasing choice and breaking down barriers to low poverty well-resourced communities.” To ensure that Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) have sufficient time to prepare to use Small Area Fair Market Rents, the agencies within the 41 new metropolitan areas will have 15 months to implement the changes. The notice is effective October 1, 2024; PHAs will have until January 1, 2025 to align their payment standards with the notice. Households that use Housing Choice Vouchers for rental assistance can start speaking to their Public Housing agencies housing specialists now to inquire how this change could impact them.

"Monday, October 23, 2023",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_241,HUD Announces ConnectHomeUSA Virtual Summit to Bridge the Digital Divide for HUD-Assisted Families,"WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced that Secretary Marcia L. Fudge will provide remarks at the 2023 ConnectHomeUSA (CHUSA) Virtual Summit for CHUSA communities, Public Housing Agencies (PHAs), Tribes/Tribally Designated Housing Entities (TDHEs), Multifamily housing providers, public-private stakeholders, and anyone interested in promoting digital inclusion in their community, October 24 – 26, 2023. The 3-day virtual summit features training webinars, roundtable discussions, and networking opportunities for interested parties to promote digital inclusion for American families. In addition, the sessions will provide information and tips to help communities tap into resources for affordable devices, connectivity, and training. FCC Commissioner Geoffrey Starks will also provide remarks. Interested parties can register here. To build on Secretary Marcia L. Fudge’s commitment to advance digital equity and ensure families are connected to affordable internet, HUD aims to build awareness of the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP). The ACP is a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) program and the nation’s largest broadband affordability program that offers low-income households discounts off the cost of broadband service and connected devices. HUD-assisted residents are eligible to enroll based on their housing assistance. To learn more and enroll, visit www.GetInternet.gov or call (877) 384-2575 to request a paper application. “High-speed home internet allows American families to send their children to school and access healthcare, job training, critical government services, and work remotely,” said Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “HUD is committed to closing the broadband affordability gap so that every HUD-assisted resident has equal access to opportunities. We encourage PHAs and stakeholders to do all that they can do to enroll more families and individuals into the Affordable Connectivity Program.” “The FCC and HUD are working together to make it easier for millions of eligible HUD households to get access to broadband, which is necessary to participate in the 21st century,” said FCC Commissioner Geoffrey Starks. “It’s an honor to again join Secretary Fudge to highlight the Affordable Connectivity Program. I thank her for her leadership as we expand broadband to every American, including HUD households in rural, urban, suburban, and Tribal communities across the country.” Earlier this summer, HUD signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the FCC, to encourage enrollment in the ACP for HUD-assisted families. In 2023, HUD has helped organize and facilitate over 45 ACP enrollment events with community partners across the United States. Last week, HUD released a notice in the Federal Register expanding the Connect HomeUSA initiative. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Thursday, October 19, 2023",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_239,"Biden-Harris Administration Announces More Than $100 Million for Energy Efficiency and Climate Resilience Upgrades in 1,500 Low-Income Households","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today it is awarding $103.4 million in new loans and grants to significantly renovate the homes of 1,500 low-income households to be zero energy and resilient at 16 HUD-Assisted Multifamily Housing properties under the Green and Resilient Retrofit Program (GRRP) as part of President Biden’s Investing in America agenda, a key pillar of Bidenomics. Today’s GRRP awards will support working families and modest income individuals by making upgrades that could otherwise be cost-prohibitive to increase resilience and energy efficiency while enhancing their lives at home by structurally modernizing the homes. The awards represent the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to ensuring America’s clean energy economy translates into investments in more housing supply, and safer, healthier housing that is resilient to climate disasters. President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act—the largest climate investment in history-established the GRRP with more than $800 million in grant and loan subsidy funding to support up to $4 billion in loans. Recently, HUD announced its first-ever Funding Navigator, an interactive tool that allows users to browse and sort federal funding opportunities for billions of dollars in funding available under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL). In addition, under new direct pay provisions in the IRA, tax-exempt entities, Tribes, and units of government now qualify for 48, 48(e), and 11 other clean energy related tax credits. All the investments under the GRRP will advance President Biden’s historic environmental justice agenda by serving low-income families in disadvantaged communities, in alignment with the Administration’s Justice40 Initiative, which ensures the overall benefits of certain Federal investments flow to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized by underinvestment and overburdened by pollution. These investments will directly benefit residents of HUD-assisted housing, each in a disadvantaged community, and will make their homes more resilient to extreme weather events and enhance their ability to more quickly respond to and recover from such events. Without this funding, HUD-assisted multifamily properties would not be able to make the same investments in greener, safer, and healthier properties that other, market-rate multifamily properties are making today. “The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to building more affordable housing and improving the quality of life for residents living in those homes,” said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “The Green and Resilient Retrofit Program continues to improve our nation’s climate resilience by making sure low-income families and individuals have access to affordable housing that is strong, healthy, and energy efficient. Thanks to President Biden’s Investing in America agenda and Bidenomics, this investment brings the quality-of-life benefits of clean energy homes and advances our work, preserving the affordable housing in communities for the future.” Today’s investments will help combat the climate crisis, increase the supply of affordable housing, and support equitable economic development in American communities. In the GRRP Leading Edge category, owners are required to commit to achieving recognized green certifications, such as PHIUS REVIVE or LEEDv4 Gold or Platinum, that will lead to significant property upgrades such as on-site solar, wind turbines, FORTFIED-rated roofing, and other substantial energy efficiency and climate resilience improvements. To date, HUD has awarded more than $121 million in grants and loans in the first two GRRP funding waves, including today’s awards and awards announced on September 13, 2023, under the GRRP Elements category. In addition, to HUD’s GRRP funding, the agency continues its work to increase the supply of affordable and sustainable housing by releasing the Climate Resource for Housing Supply Framework. The Framework discusses how climate-related investments can support the development of housing, particularly affordable housing. Key objectives of this framework are to increase awareness of new funding that can be used to address both the housing shortage and climate change, and to demonstrate ways to increase project viability by layering new funding sources with existing resources. “In the past few months alone, we’ve witnessed devastating climate events that have destroyed people’s lives and homes,” said Assistant Secretary for Housing and Federal Housing Commissioner Julia Gordon. “We must protect and strengthen the homes in which Americans reside, particularly those occupied by our nation’s most vulnerable populations, which is why we’re working so hard to get climate resilience and energy efficiency resources into low-income communities across the country.” GRRP is the first HUD program to simultaneously invest in energy efficiency, renewable energy generation, climate resilience, and low embodied carbon materials in HUD-assisted multifamily housing. Investments under the program will be made in affordable housing communities serving low-income families in accordance with Bidenomics—President Biden’s agenda for building the American economy from the middle out and the bottom up. The GRRP Notices of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) and additional guidance released on May 11, 2023, detail the multiple funding options for which property owners may apply: Elements provides funding to owners for proven and meaningful climate resilience and utility efficiency measures in projects that are already in the process of being recapitalized. Leading Edge provides funding to owners with plans for ambitious retrofit activities to achieve an advanced green certification. Comprehensive provides funding to properties with the highest need for climate resilience and utility efficiency upgrades, regardless of prior development or environmental retrofit experience. Property owners are encouraged to continue to submit applications for grant awards or loans in any of the three categories. HUD is reviewing applications under one category each month for the duration of funding availability. HUD expects to announce awards regularly throughout 2023 and 2024, including awards under the Comprehensive category in the coming weeks.

"Wednesday, October 18, 2023",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_238,HUD Announces Expansion of the ConnectHomeUSA Initiative to Bridge the Digital Divide for HUD-Assisted Families,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is announcing the expansion of the ConnectHomeUSA (CHUSA) initiative through a notice in the Federal Register published today. This is the first time since 2020 that HUD is accepting new communities into the initiative, which works with Public Housing Authorities (PHAs), Tribally Designated Housing Entities (TDHEs), and Multifamily housing providers to put in place the key elements of a digital inclusion program. CHUSA is recognized by digital inclusion practitioners as an effective approach to addressing the digital divide in HUD-assisted communities. The initiative was originally launched in 2015 to close the homework gap in twenty-eight pilot communities. Since that time, 100 communities have participated in the initiative. “When communities, especially low-income communities, lack adequate access to broadband internet, they face barriers to economic and educational opportunities. ConnectHomeUSA allows us to bridge those barriers and ensure people in HUD-assisted housing can get and stay connected,” said Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “Today’s announcement is a major step towards advancing digital opportunities for people who receive HUD-assistance. We look forward to receiving public comment on the expansion and restructuring of ConnectHomeUSA, and we encourage PHAs to do all they can to enroll more families and individuals into the Affordable Connectivity Program.” This expansion will be highlighted at the CHUSA initiative’s 3-day virtual summit next week for ConnectHomeUSA communities, PHAs, TDHEs, public-private stakeholders, and anyone interested in promoting digital inclusion in their community. The summit will be held virtually between October 24 – 26, 2023, and interested parties can register. This expansion of ConnectHomeUSA builds on Secretary Marcia L. Fudge’s commitment to advancing digital equity and ensuring that families are connected to affordable internet. Earlier this summer, HUD signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), to encourage enrollment in the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) for HUD-assisted families. In 2023, HUD has helped organize and facilitate over 45 ACP enrollment events with community partners across the United States. The ACP is the nation’s largest broadband affordability program that offers low-income households discounts off the cost of broadband service and connected devices. HUD-assisted residents are eligible to enroll based on their housing assistance. To learn more and enroll, visit www.GetInternet.gov or call 877-384-2575 to request a paper application. The ConnectHomeUSA expansion is composed of two parts, which includes a 60-day public comment section which asks reviewers to comment on HUD’s proposed redesign of the CHUSA program into a three-tiered system, and instructions for submitting a letter of intent to be considered as CHUSA as an expansion community. Under the current redesign, there are three tiers for communities of interest. Tier 1 communities include communities that may be somewhat familiar with the concepts of digital equity or digital inclusion but may be unsure how to bridge the digital divide in their own communities. HUD is looking to accept between 50-100 new communities in this tier. Tier 2 communities include existing CHUSA communities. There is no limit to the number of communities that HUD will accept in this tier. Tier 3 communities will not be accepted at this time. Instead, Tier 3 will be reserved for communities that achieve key benchmarks along their CHUSA journey. Questions about the ConnectHomeUSA expansion can be directed to: ConnectHome@hud.gov. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Monday, October 16, 2023",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_237,Federal Housing Administration Expands Access to Mortgage Financing for Homes That Have or Will Include Accessory Dwelling Units,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, through the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), today announced a new policy which allows lenders to count income from small units of housing built inside, attached to, or on the same property as a primary residence (Accessory Dwelling Units (ADU)) when underwriting a mortgage. This change allows for the inclusion of rental income from the ADU in the borrower’s qualifying income and would allow more borrowers to qualify for FHA financing for properties with ADUs, including 203(k) Rehabilitation mortgages. ADUs can be rented out to tenants, thereby adding to the supply of housing in a community. In addition, this new policy will enable more first-time homebuyers, seniors, and inter-generational families to leverage the power of ADUs to enhance the generational wealth building potential of homeownership. Today’s announcement supports the Biden-Harris Administration’s Housing Supply Action Plan and reinforces the importance the Administration places on addressing the nation’s affordable housing challenges and increase access to homeownership. See a fact sheet released today, from the White House, announcing new actions on homeownership. “Increasing the supply of affordable housing and helping families to create generational wealth is what today’s action making it easier to finance an accessory dwelling unit is all about. This is a part of our work to help address the critical shortage of affordable housing in communities across the country and help people increase the value of their homes,” said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “The Biden- Harris Administration is committed to increasing the housing supply so that more people have access to quality housing that they can afford so that their families can thrive.” “With our new ADU policy, we’ll help households of more modest means maximize the potential benefits of homeownership to build wealth,” said Assistant Secretary for Housing and Federal Housing Commissioner Julia Gordon. “This new policy also contributes to the supply of affordable housing in many neighborhoods where it’s most needed and least available.” “The new policies provide greater flexibility for the use of rental income from ADUs, which will help more borrowers qualify for FHA-insured financing on homes with ADUs,” said Deputy Assistant Secretary for Single Family Housing Sarah Edelman. “We’re pleased that we’ve had such widespread support from the housing industry – support that has helped us deliver this meaningful solution for the nation’s homebuyers.” FHA defines an ADU as a single habitable living unit with a means of separate ingress and egress that meets the minimum requirements for a living unit. An ADU is a private space that is subordinate in size and can be added to, created within, or detached from a primary one-unit single-family dwelling. The new policies: Allow 75% of the estimated ADU rental income for some borrowers to qualify for an FHA-insured mortgage on a property with an existing ADU. This additional income flexibility will help to increase access to homes with ADUs for homebuyers with limited incomes, allowing them to benefit from the wealth-building opportunity of a property with an ADU. Use 50% of the estimated rental income, for some borrowers, from a new ADU the borrower plans to attach to an existing structure, such as in a garage or basement conversion, to qualify for a mortgage under FHA’s Standard 203(k) Rehabilitation Mortgage Insurance Program. This will enable more homeowners with limited incomes to build ADUs, helping them sustain homeownership and expanding the production of ADUs as rental housing. Include ADU-specific appraisal requirements for appraisers to clearly identify, analyze, and report on ADU characteristics and the estimated rent the ADU can be expected to generate. The guidance provided in the Mortgagee Letter will assist appraisers to more accurately determine the market value of a property with an ADU and also will help advance the maturation of ADU valuation, thereby increasing access to ADU financing as more cities and states remove zoning barriers. Add ADUs to the types of improvements that can be financed under FHA’s mortgages for new construction. This allows new homes to be built with ADUs from the ground up, an important source of ADU production in addition to rehabilitating existing structures. FHA-approved lenders may begin offering borrowers mortgages on properties with ADUs under the new policies effective immediately. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

This task force is part of a larger initiative across the Federal Government to enhance educational and economic opportunities for Hispanics and Latinos. “It is my honor to serve alongside talented, unique, and hard-working public servants of all backgrounds, including the Latino community” HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “I am in awe of the work our Hispanic colleagues have done to create the inaugural Latino Task Force, a group that will bring us closer to accomplishing our agency’s pledge to equity, inclusion, and diversity.” The Task Force will assemble career and political staff from all corners of the agency to promote economic opportunities for the Hispanic community, drive new policy initiatives to advance equity for the Hispanic community, and create a more inclusive Department through language access, procurement, and hiring. The Task Force was created in response to the Executive Order on the White House Initiative on Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence and Economic Opportunity for Hispanics, announced in September 2021. “As leaders of this Department, we have an incredible opportunity to shape how housing policies affect the Latino community across the country,” said Elizabeth de Leon Bhargava, HUD’s Assistant Secretary for Administration. “If we want to see a meaningful impact on policies, there need to be people at the table with the lived experience that can influence those decisions.” Over 20 HUD employees participated in the Task Force’s inaugural meeting, led by Assistant Secretary Bhargava, the highest-ranking Latina leader at HUD. Together, this group aims to achieve the following goals: Workforce Development and Economic Success Highlight and uplift current HUD policies affecting the Latino community. Identify improvement opportunities in HUD policies and communications. Highlight and uplift current HUD policies affecting the Latino community.

Increase access to HUD opportunities by ensuring Spanish language access across the Department’s applications and policies. The U.S. Hispanic population stands at 62.1 million, according to the 2020 U.S. Census. This means Hispanics account for 19 percent of all Americans – the largest ethnic-racial minority group in the country. Research shows that Hispanics experience severely inadequate housing at double the rate of non-Hispanics. In the 2019 “Worst Case Housing Needs” report to Congress, HUD found that between 2017 and 2019, nearly 25 percent of Hispanic households met the criteria for worst needs, either paying more than one-half of income toward housing costs, living in severely inadequate conditions, or both. Despite progress, representation of Hispanics in the federal workforce is still lacking. Participation rates for Hispanics in the Civilian Labor Force (CLF) for HUD stands at nearly 9 percent, representing only 706 total employees who identify as Latino or Hispanic.

"Thursday, October 12, 2023",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_235,HUD Announces $212 Million Funding Opportunity to Expand Affordable Housing Options for Persons with Disabilities,"Funding provides capital to produce new or rehabilitate existing housing along with project rental assistance to support very-low and extremely low income-persons with disabilities WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Office of Multifamily Housing announced today that $212 million in funding is available to expand the supply of affordable housing and supportive services for very-low and extremely-low-income persons with disabilities. The funding is available to participants in the Section 811 Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities program, which helps develop, subsidize, and provide supportive services for rental housing to meet the needs of this vulnerable population. “Every American should have the ability to live in affordable housing that caters to their needs. Unfortunately, today, far too many housing options are inaccessible to those with disabilities – and those with the appropriate accommodations are often too expensive,” said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “This announcement delivers serious progress, making $212 million available to expand housing supply and supportive services for low-income folks with disabilities.” Through the Section 811 Capital Advance/Project Rental Assistance Contract (PRAC) program, $106 million in capital advances can be used for the development of new or rehabilitation of existing supportive housing, along with project rental subsidies to keep homes affordable. The Section 811 Project Rental Assistance (PRA) provides $106 million to state housing and other agencies for project rental assistance to cover the difference between the tenants’ contributions toward rental payments and the HUD-approved rent for the property for eligible tenants with disabilities. “The goal is to provide people with disabilities the opportunity to live with dignity and independently within an integrated community that provides them with access to appropriate supportive services that they choose,” said Ethan Handelman, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Multifamily Housing Programs. “This funding is a small but important part of HUD’s overall commitment to meeting the housing needs of all communities.” For more information, read the funding notices for the Section 811 Capital Advance Program and Section 811 Project Rental Assistance. Applications must be submitted by February 8, 2024. About the Section 811 Program Section 811 allows persons with disabilities to live as independently as possible in the community by subsidizing rental housing which provides access to appropriate supportive services. The Section 811 Capital Advance Program aims to expand the supply of integrated affordable housing by providing Capital Advance funding for the development of permanent supportive rental housing for very-low-income (those earning 50 percent or less of the area median income) with disabilities who are 18 years of age or older and less than 62 years of age at entry. The program also provides project rental subsidies in the form of a Project Rental Assistance Contract (PRAC) to maintain ongoing affordability over at least the next forty years. The primary purpose of the Section 811 Project Rental Assistance (PRA) Program is to identify, stimulate, and support innovative state-level strategies that will transform and increase housing for extremely low-income persons (those earning 30 percent or less of area median income) with disabilities while also making available appropriate support and services. HUD is seeking to support collaborations between State Housing and Health and Human Service/Medicaid Agencies that will result in or will increase access to affordable permanent supportive housing units – new and existing – with access to appropriate services. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

HUD, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), are working to raise awareness, provide resources, and encourage preventive actions to decrease childhood lead exposure during the week and beyond. “Lead poisoning is not only a housing issue, it is an issue of health equity and addressing it is a top priority for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development,” said Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “While HUD has worked with communities across the country to make strides in reducing lead poisoning, thousands of children are still at risk of lead exposure. This week must be a reminder that our work is not done until no child in America suffers from lead exposure.” This year’s NLPPW theme, “Together, we can prevent lead exposure,” emphasizes the importance of coordinating to protect ourselves, our loved ones and our communities from the dangers of lead exposure. HUD invites partners to participate in the week of action. The outreach materials the agencies have created are customizable, allowing partners to select and tailor information to best meet the needs of their local communities. The materials are centered around three key messages: Get the Facts: Learn about lead exposure and its hazards. Get Your Child Tested: A blood test is the best way to find out if your child has lead poisoning. Talk to your child’s healthcare provider about getting a blood lead test if your child may have been exposed to lead. Get Your Home Tested: If your home was built before 1978, know and control your risk of lead exposure by hiring a certified professional to test it, and if lead hazards are found, one to control them. The outreach materials include an information kit with talking points, facts about lead and lead exposure, event ideas, and planning suggestions. The materials also include a sample social media package with content ideas, sample posts, and graphics centered around the three key messages above.

"Thursday, October 5, 2023",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_231,Fact Sheet: HUD Takes Historic Actions to Address Gender-Based Violence,"President Biden proclaimed October as Domestic Violence Awareness and Prevention Month and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) continues to raise awareness about HUD resources to support survivors of gender-based violence. This work includes providing critical information to grantees and other stakeholders on the housing protections of survivors under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). In October, HUD announced it will soon release a proposed rule to implement the 2022 reauthorization of Violence Against Women Act (VAWA 2022), which provides new housing protections, such as prohibiting retaliation against a survivor for claiming VAWA protections as well as a right to seek emergency assistance and contact the police for protection. HUD anticipates that the proposed rule will be published next year. HUD will be soliciting public comments on the proposed rule. As domestic violence affects millions of individuals and their families across the country, under the leadership of Secretary Marcia L. Fudge, HUD has taken ambitious actions to address gender-based violence, including: HUD has awarded $10 million in VAWA training and technical assistance funding to HUD technical assistance providers to provide support to HUD grantees implementing VAWA. The training and technical assistance will begin starting the fall of 2023. As part of the Fiscal Year 2022 Continuum of Care Program Competition, HUD awarded $54.6 million to 147 new projects for new projects that serve survivors of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault or stalking. Those projects totaled $54.4 million and included 95 permanent housing and rapid re-housing grants as well as 29 joint transitional housing/rapid-rehousing grants. This funding supports efforts to prevent survivors from becoming homeless or connecting survivors who may be homeless to housing services. To continue this work, the Fiscal Year 2023 Notice of Funding Opportunity for the Continuum of Care Program Competition included another $52 million set-aside for new projects that serve survivors of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault or stalking. In Fiscal Year 2022, Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) grantees used over $11.5 million of CDBG funds and another $8.1 million of CDBG-CV funds on services for survivors of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking. This resulted in the building of new shelters and housing for survivors. HUD published interim guidance for grantees in the Federal Register regarding implementing VAWA 2022. Since then, the Offices of Public and Indian Housing (PIH), Multi-Family Housing (MFH), Special Needs Assistance Programs (SNAPs), and Office of HIV/AIDS Housing (OHH) have issued memos or letters to their grantees providing guidance on implementing VAWA 2022. HUD created a VAWA website that serves as a clearinghouse of HUD’s VAWA resources for survivors, grantees, and other stakeholders. This website has recently been updated to include new VAWA trainings, a new section on VAWA cases, and additional VAWA guidance from program offices. HUD’s Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity reached two settlements with housing providers in Nevada and California under HUD’s new VAWA enforcement authority. HUD convened the agency’s first philanthropic roundtable on gender-based violence and housing. The event, organized with the Women’s Funding Network and Blue Shield Foundation of California, featured speakers from national and community-based organizations focused on combatting gender-based violence and addressing the housing needs of survivors, as well as senior leaders of foundations seeding change through strategic investments at this intersection. The Federal Housing Administration updated its Single Family Housing Policy Handbook, which included a policy change to help ensure survivors of domestic violence who own their homes can access loss mitigation programs to help retain their homes and avoid foreclosure. In 2021, Secretary Fudge established the Director on Gender-based Violence Prevention and Equity in the Office of the Secretary. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Wednesday, October 4, 2023",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_229,HUD Charges New Orleans Owner and Property Manager Based on Racial Linguistic Profiling and Familial Status Discrimination,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is charging N. Clark, LLC and Kathleen Cresson, owner and manager of a multi-family rental home in New Orleans, Louisiana, with discriminating against potential tenants based on race and familial status. Read the charge here. The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination based on race and familial status. This includes prohibiting housing providers from refusing to negotiate the rental with persons of a particular race and steering potential renters due to their familial status. The Act also prohibits housing providers from making discriminatory statements about renters with children. HUD’s charge alleges that Ms. Cresson screened potential tenants by allowing their calls to go to voicemail. She then failed to negotiate the rental with black testers while negotiating the rental with white testers. The charge also alleges that Ms. Cresson steered testers with children away from the property by repeatedly highlighting aspects of the property that purportedly made it unsuitable for families while making discriminatory statements indicating a preference for renters without children. “The Fair Housing Act of 1968 was specifically designed to combat racial discrimination in housing. A person’s race or the fact there are children in the household should not be barriers when trying to rent,” said Demetria L. McCain, HUD’s Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. “Today’s charge demonstrates HUD's ongoing commitment to ensuring enforcement of the Fair Housing Act when housing providers fail to comply.” “A landlord who ignores inquiries from tenants based on their race or who pressures potential tenants with children not to apply for housing is violating the Fair Housing Act,” said HUD General Counsel Damon Smith. “HUD is committed to eradicating unlawful housing discrimination in all the forms it may take.” A United States Administrative Law Judge will hear HUD’s charge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds, after a hearing, that discrimination has occurred, they may award damages to the fair housing organization for their losses as a result of the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, to deter further discrimination, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties to vindicate the public interest. If the federal court hears the case, the judge may also award punitive damages to the complainant. People who believe they are the victims of housing discrimination should contact HUD at (800) 669-9777 (voice) 800-927-9275 (TTY) or the Department of Justice at (800) 896-7743 or 202-514-4713.

WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) Office of Multifamily Housing Programs announced today that it has awarded $160.1 million in grants to non-profit organizations across the country to support the development of new or redeveloped affordable multifamily rental housing and ongoing project-based rental assistance for low-income seniors. “HUD is committed to addressing homelessness with urgency and ensuring everyone, including our nation’s seniors, has access to quality affordable housing,” said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “The funding announced today shows the Biden-Harris Administration is investing in Americans at every stage in life, working tirelessly to do everything we can to make sure older adults have the resources they need to stay housed and safe, especially as we witness a troubling rise in homelessness among seniors.” The grants support the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to one of the nation’s most vulnerable populations and are offered under HUD’s Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly program. Funds will help to facilitate the construction and operation of 1,262 new deeply rent-assisted units for low- and very low-income seniors. Several grantees will create mixed-income communities, building 526 additional affordable and market-rate units as part of these funded projects for a total of 1,788 homes. “These awards increase housing affordability and stability for seniors who are cost-burdened and need supportive services to live independently and to thrive in their communities,” said Assistant Secretary for Housing and Federal Housing Commissioner Julia Gordon. Section 202 grants provide low-income elderly persons 62 years of age or older with the opportunity to live independently in an environment that provides necessary services to meet their unique needs. HUD provides these funds to non-profit organizations in two forms: Capital Advances: This funding covers the cost of developing, acquiring, or rehabilitating the housing. Repayment is not required as long as the housing remains available for occupancy by very low-income elderly persons for at least 40 years. Project Rental Assistance Contracts (PRAC): This renewable project-based funding covers the difference between residents’ contributions toward rent and the cost of operating the project. The following grantees are the recipients of the awards announced today: Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly Awards About the Section 202 Program Section 202 grants provide very low-income elderly persons 62 years of age or older with the opportunity to live independently in an environment that provides support services, such as nutrition, transportation, continuing education, and/or health-related services, to meet their unique needs. Section 202 program eligibility requires residents to be very low-income or earn less than 50 percent of the area median income. Most households in the Section 202 program earn less than 30 percent of the median for their area. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

Read HUD’s Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) at Search Grants. This funding opportunity aims to develop decent, safe, and sanitary housing for low-income persons and families who would otherwise not have the opportunity to become homeowners. The continued partnerships with local communities and organizations that SHOP funds facilitate will help rebuild and revitalize neighborhoods and improve the lives of residents by expanding access to affordable housing and homeownership opportunities. “Owning a home can help a family maintain stability and build generational wealth, but homeownership remains out of reach for far too many people, especially low-income households,” said Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “This funding opportunity through the Self-Help Homeownership Opportunity Program will help our partners address current barriers to homeownership and allow more families access to its wealth building opportunities.” SHOP grant funds can be used to purchase home sites and develop or improve the infrastructure needed to set the stage for sweat equity and volunteer-based homeownership programs for low-income persons and families. The SHOP units must be sold to homebuyers at prices below the prevailing market price. Only national and regional non-profit organizations and consortia with experience providing self-help homeownership housing programs are eligible to apply. Applicants must propose to use a significant amount of SHOP grant funds in at least two states. Individuals are not eligible applicants for SHOP grant funds. Eligible expenses are limited to land acquisition, infrastructure improvements, and reasonable and necessary planning and administration costs (not to exceed 20 percent). A SHOP grantee can spend up to $25,000 per SHOP unit on the combined costs of land acquisition and infrastructure improvements from its SHOP grant award. Successful applicants must leverage other public and private funds to pay for the construction or rehabilitation costs of each SHOP unit and for any other program costs that are not assisted with SHOP grant funds. SHOP grantees may sub-award SHOP grant funds to local non-profit affiliate organizations to carry out the grantee’s SHOP program. The affiliate organizations must be located within the grantee’s service area. The NOFO offers preference points for Climate Change and Environmental Justice, Promise Zones, and Historically Black Colleges and Universities.

"Thursday, September 28, 2023",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_223,"HUD Reaches Settlements with Nevada/California Housing Providers, Resolving Allegations of Discrimination Against Survivors Protected Under the Violence Against Women Act","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced settlements with housing providers in Nevada and California, resolving allegations that they denied housing opportunities to two women because they experienced dating violence and stalking. The agreements are the first under HUD’s new enforcement authority under the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2022 (“VAWA 2022”), which President Biden signed into law on March 15, 2022. VAWA 2022 enhances housing protections for survivors of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking applying for and assisted under covered HUD housing programs and certain other federal housing and homeless assistance programs by authorizing HUD to enforce the law by the same process – and with the same rights and remedies – as the Fair Housing Act. Such rights include filing a discrimination complaint with HUD to investigate the allegations. The conciliation agreements provide monetary damages to the complainants, priority placement on the waiting list for available units, policy changes, staff training, and operational changes. If a respondent housing provider fails to comply with the terms of the agreement, HUD may refer it to the Department of Justice for enforcement. Under VAWA, individuals in certain Federal housing and homeless assistance programs cannot be denied housing, evicted, or lose assistance due to domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking. They also have the right to request an emergency transfer for safety reasons related to violence. VAWA 2022 ensures the right to call 9-1-1 without fear of losing housing, and it prohibits retaliation by housing providers for exercising VAWA rights or assisting others in doing so. These protections apply regardless of sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation. See summary of each agreement below: “With these first conciliation agreements, HUD underscores its ongoing commitment to enforcing the individuals’ rights enshrined in VAWA. These two cases represent a small percentage of persons who have filed with HUD under the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2022’s new process. Housing providers are on notice that they must comply with the law and not create unnecessary burdens to those seeking housing protections under VAWA,” said HUD Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary Demetria L. McCain. “At HUD, we are committed to protecting the housing rights of VAWA survivors and their families.” HUD Announces Settlement Agreement in Nevada HUD’s investigation found that a tenant who had a Housing Choice Voucher alleged that a Public Housing Agency in Nevada (“PHA”) and its Housing Specialist violated the complainant’s rights under VAWA when the complainant requested to relocate mid-lease as an emergency transfer after being stalked by a former partner. The complainant alleged that the housing provider demanded confusing and contradictory documentation that it was not permitted to request under VAWA, threatened to revoke the complainant’s voucher, denied her request to extend her voucher, and stopped paying its portion of the rent while the complainant prepared to move to protect her safety. HUD’s investigation indicated that the PHA’s policies and procedures did not comply with VAWA, including policies for documenting someone’s status as a VAWA survivor in general and, specifically, when an emergency transfer is requested. The PHA also lacked an emergency transfer plan, as required by VAWA. The agreement requires the housing provider to adopt and implement policies that comply with VAWA and will protect the VAWA rights of its applicants and residents, including that the PHA has an Emergency Transfer Plan that will allow survivors who qualify to move quickly without losing their assistance, to hire outside experts to provide VAWA training to staff, and to pay the complainant a monetary settlement. HUD Announces Settlement Agreement in California A woman filed a complaint alleging that a housing management company in CA, which is a recipient of funds under the HOME Investment Partnerships Program (“HOME”) and Low-Income Housing Tax Credits (“LIHTC”), and a property manager violated her rights under VAWA by denying her application due to a history of violations of the terms of previous rental agreements that were related to her status as a survivor of dating violence. Although the housing providers denied that the tenant disclosed her status as a dating violence survivor, they acknowledged that they failed to accompany the denial letter with any information about her rights under VAWA, as required by law, and that they did not advise her about how she might appeal the denial. Under the terms of the agreement, the housing providers will pay the complainant a monetary settlement, place her on the top of the waitlist for the next available unit at two properties, notify her in writing when such a unit becomes available, revise their policies and procedures to comply with VAWA and protect the VAWA rights of applicants and tenants, establish a VAWA Rights Coordinator to handle VAWA matters and compliance, and require their employees to complete VAWA training annually.

"Thursday, September 28, 2023",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_221,HUD Clarifies Civil Rights Protections Against Housing Discrimination on the Basis of Shared Ancestry or Ethnic Characteristics,"WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and seven other agencies across the federal government are for the first time clarifying in writing that Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits antisemitism, Islamophobia, and related forms of discrimination. In addition to shared ancestry and ethnic characteristics, religion is also a protected class under the Fair Housing Act, which HUD will continue to vigorously enforce. Today’s announcement is the latest step of the Biden-Harris Administration’s historic U.S. National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism, released in May 2023. “Antisemitism, Islamophobia, and any other form of hate have no place anywhere, including in the home,” said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “No one should be discriminated against because of their ancestry or ethnic characteristics or their faith or beliefs. Today’s announcement will further the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to combating discrimination in all its forms and guide our partners on the ground to enforce this country’s legal protections for Americans against acts of hatred.” “The fact sheet we are releasing today sends a strong message that discrimination on the basis of shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics is illegal under the Civil Rights Act,” said Demetria McCain, HUD’s Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. “This announcement is in line with HUD’s continued commitment to combat housing discrimination in all forms. It informs those who call America home of their right to be treated equally regardless of their shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics–putting us one step closer to building a housing system that prioritizes fairness and equality.” In addition to today’s announcement, HUD continues to contribute to the implementation of the Biden-Harris Administration’s National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism. In May, HUD issued a letter to 200 federally-funded housing programs on how to identify and counter antisemitism, Islamophobia, and related forms of bias and discrimination in housing. In addition, HUD is hosting a listening session in October for young adults to focus on fair housing rights, specifically related to protections on the basis of religion and shared ancestry and ethnic characteristics. Today, HUD joins seven other federal agencies — the Departments of Agriculture, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Labor, Treasury, and Transportation — to clarify how this law prohibits antisemitism, Islamophobia, and other forms of discrimination. HUD’s Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity (FHEO) works diligently to enforce the Fair Housing Act and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

"Wednesday, September 27, 2023",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_228,HUD Charges Landlord and Realtor With Disability Discrimination,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is charging a condominium owner and the owner’s realtor, in San Juan, Puerto Rico with violating the Fair Housing Act by refusing to renew a tenant’s lease based on disability, making discriminatory statements, and interfering with the tenant’s fair housing rights. Read the Charge. The Fair Housing Act (“Act”) prohibits discrimination based on disability. Such discrimination includes refusing to renew a lease based on a person’s disability, making discriminatory statements, or interfering with a tenant’s exercise of fair housing rights. HUD’s charge alleges that the landlord approved a six-month lease renewal but revoked that renewal and advised they intended to evict the tenant and his family one day after he disclosed his disability status. It is additionally alleged that housing providers made certain comments indicating a preference for non-disabled tenants. “The Fair Housing Act is a mechanism to end discrimination in all phases of home-buying or renting, and its enforcement puts us closer to securing equal access to safe, affordable, and accessible housing opportunity for all,” said Demetria L. McCain, HUD’s Principal Assistant Deputy Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. “HUD is committed to vigorously enforcing the Act to protect the rights of individuals with disabilities.” “The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from discriminating against individuals with disabilities and from interfering with their right to equal access to housing,” said Damon Smith, HUD’s General Counsel. “This charge is an important reminder that HUD will charge housing providers who fail to follow the law.” A United States Administrative Law Judge will hear HUD’s charge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds, after a hearing, that discrimination has occurred, they may award damages to the individuals for their losses as a result of the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, to deter further discrimination, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties to vindicate the public interest. If the federal court hears the case, the judge may also award punitive damages to the complainant. People who believe they are the victims of housing discrimination should contact HUD at (800) 669-9777 (voice) 800-927-9275 (TTY). Additional information is available at www.hud.gov/fairhousing .

"Wednesday, September 27, 2023",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_220,HUD Grants $2 Million to Advance Research Efforts Tackling Homelessness,"WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) awarded a combined $1.4 million to Northern Arizona University and New York University (NYU) Grossman School of Medicine under the University-Nonprofit Partnerships Engaged in Community-Based Research Designed to Address Homelessness Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) to support research to address homelessness that engages affected communities and elevates the perspectives and insights of people with lived experience. Additionally, HUD awarded $600K to NYU Furman Center under the Authority to Accept Unsolicited Proposals for Research Partnerships Notice to conduct research to address the impact of homelessness on families. “HUD is committed to working to ensure that everyone has access to a safe, stable place to call home and I’m pleased to see that today’s funding allows communities to research viable options to get people off the streets and into homes,” said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “HUD and the Biden-Harris Administration will continue to work with our local partners to work to end homelessness in communities across the country.” “HUD continues to be on the frontlines of fighting and ending homelessness and today’s funding announcement helps with just that,” said Solomon Greene, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research. “These research projects will help fill crucial knowledge gaps about solutions to end homelessness and help HUD, other federal agencies, and our state and local partners better understand the effectiveness of programs and interventions designed to address homelessness in communities.” Grants for University-Nonprofit Partnerships Supporting Community-Engaged Research Designed to Address Homelessness Under the Research Grant Designed to Address Homelessness, the Office of Policy Development and Research made available for institutions of higher education or nonprofit entities that train and support institutions of higher education to conduct research applying community-engaged research methods to address homelessness. Under this funding opportunity, HUD has selected two grantees to receive funding: Northern Arizona University will receive $726,306 for a 3-year project, divided into three phases that will document what is known about encampment resolution strategies and their effectiveness in the three most populous Arizona counties (Maricopa, Pima, and Yuma) as well as the experiences and impact of encampment resolution strategies among people experiencing homelessness. New York University (NYU) Grossman School of Medicine was awarded $631,902 to identify what services and housing resources are needed to better facilitate rapid transitions from homelessness to housing for adults aged 55 and older in New York City. The project aims to examine pathways from shelter to housing for older adults, including an examination of unique housing and/or support needs of this population, and to build capacity for community-engaged research at the intersection of health and housing. Research Partnerships Under the Research Partnerships program, the Office of Policy Development and Research (PD&R) has the authority to accept unsolicited research proposals that address current research priorities of the Department. Through the Research Partnerships program, HUD has selected a new applicant for funding: NYU Furman Center received $650,000 to estimate the impact of providing $1,000/month unconditional cash transfers for 12 months to families previously experiencing homelessness, who are exiting a rapid re-housing (RRH) program, on return to homelessness, housing stability, and rent burden, and explore mechanisms through which the cash transfers may impact these outcomes. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced nearly $1 million in grant awards to conduct rigorous research focused on closing gaps in access to mortgage financing and homeownership faced by borrowers of color and other underserved groups. “Homeownership is often the most direct path to generational wealth building. That is why HUD is committed to providing resources to help low-income renters access opportunities to purchase a home, if that is their choice,” said Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “Today’s announcement is a reminder of the importance of working with our local partners so people in all communities, but especially those that have historically been left out, can thrive.” “Under Secretary Fudge's leadership, HUD is prioritizing reducing the racial homeownership and wealth gaps that have persisted for decades,” Solomon Greene, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research. “Through this research, we look forward to learning what communities are doing to preserve and protect homeownership opportunities, particularly for home-seekers that have historically faced some of the greatest barriers to building wealth.” New America Foundation in partnership with the Winston-Salem State University was awarded $251,925. They propose to investigate whether declining access to small dollar mortgage loans - defined as loans for amounts less than $100,000 - disproportionately impacts Black families and contributes to the widening racial homeownership gap. The University of Michigan was awarded $330,000. Their proposal will look at two Detroit neighborhoods, Harmony Village and Condon, which have different racial makeups and will serve as focal points to understand the unavailability of mortgage financing to borrowers of color. Abt Associates received a grant of $416,358 for a comprehensive three-part project aimed at producing actionable insights to assist policymakers in boosting homeownership among Black and Latino renter households while reducing racial and ethnic homeownership disparities. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

The two-day convening will focus on Tribal housing issues and ways the Biden-Harris Administration can meet the housing needs of Native American communities. The first day will focus on discussions regarding HUD resources for Indian Country, infrastructure and development, programs and policy, homeownership, special needs and homelessness, and policy development and research. The second day will focus on a series of site visits to Tribal communities in the Tohono O’odham Nation. “HUD’s first-ever Tribal Intergovernmental Advisory Committee continues to play an important role in ensuring Tribal perspectives are heard and considered at the agency,” said Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “I applaud both the Tribal leaders and our HUD team’s collaboration, and I look forward to our continued work together to help Tribal communities thrive.” HUD formed its first TIAC in November 2022 and announced its creation at the White House Tribal Nations Summit. Many Federal agencies have Tribal Advisory Committees. The purpose of these committees is to allow Tribal leaders a forum to provide input on Departmental policies – especially before policies are adopted and implemented. The idea is to ensure Tribal leaders have a voice on all policy matters that will substantially affect their Tribal communities. “Under the leadership of Secretary Fudge, HUD’s Tribal Intergovernmental Advisory Committee helps us to address the unique concerns of Indian Country,” said Deputy Secretary Adrianne Todman. “This convening will continue the important work of building a strong partnership between HUD and Tribal communities while developing Departmental policies and efforts. The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to prioritizing relationships with Tribal Nations that are built on respect for Tribal sovereignty and self-governance, honor federal trust and treaty responsibilities, and protect Tribal homelands.” Like all Federal agencies, HUD has a trust responsibility and maintains a government-to-government relationship with Tribal Nations. This unique legal and political relationship fully respects the right to self-government and self-determination. Tribal Advisory Committees help foster that relationship and help Federal agencies develop policies that are appropriately tailored to the needs of Tribal communities.

"Monday, September 25, 2023",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_211,HUD Charges Landlord with Disability Discrimination,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced today that it is charging Lakeview Avenue, LLC (“Lakeview”) in Rensselaer, New York, and its employees with violating the Fair Housing Act by refusing a tenant’s request for a disability-related reasonable accommodation to keep an assistance animal and subjecting the tenant to retaliation for requesting a reasonable accommodation. Read the Charge. The Fair Housing Act (“Act”) prohibits discrimination and retaliation based on disability, which includes failing to grant reasonable accommodations and interfering with tenants’ exercise of rights protected by the Act. HUD’s charge alleges that the housing providers refused a tenant’s request to allow her disabled child to have an assistance animal in her unit. Although they provided medical documentation supporting the minor’s need for an assistance animal, the housing provider continued to deny the reasonable accommodation and impose onerous and discriminatory conditions. Shortly after her latest request for a reasonable accommodation, the tenant received a notice to vacate her unit and had to move to another, more expensive, apartment within her daughter’s school district “Individuals should not be confronted with obstacles when they try to access the safeguards offered under the Fair Housing Act,” said Demetria L. McCain, HUD Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. “HUD is committed to vigorously enforcing the Act to protect the rights of individuals with disabilities.” “The Fair Housing Act requires housing providers to make reasonable accommodations when necessary for an individual with disabilities to have equal enjoyment of housing,” said Damon Smith, HUD’s General Counsel. “That includes waiving a ‘no pets’ policy to permit a needed assistance animal.” A United States Administrative Law Judge will hear HUD’s charge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds, after a hearing, that discrimination has occurred, they may award damages to the individuals for their losses as a result of the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief to deter further discrimination and payment of attorney fees. Additionally, the judge may impose civil penalties to vindicate the public interest. If the federal court hears the case, the judge may also award punitive damages to the Complainants. People who believe they are the victims of housing discrimination should contact HUD at 800-669-9777 (voice) or 800-927-9275 (TTY). Additional information is available at www.hud.gov/fairhousing.

This Public Housing Operating Fund Shortfall funding, provided by the Fiscal Year 2023 Consolidated Appropriations Act, will enable PHAs to continue serving residents as they take steps to ensure long-term financial solvency. Please see the list of awardees here. “Public housing agencies need support to fully serve HUD-assisted households and families,” said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “This critical investment into public housing agencies across the country is a part of HUD’s commitment to meeting the needs of residents and taking steps toward long term financial stability.” “These funds stabilize PHAs experiencing financial shortfalls so that they can meet the needs of residents and ensure that they can maintain decent, safe, and sanitary public housing,” said Richard Monocchio, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing at HUD. “HUD will work closely with these agencies moving forward to develop plans to address the underlying drivers of shortfalls and help identify strategies to improve their financial stability.” PHA awardees facing shortfalls are defined as having less than three months of operating expenses held in reserve. While PHAs of various sizes may have been eligible to receive funding, HUD is concerned with the ability of small and very small PHAs to generate resources to supplement their public housing program and, therefore, prioritize these PHAs in the distribution of funds. To establish that PHAs that receive Shortfall funding take appropriate steps to ensure long-term financial solvency, HUD will monitor all PHAs that receive funding under this category. Additionally, HUD has identified and informed the PHAs of recommended actions that the PHAs can take to improve their financial performance.

"Thursday, September 21, 2023",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_210,HUD Announces Funding Navigator to Connect Program Participants to Billions of Dollars in Federal Funding and Tax Credits to Improve Carbon Reduction and Climate Resilience,"WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced its first-ever Funding Navigator, an interactive tool that allows the user to browse and sort funding opportunities for billions of dollars in funding available under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL). As a part of President Biden’s Investing in America agenda potentially eligible entities will be able to sort funding resources based on audience, activity, funding type, location, and other items. The Funding Navigator helps HUD program participants maximize the utilization of IRA and BIL resources for carbon reduction and climate resilience efforts. “The Biden-Harris Administration has released more money to improve our nation’s climate resilience than any other in history. HUD encourages our grantees and other eligible groups to apply for this available funding to improve carbon reduction and climate resilience,” said Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “The Funding Navigator will allow our partners to both identify and understand the opportunities available under the historic legislation President Biden has signed into law. HUD’s goal is and will continue to be making sure affordable housing is top of mind as critical investments are made in our nation’s infrastructure and climate related projects.” Over the summer, details on several IRA climate programs were released that provide an incredible opportunity for HUD-assisted communities. The programs support renewable energy, resiliency, and energy efficiency standards and make investments in affordable housing a priority. Programs like EPA’s National Clean Investment Fund and Clean Communities Investment Accelerator ($20 billion) calls out decarbonization of multifamily affordable housing as an example under one of three priority project categories for investment. Treasury’s Low-Income Communities Bonus Credit program (48e) provides a 20-percentage point credit boost for projects that benefit HUD-assisted properties and DOE’s Home Energy Rebate Programs ($8.5 billion) require states allocate 40% of rebates to low-income households and 10% to low-income multifamily buildings at a minimum. These and other programs provide transformative climate investments for low-income and disadvantaged communities, lower housing costs, and increase housing supply and affordability. HUD through its Funding Navigator and other tools is helping program participants understand and access these opportunities. In May, HUD launched the Build for the Future site on the HUD Exchange, pulling existing technical assistance (TA) resources and products on topics related to funding opportunities under IRA or BIL and putting them all in one place. Build for the Future empowers local communities to undertake initiatives focused on climate resiliency, energy efficiency, renewable energy, and environmental justice, offering guidance materials, and fostering peer-to-peer knowledge sharing. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

Today’s announcement of regulatory and administrative waivers issued by the Department builds on other support HUD is providing in the wake of the storm. “My thoughts are with the families whose homes were lost or had extensive damage caused by Hurricane Idalia,” said Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to giving our state and local partners resources and these waivers will help the people in their communities immediately rebuild their homes.” The regulatory and administrative relief announced covers the following HUD programs: Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), HOME Investment Partnerships (HOME), Housing Trust Fund (HTF), Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA), Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG), Continuum of Care (CoC), and Youth Homelessness Demonstration Program (YHDP). To expedite the use of these funds, HUD’s state and local partners can now access a waiver through a new simplified notification process. Through this waiver package, HUD is providing flexibility by: Allowing new housing construction with CDBG funding in declared disaster areas. Suspending the CDBG public services cap to provide additional support services related to the effects of the disaster on individuals and families. Waiving the HOME matching contribution requirements and CHDO set aside to expeditiously provide housing to displaced persons and repair properties damaged by the disaster. Providing flexibility in HOME tenant-based rental assistance requirements to reduce the burden for those seeking assistance. Extending term limits for certain types of assistance, including CDBG emergency grant payments and ESG rental assistance. This waiver follows HUD flexibilities announced on September 6 following the natural disaster declaration. Below are examples of what CPD funding can be used for in the wake of a disaster: housing rehabilitation housing reconstruction, homebuyer programs replacing disaster damaged residences, acquisition and relocation programs to help people move out of floodplains, infrastructure improvements, demolition of buildings, reconstruction or replacement of public facilities, small business grants and loans, and assistance to people experiencing or at risk of homelessness after a disaster. In March, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced an overhaul of the agency’s disaster recovery efforts to better serve communities that face the direct impacts of weather-related disasters. Based on the increasing number of disasters and the increasingly important role that HUD is playing in the federal government’s preparedness, response, and recovery efforts, the Department established the Office of Disaster Management (ODM) in the Office of the Deputy Secretary, the Office of Disaster Recovery (ODR) within the Office of Community Planning and Development and has added of dozens of new HUD staff members to help expedite recovery processes. These steps will streamline the agency’s disaster recovery and resilience work by increasing coordination, reducing bureaucracy, and increasing capacity to get recovery funding to communities more quickly by facilitating collaborative, transparent disaster recovery planning with communities earlier in the process. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) awarded today $60.3 million to build systems to end youth homelessness in 16 communities across the country, including four rural communities. The funding was awarded through HUD’s Youth Homelessness Demonstration Program (YHDP) to support a wide range of housing programs, including rapid rehousing, permanent supportive housing, transitional housing, and host homes. “Every young person in our country deserves a safe place to call home. Connecting homeless youth with appropriate, targeted housing and services will make an enormous difference in their lives,” Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “These federal funds will support efforts in communities across the county to provide vulnerable young people with the secure, stable, and supportive housing they urgently need.” The Department continues to work closely with youth to develop and improve YHDP, relying upon recommendations provided directly by young people who have experienced homelessness. Once again, HUD partnered with youth with lived experience to assess the applications submitted for funding consideration. Their assessment helped HUD ensure that applicants understood the needs and preferences of the young people they will serve. The Department also worked closely with its federal partners to help develop the program and review applications, including the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Education, and the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness. “HUD takes a youth-centric approach in our efforts to end youth homelessness,” said Deputy Secretary Adrianne Todman. “The Youth Homelessness Demonstration Program provides communities the opportunity to address the unique needs of youth and young adults and designs specific projects that meet their needs. With this funding, HUD is targeting federal resources to meet local needs and support community-driven efforts to end youth homelessness and improve outcomes through stable housing and services.” YHDP recipients will use their funding to address youth homelessness that is specifically tailored to their needs, including funding for housing units, wrap-around services, and housing support. YHDP will also support youth-focused performance measurement and coordinated entry systems. The goal of the YHDP is to support selected communities in the development and implementation of a coordinated community approach to preventing and ending youth homelessness. This community planning approach supports the foundations outlined in All In and will guide communities in designing solutions that match the needs of their community with special attention on creating equitable strategies to assist youth who are most vulnerable, including BIPOC, LGBTQIA+, and differently abled youth. All YHDP communities are required to establish Youth Action Boards, in which young people with lived experience lead the community effort to design, implement, and improve programs and policies to end youth homelessness in their communities. Including these awards, to date HUD has awarded YHDP funding to 110 communities, representing a $440 million investment to prevent and end youth homelessness.

Fudge. “I am proud of the role HUD plays to prevent discrimination against people with HIV, expand access to HIV housing and services, and, ultimately, reduce stigma.” Research shows that a stable home is critical to the well-being of people with HIV, and results in better health outcomes including viral suppression, and there is overwhelming evidence that has established an undetectable viral load means the virus is untransmittable. In addition to housing assistance, these local programs will provide access to supportive services such as case management, mental health services, substance use prevention, and employment training. The combination of housing assistance and supportive services is critical in sustaining housing stability, promoting better health outcomes, and increasing quality of life, which promotes self-sufficiency efforts for those able to transition to the private housing market. Since 1992, HUD’s HOPWA Program has provided national leadership and resources that support developing and operating high-quality supportive housing programs. Under the HOPWA Program, HUD provides grants to cities, states, and nonprofit organizations to provide housing assistance and supportive services to low-income persons with HIV and their families. By assisting with housing and related services, the HOPWA program helps persons with HIV enter into housing, access and remain in medical care, and adhere to complex treatment regimens.

"Monday, September 18, 2023",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_204,HUD Charges Landlord with Disability Discrimination,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced today that it is charging Ronit Mecham and Voyl “Tom” Mecham, the owner and property manager of a dwelling in Jamestown, New York, with violating the Fair Housing Act by refusing to allow a tenant with a disability to live with her assistance animal. Read the charge here. The Fair Housing Act (“Act”) prohibits discrimination based on disability. This includes refusing to provide reasonable accommodation so that persons with disabilities can have an equal opportunity to enjoy their housing. A reasonable accommodation includes waiving a “no pet” policy for assistance animals. The Act also prohibits statements that indicate a preference or limitation based on disability. “Assistance animals provide people with disabilities the support they need to enjoy the benefits of their housing,” said Demetria L. McCain, HUD’s Principal Assistant Deputy Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. “HUD is committed to zealously enforcing the Act to protect the rights of individuals with disabilities.” HUD’s Charge of Discrimination alleges that Respondents denied the tenant’s request for an assistance animal and then presented her with the option to either terminate the lease early or leave upon the end of the lease term. Although the tenant offered to submit medical documentation supporting her request, the Respondents stopped communicating with her instead. Additionally, the charge alleges that Respondents made comments indicating a preference for non-disabled tenants. “The Fair Housing Act requires housing providers to make reasonable accommodations that are necessary for an individual with disabilities to have equal enjoyment of housing,” said Damon Smith, HUD’s General Counsel. “That can include making exceptions to animal prohibitions.” A United States Administrative Law Judge will hear HUD’s Charge unless any party to the Charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds, after a hearing, that discrimination has occurred, they may award damages to the individuals for their losses as a result of the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief to deter further discrimination and payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties to vindicate the public interest. If the federal court hears the case, the judge may also award punitive damages to the complainant. People who believe they are the victims of housing discrimination should contact HUD at (800) 669-9777 (voice) 800-927-9275 (TTY) or the Department of Justice at (800) 896-7743 or 202-514-4713.

"Friday, September 15, 2023",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_201,HUD Announces $7 Million in Choice Neighborhoods Planning Grants,"Grants will fund community-driven revitalization planning in neighborhoods with distressed public housing. WASHINGTON - Today, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Marcia L. Fudge announced $7 million in Choice Neighborhoods Planning Grants to 14 communities across America. Each awardee will receive a $500,000 grant to create a comprehensive neighborhood revitalization plan to redevelop severely distressed public housing, improve outcomes for residents, and bring new amenities to high-poverty neighborhoods. The grants will go to communities of all sizes from small cities, such as Selma, AL, to larger urban areas, such as Albuquerque, NM, and Oklahoma City, OK. Increased appropriations and a renewed national interest fuel the program's expansion nationwide. This is the largest cohort of new Choice Neighborhoods Planning Grants since 2012. This year's awardees were selected from a pool of 28 applications. See the listing of specific organizations and funding amounts below. ""Choice Neighborhood Planning Grants represent HUD's commitment to creating new housing across the country,"" said Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""This federal investment builds the momentum neighborhoods need to make the big, impactful changes that will benefit residents and communities."" The Choice Neighborhoods program has a three-pronged ""Housing, People, and Neighborhood"" approach that includes the redevelopment of distressed properties and supportive services related to the residents' health, education, and income while investing in economic development and neighborhood improvement projects. A two-year Planning Grant will allow the new awardees to create and build support for a comprehensive ""Transformation Plan"" that addresses the program's Housing, People, and Neighborhood goals. ""Choice Neighborhoods Transformation Plans lead to real results for public housing communities,"" said Richard Monocchio, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing. ""Planning Grants are a great first step to bringing partners and significant resources to distressed communities – and they better position communities to pursue the funding necessary to bring a community's vision to life."" Since 2013, 65% of Choice Neighborhoods Implementation Grant awards were made to past Planning Grantees. Implementation Grants provide the funds needed to implement Transformation Plans, including redevelopment of distressed HUD-assisted housing. HUD recently awarded eight new Implementation Grants, totaling $370 million. HUD is also accepting new Implementation Grant applications until December 11, 2023. Many past grantees who have not pursued an Implementation Grant have nonetheless turned key pieces of their plan into a reality. Choice Neighborhoods is a critical tool to preserve and expand the supply of affordable housing. Choice Neighborhoods Implementation Grantees will complete over 37,000 mixed-income units across 52 cities. Overall, the Choice Neighborhoods program has led to new businesses, parks, and grocery stores, while resident incomes are increasing across most cities, sometimes doubling. Given the program's transformative reach, HUD continues to encourage eligible communities of all sizes to pursue a Choice Neighborhoods grant.

"Thursday, September 14, 2023",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_199,HUD Charges Nevada RV Resort with Discriminating Against Family with Minor Children,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is charging the Owners Association and General Manager of Preferred RV Resort, a recreational vehicle resort in Pahrump, Nevada, with discriminating against a family with three minor children. Read the charge. The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination against families with children under the age of 18. This includes using discriminatory terms and conditions for families with children, making discriminatory statements about them, and harassing tenants because they have young children. “RV parks that offer options for long-term stays are required to abide by the Fair Housing Act and ensure that they are providing families with children the same terms and conditions as adults without children,” said Demetria L. McCain, HUD’s Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. “HUD’s vigorous enforcement of the Fair Housing Act means ensuring that these types of residency options are just as available to families with children as those without children.” HUD’s Charge of Discrimination alleges that Preferred RV Resort, which houses some visitors year-round and others for up to nine months at a time, discriminated against families by placing unreasonable age restrictions on many of its amenities, including prohibiting anyone under 18 years old from being in the outdoor swimming pool unattended, contrary to state law, and restricting children under 14 years old from using the property’s billiards room and spa. The property’s management made statements admonishing parents about letting their children be unsupervised on the property, while images on the resort’s website and promotional materials are only of adults using and enjoying the resort’s amenities and grounds, with no depictions of children or families. “The Fair Housing Act protects the rights of families with children to enjoy equal access to the recreational amenities that many RV Parks, apartment buildings, and homeowners associations provide, without unreasonable restrictions,” said HUD’s General Counsel Damon Smith. “This Charge should serve as an important reminder to these owners of their responsibilities under the Fair Housing Act.” A United States Administrative Law Judge will hear HUD’s Charge unless any party to the Charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds, after a hearing, that discrimination has occurred, the judge may award damages to the family for their losses as a result of the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, to deter further discrimination, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties to vindicate the public interest. If a federal court hears the case, the judge may also award punitive damages to the complainants.

"Wednesday, September 13, 2023",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_195,HUD Announces Funding to Support Energy Efficiency and Climate Resilience in Multifamily Assisted Housing Properties as Part of President Biden’s Investing in America Agenda,"WASHINGTON - As part of President Biden’s Investing in America agenda, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced it has awarded approximately $18 million in grant funding and loan commitments under the Green and Resilient Retrofit Program (GRRP) to owners of properties participating in HUD-Assisted Multifamily Housing programs. President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act—the largest climate investment in history - established the GRRP with more than $800 million in grant and loan subsidy funding and $4 billion in loan commitment authority. It is the first HUD program to simultaneously invest in energy efficiency, renewable energy generation, climate resilience, and low embodied carbon materials in HUD-assisted multifamily housing. Investments under the program will be made in affordable housing communities serving low-income families in accordance with the Biden-Harris Administration's Justice 40 goals and advance Bidenomics – President Biden’s agenda for building the American economy from the middle out and the bottom up. Today’s first wave of awards will help fund upgrades for 28 multifamily properties with more than 3,400 HUD-Assisted Multifamily rental homes for low-income families, seniors, and persons with disabilities. “As a part of President Biden’s historic investment in climate resiliency, HUD is building a more equitable and sustainable housing system. This first wave of funding will invest in properties by making resiliency upgrades like adding solar panels, updating heating and cooling, and replacing windows,” said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “The Green and Resilient Retrofit Program advances our work to ensure low-income individuals and families have better access to healthy, energy efficient, and resilient homes.” “Today’s awards from HUD will bring the benefits of clean energy and climate resilience to hardworking American families in states across the nation,” said John Podesta, Senior Advisor to the President for Clean Energy Innovation and Implementation. “It’s all part of the President’s Bidenomics strategy to Invest in America and grow our economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down.” These investments will help combat the climate crisis and support equitable economic development in American communities. The funding enables building owners to invest in a range of technologies, such as geothermal energy systems, heat pumps, insulation and air sealing, wind- and fire-resistant roofing, low embodied carbon materials, and other measures, that will reduce energy costs and greenhouse gas emissions and make properties healthier and safer for residents in the face of more severe weather and changing climate. This is the first round of GRRP awards to be released, with additional rounds to be awarded throughout 2023 and 2024. “HUD is committed to building resilient communities and reducing costs, including lowering the cost of gas and electric bills for the families we assist. We also have an obligation to address the effects of climate change,” said HUD Deputy Secretary Adrianne Todman. “HUD’s new Green and Resilient Retrofit Program does just that.” “Today’s awards represent this Administration’s real and ongoing commitment to address climate change and improve the lives of low-income families by making their homes safer and more sustainable,” said Assistant Secretary for Housing and Federal Housing Commissioner Julia Gordon. “GRRP is a significant investment in communities that typically do not receive this type of assistance yet are often the most adversely affected by climate change.” Owners of properties participating in HUD’s Section 8 Project-Based Rental Assistance, Section 202 Supportive Housing for Low-Income Elderly, and Section 811 Supportive Housing for Low-Income Persons with Disabilities programs received grant or loan funding commitments today under the GRRP’s “Elements” award category. Elements awards provide funding for property owners to include climate resilience and energy and water efficiency improvements at properties that are already in the process of a development or rehabilitation transaction. Upgrades financed under the Elements category will support a range of improvements, such as installation of heat-wave resilient cool roofs and fire-resistant roofs, on-site solar power systems, insulation and air sealing, heat pumps, energy efficient windows, and similar upgrades. All the investments under the GRRP will advance environmental justice by serving low-income families in alignment with the Administration’s Justice40 initiative through strengthening their homes to be more resilient against extreme weather events and enhancing their ability to remain in their homes during the recovery from such events. Table 1: Green and Resilient Retrofit Program Elements Round One Awards The program’s Notices of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) and additional guidance released on May 11, 2023, detail the multiple grant and loan funding options for which property owners may apply under the program’s three categories: Elements provides funding to owners for proven and meaningful climate resilience and utility efficiency measures in projects that are already in the process of being recapitalized. Leading Edge provides funding to owners with plans for ambitious retrofit activities to achieve an advanced green certification. Comprehensive provides funding to properties with the highest need for climate resilience and utility efficiency upgrades, regardless of prior development or environmental retrofit experience. Property owners are encouraged to continue to submit applications for grant awards or loans in any of the three categories. HUD is accepting applications under one category each month for the duration of funding availability. HUD expects to announce awards regularly throughout 2023 and 2024, including awards under the Leading Edge category in the coming weeks."
"Friday, September 8, 2023",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_193,HUD Announces $157 Million to Address Housing-Related Hazards and Lead-Based Paint,"WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced the Capital Fund Housing-Related Hazards (HRH) & Lead-Based Paint (LBP) Capital Fund Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) awards. The NOFO provides a total of $158 million dollars, which includes 20 awards under Lead-Based Paint and 54 awards under Housing-Related Hazards. The purpose of the HRH and LBP Capital Funding is to provide funding to public housing agencies (PHAs) to evaluate and reduce residential health hazards in public housing, including lead-based paint, carbon monoxide, mold, radon, fire safety, and asbestos. In addition, the funds will help get PHAs ready to comply with the National Standards for the Physical Inspection of Real Estate (NSPIRE). NSPIRE improves HUD’s oversight by aligning and consolidating inspection regulations used to evaluate HUD housing across multiple programs. NSPIRE strengthens HUD’s physical condition standards, and fire safety, carbon monoxide, mold and moisture and lead-based paint are all standards that we enhanced with NSPIRE. “American families deserve a safe and healthy place to call home. However, in many older homes, lead-based paint can be a serious threat to the health and well-being of children,” said HUD Secretary Marcia Fudge. “This funding effort will help us identify homes where occupants are at risk of lead exposure and other health hazards, and build on our promise of a healthier, stronger country.” “Lead poisoning is an entirely preventable tragedy that dramatically impacts a child’s health and ability to learn,” said HUD Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary Richard Monocchio. “This funding opportunity will help families across the country protect their children from lead poisoning and exposure to other hazardous contaminants in their homes. Particularly in many of our neighborhoods with older housing stock, it is critical to identify and remediate housing units with potential lead-based paint to ensure our kids can grow up healthy.” FY 2022 Housing-Related Hazards Awards by State and Public Housing Authority Amount AL -

"Friday, September 8, 2023",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_192,"Release of HUD Housing Counseling Program Handbook Will Better Equip Housing Counseling Partners to Support Renters, Homebuyers, and Homeowners","WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) Office of Housing Counseling (OHC) published an update to its Housing Counseling Program Handbook. The update is the first set of comprehensive changes implemented since 2010 and will ensure that HUD’s housing counseling program participants have ready access to the information, they need to meet the needs of individuals and families seeking to buy, rent, or sustain their homes. Housing counselors play a pivotal role in helping low-to-moderate income households – particularly communities of color – prepare financially for the wealth building potential of homeownership and to obtain safe, decent, and affordable housing. “The updated Handbook will benefit those helping individuals and families with their housing needs,” said Assistant Secretary for Housing and Federal Housing Commissioner Julia Gordon. “Among other things, it includes enhanced guidance for counseling homeowners considering a Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) so they can make an informed choice about options for aging in place.” The Handbook also outlines how to become a HUD-approved housing counseling agency or HUD certified housing counselor and details the grant application process for those seeking HUD funding for their housing counseling programs. “We are pleased to announce the long-awaited updates to our Housing Counseling Program Handbook and expect the information will provide much needed guidance to our partners, which will ultimately support consumers exploring their housing options,” said Deputy Assistant Secretary for Housing Counseling David Berenbaum. The guidance in the Housing Counseling Program Handbook is effective on January 1, 2024. HUD-approved housing counseling agencies provide services to address a full range of housing counseling needs. These services include assisting homebuyers in evaluating their readiness for a home purchase and navigating through the homebuying process, helping individuals and households find affordable rental housing, offering financial literacy training to individuals and families, and providing foreclosure prevention counseling to distressed homeowners. In addition to providing counseling to homeowners and renters, HUD-approved housing counseling agencies support emergency preparedness and disaster recovery efforts, assist homeless persons in finding transitional housing, and help seniors determine whether a HECM or other reverse mortgage makes sense for them. To locate a HUD-approved housing counseling agency, visit HUD’s online locator or call (800) 569-4287 to use our interactive telephone locator service. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Wednesday, September 6, 2023",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_191,HUD Announces Assistance for Florida in Wake of Hurricane,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced the implementation of federal disaster relief for the state of Florida to assist state, tribal and local recovery efforts in the areas affected by Hurricane Idalia beginning on August 27, 2023, and continuing. President Biden issued a major disaster declaration “My thoughts are with those who lost or experienced damage to their homes. HUD’s role in a disaster is to ensure that people and communities can recover and return home. HUD is committed to seeing Florida’s recovery through,” said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. Effective immediately, HUD is: Providing a 90-day moratorium on foreclosures of mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) as well as foreclosures of mortgages to Native American borrowers guaranteed under the Section 184 Indian Home Loan Guarantee program. There is also a 90-day extension granted automatically for Home Equity Conversion Mortgages. The moratorium and extension are effective as of the President’s disaster declaration date. Homeowners affected by the disaster should contact their mortgage or loan servicer immediately for assistance. Conventional mortgage holders may also be eligible for additional relief through their mortgage holder. Call the FHA Resource Center at 1-800-304-9320 for additional information. To learn more about disaster relief options for FHA homeowners visit the FHA Disaster Relief site. Making mortgage insurance available - When homes are destroyed or damaged to an extent that required reconstruction or complete replacement, HUD’s Section 203(h) program provides FHA insurance to disaster victims. Borrowers from participating FHA approved lenders are eligible for 100 percent financing including closing costs. Making insurance available for both mortgage and home rehabilitation - HUD's Section 203(k) loan program also allows individuals to finance the purchase or refinance of a house along with its repair through a single mortgage. Homeowners can also finance the rehabilitation of their existing homes if damaged. Sharing information on housing providers and HUD programs - Information will be shared with FEMA and the State on housing providers that may have available units in the impacted counties, including Public Housing Agencies and Multi-Family owners. The Department will also connect FEMA and the State to subject matter experts to provide information on HUD programs and providers. Providing flexibility to Community Planning and Development Grantees - Recipients of Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program, Housing Opportunities for Persons With HIV/AIDS (HOPWA) Program, Continuum of Care (CoC) Program, Emergency Solutions Grants (ESG) Program, HOME Program, and Housing Trust Fund (HTF) Program funds can apply for needed administrative flexibility in response to natural disasters. For more information on applying for a waiver or suspension of program requirements, contact your local Community Planning and Development Program Office here. Providing flexibility to Public Housing Agencies - Public Housing Agencies can apply for needed waivers and flexibilities for disaster relief and recovery. For detailed information on applying for a waiver, click here for the latest Federal Register Disaster Relief Notice guidance. The Department also released PIH Notice 2021-34, which advises the public of HUD's expedited process for waivers and flexibilities from HUD regulatory and administrative requirements for various Public Housing and Voucher Programs. As a reminder, to be eligible to receive a disaster waiver, the PHA must be located in an active Presidentially declared Major Disaster Declaration area and submitted within four months of an MDD. Providing flexibility to Tribes - Tribes and their Tribally Designated Housing Entities can apply for needed administrative flexibility through regulatory waivers. For detailed information on how to apply for a waiver, Tribes and TDHEs should contact their local Office of Native American Programs or email Codetalk@hud.gov. Ensuring HUD-approved housing counseling agencies are ready to assist - HUD-approved housing counseling agencies have counselors available to assist those impacted by natural disasters to determine assistance needs and available resources.

You do not have to have an FHA-insured mortgage to meet with a HUD-approved housing counseling agency. There is never a fee for foreclosure prevention counseling. Assisting with housing discrimination - Housing discrimination sometimes occurs when people attempt to find and access housing following a disaster. HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity is available to assist people who believe they have experienced housing discrimination. If you think your rights have been violated, you should file a fair housing complaint with HUD. You can file a complaint by calling HUD at 1-800-669-9777 or visiting How to File a Complaint on HUD's website. Materials and assistance are available for persons with limited English proficiency. Individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing may contact the Department using the Federal Relay Service at 1-800-877-8339. You should file a complaint with HUD as soon as possible. HUD may not help you if your complaint is filed more than one year after the last discriminatory act. You may also be able to file a complaint with a state or local fair housing agency. A list of the state and local fair housing agencies funded by HUD is available on HUD’s website here. Recently, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced an overhaul of the agency’s disaster recovery efforts to better serve communities who face the direct impacts of weather-related disasters. Based on the increasing number of disasters and the increasingly important role that HUD is playing in federal government’s preparedness, response, and recovery efforts, the Department established the Office of Disaster Management (ODM) in the Office of the Deputy Secretary, the Office of Disaster Recovery (ODR) within the Office of Community Planning and Development and has added of dozens of new HUD staff members to help expedite recovery processes. These steps will streamline the agency’s disaster recovery and resilience work by increasing coordination, reducing bureaucracy, and increasing capacity to get recovery funding to communities more quickly by facilitating collaborative, transparent disaster recovery planning with communities earlier in the process. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Wednesday, September 6, 2023",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_190,HUD Makes Available $256 Million in New Choice Neighborhoods Funding,"WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced the availability of $256 million in Choice Neighborhoods Implementation (CNI) Grants funding to communities across the country. The CNI Grants will ultimately transform public and other HUD-assisted housing, while investing in the surrounding neighborhood and resident services. Public housing authorities, local governments, and/or Tribal entities are eligible and encouraged to apply for these transformative grants of up to $50 million each. The Notice of Funding Opportunity is available here. “Choice Neighborhoods Implementation Grants are a powerful tool communities can use to revitalize neighborhoods, bringing much-needed housing, services, and amenities to distressed areas,” said Secretary Marcia Fudge. “Today, we are pleased to invite public housing authorities, local governments, and Tribal entities to join the program and build on successes we’ve seen across the country. These $50 million awards are a once-in-a-generation investment in the housing, neighborhoods, and people that need it most.” Choice Neighborhoods is HUD’s signature place-based program. Increased appropriations and a renewed national interest are fueling the program’s expansion to distressed communities across America. While cities such as Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and Phoenix are grant recipients, mid-size and smaller cities such as Flint, MI; Lewiston, ME; and Tulsa, OK, have also received awards. This funding cycle will lead to six new Choice Neighborhoods Implementation Grants in 2024. CNI Grants primarily fund the redevelopment of severely distressed HUD properties into a mixed-income community. The program has a three-pronged “Housing, People, and Neighborhood” approach that includes not only the redevelopment of distressed properties but also supports outcomes related to the residents' health, education, and income while simultaneously investing in economic development and neighborhood improvement projects. This comprehensive approach means that grantees must be able to leverage the funds they receive from HUD with other public and private resources. This announcement follows HUD’s recent $370 million award of eight new Choice Neighborhoods Implementation Grants representing the cities of Atlanta, GA; Birmingham, AL; Lake Charles, LA; Miami, FL; Philadelphia, PA; Pittsburgh, PA; Tucson, AZ; and Wilmington, DE. Demonstrating the impact of Choice Neighborhoods investments locally, these eight recent awards will collectively invest $3 billion in distressed neighborhoods and create over 5,000 new housing units. Choice Neighborhoods is a critical tool to preserve and expand the supply of affordable housing. Since the program’s inception, the Choice Neighborhoods program has completed 13,000 new mixed-income units built across 52 cities. More than 37,000 units are planned. HUD has awarded more than $1.7 billion in Implementation Grant funds to date, with grantees achieving incredible results. For example, Memphis, Tennessee is using its grant to build 712 new, mixed-income housing units in the South City neighborhood, while also making repairs to surrounding homes and businesses. Similarly, Louisville, Kentucky is using its grant to build 620 new, mixed-income housing units. As a result, Louisville's Russell neighborhood has seen new retail and quality childcare services come into the community. Norwalk, Connecticut, which was devastated by Superstorm Sandy in 2012, used its Choice Neighborhoods Implementation Grant to develop 273 housing units and completed a major cleanup on an adjacent “brownfield” site that was converted into a beautiful neighborhood park. Overall, the Choice Neighborhoods program has led to new businesses, parks, and grocery stores, while resident incomes are increasing across most cities, in some cases doubling. A recent study conducted by Case Western Reserve University on the Chicago Choice Neighborhood showed HUD’s investment generated $400 million in public and private resources. In addition, the study found median household incomes increased, crime rates fell steadily, and home ownership rates increased. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Friday, September 1, 2023",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_189,HUD Charges Owner and Property Manager of Missouri Area Rental Properties with Discrimination Based on Sex,"WASHINGTON - Today the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced that it is charging Second Bell Trust, owner of multiple single-family rental properties in the Springfield Missouri area, and its agent and property manager, Jimmie Bell, with housing discrimination for allegedly subjecting a female tenant to sexual harassment, including requests for sexual favors in exchange for rent, unwanted touching, and discriminatory statements based on sex. Read the charge. The Fair Housing Act prohibits sexual harassment of tenants and other forms of housing discrimination based on race, sex (including sexual orientation and gender identity), color, national origin, disability, religion, and familial status. ""Subjecting tenants to unwelcome sexual advances and sexual harassment is outrageous and a clear violation of the law,"" said Demetria L. McCain, HUD's Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Today's charge sends a clear message to all landlords that HUD is committed to taking action against landlords whose behavior violates the Fair Housing Act."" ""The intolerable and deplorable conduct alleged in this case constitutes sexual harassment that violates the Fair Housing Act,"" said Damon Smith, HUD's General Counsel. ""HUD is committed to protecting the rights of tenants to be free from such harassment by their landlords."" HUD's charge, issued on behalf of the tenant and her children and nephew, alleges Jimmie Bell made repeated unwelcome sexual comments to the tenant and pressured her to provide sexual favors when she fell behind on rent payments. The charge further alleges Bell grabbed the tenant’s intimate areas. The tenant and her children moved out after enduring several years of sexual harassment from Bell. HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages to the complainant for harm caused by discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose fines to vindicate the public interest. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages. Persons who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Thursday, August 31, 2023",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_187,HUD Awards Over $24 Million to 57 Grantees to Fight Housing Discrimination,"WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced the allocation of $24,195,749.33 from its $56 million FY 2023 budget to support 57 fair housing organizations across the nation through the Fair Housing Initiatives Program (FHIP). These funds are being directed to second and third year multi-year grantees of the Private Enforcement Initiative (PEI) to continue their ongoing fair housing enforcement endeavors on a national scale. Furthermore, HUD has extended financial support to the Disability Law Center under the PEI initiative and JC Vision and Associates under the Fair Housing Organization Initiative/Continued Development Component (FHOI/CDC) program, utilizing unspent funds from the FY 2022 budget. A detailed breakdown of the awardees categorized by state can be found here. “Unfortunately, far too many families face bias when it comes to renting and buying homes,” said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “HUD is pleased to provide our state and local partners with resources like The Fair Housing Initiatives Program that give organizations the funding they need to combat housing discrimination and help build fair and inclusive communities.” Each year, HUD makes funding available to support organizations that enforce the nation’s fair housing laws and policies, as well as educate the public, housing providers, and local governments about their rights and responsibilities under the Fair Housing Act. The granted funds will empower the recipients to carry out fair housing enforcement through a range of activities. These include conducting thorough investigations, implementing testing methodologies to uncover instances of discrimination in both rental and sales markets, and taking the necessary steps to file fair housing complaints either with HUD or equivalent state and local agencies. Beyond enforcement efforts, the grantees will also engage in educational and outreach initiatives. Their aim is to educate the general public, housing providers, and local government bodies about the rights and obligations outlined in the Fair Housing Act and the fair housing services that grantees provide. “The programs and services provided by the Fair Housing Initiatives Program are essential to HUD’s mission and fulfill a vital role in enforcing the Fair Housing Act,” said Demetria L. McCain, HUD’s Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. “The funds provided today demonstrate HUD’s commitment to opposing discriminatory practices and ensure that our fair housing partners have the financial resources they need to continue educating the public.” HUD is awarding grants in the following categories: Private Enforcement Initiative (PEI) – This initiative funds non-profit fair housing organizations to conduct testing and enforcement activities to prevent or eliminate discriminatory housing practices. Fair Housing Organizations Initiative (FHOI) – This program provides funding that builds the capacity and effectiveness of non-profit fair housing organizations by providing funds to handle fair housing enforcement and education initiatives more effectively.

"Thursday, August 31, 2023",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_186,HUD Updates Fair Market Rents; Makes $113 Million Available in Affordable Housing Vouchers,"WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced two actions that together will enable more families to rent a healthy, stable home at an affordable cost: publishing Fair Market Rents (FMRs) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 and releasing an additional $113 million in Housing Choice Vouchers to public housing agencies to help 9,500 families to meet these growing costs. ""Housing choice vouchers are some of the strongest tools we have to help families find stable and affordable housing,"" said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""This year, HUD found that rents rose once again, accentuating the strain on costs for American families. These updated Fair Market Rents and our funding will ensure households can utilize vouchers in a competitive rental market."" First, the Office of Policy Development and Research (PD&R) published Fair Market Rents (FMRs) for FY 2024, which helps to determine the maximum amount a Housing Choice Voucher will cover. Nationally, FMRs will increase by an average of approximately 12 percent, which will increase the number of units that families using housing vouchers can access. ""Increases in Fair Market Rents help families find homes of their choosing in competitive housing markets,” said Solomon Greene, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research. “This year we are continuing improvements we made last year to how we calculate Fair Market Rents to make sure they are keeping up with rising rents. We’ve already seen these improvements help more voucher holders find housing that is affordable, and we expect these new updates will help even more families."" The Office of Public and Indian Housing (PIH) also announced an additional $113 million in Housing Choice Voucher funding awards for 118 high-performing public housing agencies in 36 states. These funds will enable these agencies to provide rental assistance to 9,500 additional households in the coming year. “We want to make sure communities have the tools they need to help families lease homes,” said Richard J. Monocchio, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing. “The additional funding we are awarding to housing authorities today helps these agencies that are already maximizing funds to house as many families as possible.” Click here to view the FY24 FMRs. FAQs on the FY24 FMRs are available here. The Housing Choice Voucher program enables families to afford rental units in the private market. Given recent rental cost increases, families who receive vouchers are experiencing greater difficulty successfully using their vouchers to find affordable, safe, and quality housing. The new FMR levels announced today – on top of an approximately 10 percent increase nationally in FY 2023 – will help the voucher program keep up with rent increases in the private market, expand the number of affordable units, and help more families rent homes at an affordable cost. Housing Choice Vouchers are a key element of the Biden-Harris Administration’s strategy to reduce homelessness and provide American families with tangible resources to address rising living costs. Since entering office, the Biden-Harris Administration has awarded more than 100,000 new housing vouchers to help more families afford a healthy, stable place to rent. Today’s voucher allocations are listed here by state: Amount AL $493,221 AR $81,106 AZ $2,252,079 CA $36,998,830 CO $1,735,957 FL $766,113 IA $130,217 IL $1,142,724 IN $1,284,985 KS $291,302 LA $1,301,054 MA $1,212,802 MD $1,070,592 ME $21,790 MI $713,453 MN $541,748 MO $425,427 NC $156,213 ND $1,293,346 NJ $3,130,719 NM $481,183 NY $1,887,884 OH $29,292 OK $2,471,861 OR $2,012,751 PA $4,647,875 RI $446,364 PR $25,962 SC $96,338 TN $432,579 TX $33,794,190 UT $1,696,376 VA $4,486,598 WA $2,619,697 WI $2,255,077 WV $145,092 TOTAL $112,572,797 ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge made the announcement today in Kenai, Alaska, where she presented $7.5 million to the Kenaitze-Salamatof to build 18 new housing units to increase the number of homes available to low-income Alaskan Native families. “This vital funding allows Tribes to make investments in safe, affordable housing,” said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “I am pleased to make this announcement here in Kenai, Alaska, where Tribes face pressing and unique challenges in providing housing to families. Indian Housing Block Grant Competitive awards provide Tribes with funding to address these challenges in ways that best serve their communities.” The Indian Housing Block Grant Competitive (IHBG) funds play a crucial role in bolstering vibrant American Indian and Alaska Native communities. These funds are designated for various purposes, such as new construction, rehabilitation, and infrastructure to support affordable housing within Indian reservations and similar areas. The IHBG Competitive program holds particular significance for Tribal communities as it injects essential financial resources that aid in establishing new affordable housing options for disadvantaged Tribal families. This funding serves as a valuable addition to the yearly IHBG formula funding, which often falls short in covering the expenses of constructing new homes and is typically allocated for the operation and upkeep of current housing. Notably, since 2019, the IHBG Competitive grants awarded to Tribes have surpassed the corresponding IHBG Formula grants by an average of 67 percent. Furthermore, 94 percent of these awards have been channeled towards supporting the construction of new housing units, addressing a pressing need across Indian country. Today, in furtherance of the Federal Government’s trust responsibility, HUD makes another investment in Tribal communities by awarding $128 million to 22 communities through the Competitive Program.

"Monday, August 28, 2023",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_183,HUD and FCC Partner to Promote Affordable Internet Access for Low-Income Communities,"Goal is to Encourage Participation in the Affordable Connectivity Program Among Families Receiving Federal Housing Assistance WASHINGTON - The Federal Communications Commission and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) formalized a partnership to promote awareness of the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) among federal housing assistance recipients. HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge announced the partnership while engaging with community members and touring a newly built computer lab at Yesler Terrace in Seattle, Washington. The partnership agreement will decrease the time it takes for some people to sign up for the program and is coupled by HUD’s commitment to increase outreach activities. The partnership furthers work the Commission is doing to coordinate with other federal agencies to ensure that low-income households participating in eligible federal assistance programs are provided information about the ACP, including how to enroll in the program. Starting this week, the FCC and HUD will partner on ACP outreach targeted toward recipients of public housing assistance. “I am pleased to partner with the Federal Communications Commission to close the digital divide and to spread the word about the Affordable Connectivity Program. All recipients of HUD assistance are eligible to receive free or reduced cost internet through the Affordable Connectivity Program. I personally encourage you to sign up,” said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “We are deeply committed to ensuring families and their children have the necessary resources to thrive, and this partnership makes it clear that eligible HUD households can get the financial help they need to equitably access broadband resources.” Under the Secretary’s leadership, HUD has taken action to increase the enrollment of HUD residents in the Affordable Connectivity Program. HUD clarified that receiving benefits through the ACP will not impact the amount of rent that HUD-assisted tenants pay. The Department is streamlining the process of enrolling in the ACP through data sharing agreements that enable voucher holders and public housing residents to enroll with reduced paperwork, and soon will enable Multifamily residents to do the same. HUD’s field offices have been holding regional enrollment events across the country and will soon be doing so with FCC sign up stations. Since its inception, FCC staff has engaged in extensive outreach to help raise awareness of the ACP among households participating in qualifying governmental assistance programs, including the creation of the Your Home, Your Internet pilot outreach program. FCC coordination with HUD is a valuable component of ACP outreach efforts because HUD oversees qualifying federal housing assistance programs. “This agreement builds on our ongoing and tireless efforts to broaden awareness of an essential cost-saving program that can bring connectivity to families on the wrong side of the digital divide,” said FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel. “I appreciate Secretary Fudge and our government partners for joining with us in getting the word out to consumers receiving federal housing assistance so they can learn about the ACP, and if they are eligible, to sign up and get connected.” “As we’ve seen with the Your Home, Your Internet program, there is a particular nexus between housing and connectivity: if we can help a family secure housing, we should be able to help them secure an internet connection as well,” said FCC Commissioner Geoffrey Starks. “With better coordination between HUD and the FCC, we will get closer to ensuring that the millions of eligible households receiving federal housing assistance have the opportunity to enroll in ACP and get connected.” With the partnership in place, the FCC and HUD will work together to increase awareness of the ACP among HUD-assisted households through: Outreach and enrollment events at public housing, in properties participating in HUD’s multifamily project-based rental assistance programs, and with key partners; Regular coordination meetings to review work on ACP outreach intended to target HUD-assisted households including through a series joint in person enrollment events around the country; Collaboration on ACP outreach and education efforts, including development of messaging and targeting intended audiences. More than 20 million households have enrolled in the Affordable Connectivity Program. The program provides a monthly discount of up to $30 per month toward internet service for eligible households and up to $75 per month for households on qualifying Tribal lands. Eligible households participating in the ACP can also receive a one-time discount of up to $100 to purchase a laptop, desktop computer, or tablet from participating providers if they contribute more than $10 and less than $50 toward the purchase price. Consumers can find more information about the program, find out if they are eligible, and learn how to apply through this link: https://getinternet.gov. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Friday, August 25, 2023",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_182,HUD Announces $138 Million for 2023 Disaster Recovery,"WASHINGTON - Today, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Marcia L. Fudge announced the allocation of $138 million in Community Development Block Grant – Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) funds to provide additional help to communities recovering from three disasters, including California, Alabama, and Georgia. These allocations underscore HUD and the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to equitably improving the nation’s disaster recovery and building long-term, inclusive resilience to the impacts of climate change, particularly for historically marginalized communities. Secretary Marcia Fudge makes this announcement during her travels to California (San Bernardino and Santa Barbara) to lift the Biden-Harris Administration’s work to Invest in America and connect Californians to affordable housing. Secretary Fudge was joined by Representatives Carbajal, Aguilar, and other local officials to discuss HUD’s work to increase the supply of affordable housing, address homelessness and recover from weather related disasters. “With natural disasters increasing in frequency and intensity, it is critical that states have the necessary resources to rebuild homes, essential community facilities, and our economy,” said HUD Secretary Marcia Fudge. “The Community Development Block Grant – Disaster Recovery funds will provide critical assistance to rehabilitate impacted homes and improve infrastructure in the areas that need it the most without placing the sole burden of funding costly projects on state and local entities.” The $138 million in funding will help California, Alabama, and Georgia recover from severe thunderstorms and historic levels of rain and snow that flooded roads and homes earlier this year. On January 14, 2023, President Joe Biden declared that a major disaster exists in the state of California and announced federal disaster assistance be made available to California to supplement state, Tribal, and local recovery efforts in the areas affected by severe winter storms, straight-line winds, flooding, landslides, and mudslides. On January 15, 2023, President Joe Biden declared that a major disaster exists in the state of Alabama and ordered Federal aid to supplement state, Tribal, and local recovery efforts in the areas affected by severe storms, straight-line winds, and tornadoes. On January 12, 2023, President Joe Biden declared that a major disaster exists in the state of Georgia and ordered Federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts in the areas affected by severe storms, straight-line winds, and tornadoes.

"Wednesday, August 23, 2023",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_179,HUD Announces Funding to Support People Experiencing Homelessness in Maui through Rapid Response Program,"Grant will be awarded to state of Hawaii consisting of $1.3 million to help communities in Maui in wake of the wildfires. WASHINGTON - Today the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) awarded $1.3 Million to the state of Hawai’i to support people experiencing homelessness – those living in an emergency shelter, transitional housing, or a place not meant for human habitation – and people at risk of homelessness through the department’s Rapid Unsheltered Survivor Housing (RUSH) program. This funding is awarded to help communities in Maui in the wake of the wildfires. While FEMA, the Red Cross and local community members have stepped up to assist survivors, the severity of the damage and displacement experienced in Lāhainā and Upcountry Maui has exceeded local sheltering capacity and more assistance is needed. RUSH funding is responding to the surge in shelter needs to assist the community in addressing homelessness that could be exacerbated by the disaster. The funding HUD is making available in this announcement will help ensure that most people experiencing homelessness are not forgotten. “Before the wildfires, Hawai’i already had a housing crisis – one that disproportionally impacts Native Hawaiians. HUD is closely monitoring the impact of this disaster on local housing needs, and this funding will fill the gap to ensure the state of Hawai’i has what it needs to support people experiencing homelessness,” said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “HUD is invested in supporting Maui's recovery and will continue to work with local officials to support the path forward.” The eligible activities for this funding include: For people currently experiencing homelessness: emergency shelter; rapid re-housing, which provides up to 24 months of rental assistance, financial assistance for move in costs, and supportive services; and For people who are at-risk of experiencing homelessness: homelessness prevention, which provides up to 24 months of rental assistance, utility assistance, and supportive services for people at risk of homelessness; and outreach assistance, including assistance to meet urgent needs. RUSH funding is available to help communities provide outreach, emergency shelter, rapid re-housing, and other assistance to people experiencing or at risk of homelessness who are in a disaster-affected area but cannot access all services provided by FEMA programs. HUD is providing this allocations due to FEMA activation of Transitional Sheltering Assistance, which is done in disasters where there is a high level of displacement. RUSH will fill gaps in federal disaster assistance for people experiencing or at risk of experiencing homelessness. People experiencing pre-disaster homelessness have very limited eligibility for FEMA Transitional Sheltering Assistance (TSA). ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Wednesday, August 23, 2023",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_178b,HUD and Census Bureau Report New Residential Sales in July 2023,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Census Bureau jointly announced the following new residential sales statistics for July 2023: New Home Sales Sales of new single‐family houses in July 2023 were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 714,000, according to estimates released jointly today by the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. This is 4.4 percent (±12.8 percent)* above the revised June rate of 684,000, and is 31.5 percent (±16.3 percent)* above the July 2022 estimate of 543,000. Sales Price The median sales price of new houses sold in July 2023 was $436,700. The average sales price was $513,300. For Sale Inventory and Months’ Supply The seasonally‐adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of July was 437,000. This represents a supply of 7.3 months at the current sales rate. The August report is scheduled for release on September 26, 2023. View the full schedule in the Economic Briefing Room: www.census.gov/economic‐indicators/. The full text and tables for this release can be found at www.census.gov/construction/nrs/ EXPLANATORY NOTES These statistics are estimated from sample surveys. They are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated average relative standard errors of the preliminary data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as “2.5 percent (±3.2%) above” appears in the text, this indicates the range (‐0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90‐percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. Changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show irregular movement. It takes 4 months to establish a trend for new houses sold. Preliminary new home sales figures are subject to revision due to the survey methodology and definitions used. The survey is primarily based on a sample of houses selected from building permits. Since a “sale” is defined as a deposit taken or sales agreement signed, this can occur prior to a permit being issued. An estimate of these prior sales is included in the sales figure. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimate of total sales is revised about 4.2 percent. Changes in sales price data reflect changes in the distribution of houses by region, size, etc., as well as changes in the prices of houses with identical characteristics. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at the Census Bureau’s website. * The 90 percent confidence interval includes zero. In such cases, there is insufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero. Notice of Revision: With this release, seasonally adjusted estimates of housing units sold, housing units for sale, and the months' supply of new housing have been revised back to January 2018. All revised estimates are available on the Census Bureau website."
"Tuesday, August 22, 2023",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_178,Data Reports Show that Surge in Homelessness Was Averted During COVID-19 National Emergency,"Two New HUD reports suggest that federal relief prevented a rise in evictions and homelessness during the pandemic. WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) released new research and data showing that, despite historically high housing needs during the COVID-19 pandemic, rates of sheltered homelessness declined in 2021. HUD experts and independent research suggest that pandemic relief efforts prevented a potential surge in evictions and housing instability and temporarily reduced homelessness during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. In an article published today in HUD’s online magazine, the PD&R Edge, HUD experts also outline key lessons from past research about how the federal, state and local governments can work together to prevent and end homelessness. The Executive Summary of the biennial Worst Case Housing Needs report, published today, analyzes data from 2021 and estimates that 8.53 million renter households had “worst case needs” in that year, the highest number since HUD started estimating these needs in 1978. Households with worst case needs are defined as renter households with very low incomes (incomes at or below 50 percent of area median income) who do not receive government housing assistance and pay more than one-half of their income for rent, live in severely inadequate conditions, or both. Much of this increase was driven by rising rents and severe cost burdens faced by many low-income families as the rental market tightened. Despite these trends, HUD’s Annual Homelessness Assessment Report: Part 2 for FY21, published last month, shows that fewer people entered a shelter program in 2021, and sheltered homelessness overall decreased by 17 percent between 2019 and 2021. In an article in HUD’s online magazine, the PD&R Edge, HUD leaders summarize the research and suggest that federal interventions, including the Emergency Rental Assistance program, eviction moratoria, income supports like stimulus payments, the enhanced unemployment insurance, and the enhanced Child Tax Credit, the federal government helped prevent a worsening of homelessness and evictions. “During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Biden-Harris Administration and Congress were able to prevent millions of people from experiencing evictions and housing loss. We were able prevent a spike in homelessness during the height of the pandemic,” said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “While we didn’t solve the challenge of homelessness - only ensuring an adequate supply of affordable housing and access to supportive care can do that - these data provide valuable insights about how we address homelessness and ensure every person has a safe and stable place to call home.” Building on best practices and evidenced-based research, the Biden-Harris Administration has deployed historic resources in 2023 to address the crisis of homelessness. Earlier this year, HUD released a first-of-its-kind package of grants totaling $486 million and approximately 3,300 housing vouchers to help 62 communities address unsheltered homelessness and homeless encampments. In addition, through the ALL INside initiative, the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH) and its 19 federal member agencies will partner with state and local governments to strengthen and accelerate local efforts to get unsheltered people into homes in six places: Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, Phoenix Metro, Seattle, and the State of California.

"Tuesday, August 22, 2023",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_177,"HUD, Oregon Housing Providers Settle Claim Alleging Disability Discrimination","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that Kye Patton and Bob Cave, the owner, and manager of a duplex apartment in Salem, Oregon, will pay $17,000 under an Initial Decision and Consent Order (""Consent Order"") resolving allegations that they violated the Fair Housing Act by denying a reasonable accommodation request for a woman to live with her assistance animals. Read the Consent Order here. The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination based on disability. Such discrimination includes refusing to rent based on a person’s disability, failing to grant reasonable accommodations, or subjecting tenants to discriminatory terms and conditions. “When a person with disabilities is denied an assistance animal, they are denied equal use and enjoyment of their homes,” said Demetria L. McCain, HUD’s Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. “HUD will continue to work earnestly to ensure that persons with disabilities are not discriminated against.” The settlement stems from a charge HUD filed on February 10, 2023, alleging Respondents Patton and Cave violated the Fair Housing Act when they denied the Complainant’s reasonable accommodation request to waive a no-pet policy to allow her assistance cat and assistance dog, which would help alleviate the symptoms of her disabilities. As alleged in the Charge, the Respondents denied the request in a letter that stated: “We will NOT be changing our rental policy. If you feel that you need this accommodation, then please look for another place to live. We will NOT accept any animals of any kind no questions asked. I will give you a good rental reference if needed.” The Respondent Cave also verbally denied the Complainant’s request, telling her that he would not change the rental policy, would not accept any animals of any kind, and that she should seek new housing if she insisted on an accommodation. The Complainant subsequently vacated the property and moved to a different residence that would allow her to live with her assistance animals. “The Fair Housing Act requires housing providers to make reasonable exceptions to their ordinary policies when necessary for individuals with disabilities to live with their assistance animals,” said Damon Smith, HUD’s General Counsel. “A housing provider’s refusal to do so is a serious violation of the law.” HUD, the Complainant, and the Respondents agreed to voluntarily resolve this matter without a hearing before a HUD Administrative Law Judge. Accordingly, the parties have agreed to the entry of the Consent Order. Under the terms of the Consent Order, the Respondents will pay $17,000 to the Complainant, develop a reasonable accommodation policy that complies with the Fair Housing Act and applies to every property they own or manage, and maintain records of any reasonable accommodation requests they receive. The Respondents denied the allegations but voluntarily agreed to settle the matter. Individuals who believe they have experienced discrimination in housing may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 877-8339 (Federal Relay Service). Housing providers can learn more about their responsibility to provide reasonable accommodations and reasonable modifications to individuals with disabilities here."
"Friday, August 18, 2023",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_176,Federal Housing Agencies Issue Reminder of Mortgage Assistance for Those Impacted by the Maui Wildfires,"WASHINGTON - Today, Federal Housing Agencies - Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae), Federal Housing Administration (FHA), Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), and United States Department of Veterans Affairs (Veterans Affairs) - issued the following joint statement pledging their offices’ ongoing support for Hawaiian residents affected by the devastating wildfires on the Hawaiian island of Maui. Joint Statement from Ginnie Mae, Federal Housing Administration, Federal Housing Finance Agency (Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac), USDA, and Department of Veterans Affairs: “We stand in solidarity with the people of Maui and offer our deepest condolences and sympathies to those who have lost loved ones, homes, businesses, and communities to these devastating fires. As fire suppression and search and rescue efforts continue, federal housing agencies are engaging with state officials and local partners, and in interagency efforts, to monitor the impact to households and the housing sector and ensure awareness of available disaster assistance for homeowners. We are committed to providing homeowners flexibilities and assistance so they feel the security of knowing they will have the option to return and rebuild when it is safe to do so. This community will need all the support it can get, including federal aid and private sector involvement. FHFA through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Department of Veterans Affairs, USDA, Ginnie Mae and FHA have tools to help lenders, servicers, and issuers meet the needs of homeowners in this difficult time. Additionally, USDA and HUD are working to provide assistance and resources to tenants who have been displaced in federally assisted multifamily rental homes, as well as impacted owners and operators.” Homeowners and Renters For homeowners and renters who need immediate housing and disaster recovery assistance, HUD-certified housing counselors are prepared and well-trained to provide guidance on the options that are available to you. To find a HUD-approved housing counseling agency, use our online search tool at hud.gov/findacounselor or use our phone search by calling (800) 569-4287 or (202) 708-1455 (TTY). Homeowners are encouraged to contact their mortgage servicer (the company listed on your mortgage statement) for disaster assistance. If you have a home with a mortgage insured by FHA in the Maui County disaster area and are unable to make your mortgage payments, immediate relief is available. Homeowners are likely to have a range of options that can help them avoid the need to default on their mortgage or to sell their home or land. Contact your mortgage servicer for assistance as soon as practical. Homeowners may also contact the FHA Resource Center at (800) CALL-FHA (1-800-877-8339; or for TTY 1-800-877-8339) for assistance. FHA-Approved Mortgage Servicers Doing Business in Maui County: Servicers should use every permissible means to contact affected homeowners who may need mortgage payment relief. Because of the extensive destruction in Maui and disruption to modes of communication unique to the island, servicers may offer temporary forbearance to borrowers and may provide that forbearance unless the borrower affirmatively declines the offer. FHA’s 90-day moratorium on foreclosures in Maui County started on the date of the Presidentially Declared Major Disaster Area, which was August 10, 2023. Servicers must not initiate new, or continue with existing, foreclosure actions in Maui County during the moratorium. Servicers of Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECMs) must implement a 90-day extension period for all HECMs in the disaster area with unpaid property charges. FHA-approved Mortgage Lenders Doing Business in Maui County We encourage FHA-approved lenders doing business in Maui to prepare to assist homeowners in the coming weeks and months by familiarizing your loan officers and operational teams with FHA’s 203(h) Disaster Mortgage, which provides up to 100 percent financing on a new mortgage to financing rebuilding in the same location, or for the purchase of a home in a new location. Similarly, FHA’s 203(k) program can provide financing or refinancing that includes the cost of structural and non-structural home repairs in one mortgage. For Ginnie Mae Issuers: Ginnie Mae is reaching out to potentially impacted issuers of Ginnie Mae mortgage-backed securities collateralized by loans in Maui County guaranteed or insured by FHA, Veterans Affairs, USDA and rural and tribal programs. We encourage impacted issuers in need of assistance to notify us. Affected issuers may qualify for certain assistance as the full extent of the impacts of this disaster become known over the coming weeks and months. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Backed Mortgages: FHFA, through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, has existing guidelines for single-family mortgages impacted by a natural disaster: Mortgage servicers are authorized to offer a forbearance plan for up to 90 days – even without establishing contact with the homeowner – if the servicer believes the home was affected by the disaster. Homeowners affected by a disaster are often eligible to reduce or suspend their mortgage payments for up to 12 months by entering into a forbearance plan with their mortgage servicer. During this temporary reduction or pause in payments, homeowners will not incur late fees and foreclosure and other legal proceedings are suspended. Following a forbearance plan, there are a number of options available to potentially help homeowners catch up on missed payments, including Disaster Payment Deferral or Flex Modification (https://yourhome.fanniemae.com/get-relief/options-to-stay-in-your-home) The following resources are available for Disaster Impacted Victims: Fannie Mae Check to see if Fannie Mae owns your loan at: www.KnowYourOptions.com/loanlookup Additional assistance?

WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the National Association of Real Estate Brokers (NAREB) unveiled today a partnership aimed at tackling appraisal bias and discrimination in the housing market. This historic collaboration, set to launch in the coming months, will increase education, outreach, and efforts to combat racial appraisal bias in home property valuation. “Owning a home provides a path to the American dream. Yet, Black and Brown people have consistently had their homes under-valued because of racial appraisal bias, locking them out of opportunities to build generational wealth,” said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “This partnership is a bold step toward remedying appraisal discrimination, closing the wealth gap, and achieving racial equity.” The partnership will be officially launched in October 2023 and will include online training for counselors, roundtable discussions on bias and discrimination, educational material distribution, and appraisal-related training. The aim is to promote fairness in the housing market. Specifically, training sessions will include discussion of strategies to combat appraisal bias; best practices for housing counselors to help clients impacted; and available resources that can support housing counselors and their clients. In addition, HUD's Office of Housing Counseling and National Fair Housing Training Academy will work with NAREB on holding regional roundtables across the country to gain greater understanding of appraisal bias in specific geographic areas; build public-private partnerships and collaboration in efforts to combat appraisal bias; and share best practices for housing counselors to help impacted clients. HUD Secretary Fudge serves as the co-chair of PAVE, a first-of-its-kind interagency task force comprised of 13 agencies dedicated to ending bias in home valuation. Since the PAVE Action Plan was announced in March 2022 by the Biden-Harris Administration, the PAVE Task Force has made critical progress. In particular, the Administration’s efforts have included committing to making appraisal data from the Federal Housing Administration available to the public, supporting a well-trained and dynamic appraiser profession and empowering consumers to take actions, such as filing fair housing claims through the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. People who believe they are the victims of housing discrimination should contact HUD at (800) 669-9777 (voice) 800-927-9275 (TTY) or the Department of Justice at (800) 896-7743 or (202) 514-4713. Additional information is available at www.hud.gov/fairhousing and www.justice.gov. Materials and assistance are available for persons with limited English proficiency. Individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing may contact the Department using the Federal Relay Service at (800) 877-8339."

HUD Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary Richard Monocchio joins an August of ""HUD On the Road."" Throughout the month, HUD leadership will travel across the country to invest in and empower local communities to increase the supply of affordable housing through building preservation and innovation. “I am pleased to see Tucson is receiving this Choice Neighborhoods award,” said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “The City of Tucson has demonstrated its commitment to neighborhood revitalization, having collaborated with community members to create a transformation plan for the Tucson House and the Thrive in the 05 neighborhood. This public investment will give the local leaders the resources they need to achieve their vision for The 05.” HUD Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing Richard Monocchio added: “The City of Tucson and its many committed community partners have worked for more than a decade to redevelop the City’s 5th ward. Having undergone a comprehensive local planning effort to redevelop Tucson House and the Thrive in the 05 neighborhood, this $50 million Choice Neighborhood Implementation Grant is a once-in-a-generation investment in the city and the State of Arizona. We’re honored to be part of this special celebration and to provide resources that support the “Thrive in the 5” initiative.” Last week, Secretary Fudge announced the awarding of (CNI) Grants totaling $370 million to seven other communities throughout the country. The Choice Neighborhoods Implementation Grants will help revitalize and transform the distressed public and/or assisted housing and neighborhoods across the country, while also providing residents with services focused on income, health, and education. The CNI Grants fund the creation of new mixed-income housing communities, improve economic development opportunities, and support wide-scale community revitalization efforts that focus on the three areas of “Housing, People, and Neighborhood.” The new grantees will join a committed group of 44 other Choice Neighborhoods sites nationwide that have collectively invested more than $6.3 billion into historically disinvested communities. The eight new awards have leveraged an additional $3 billion in public and private commitments to make their larger Transformation Plan a reality. “HUD on the Road” aims to make HUD more accessible, supporting those in need while enhancing wealth-building and homeownership opportunities for all Americans. As HUD leaders travel nationwide, engaging with local communities, they strive to create a brighter and more inclusive future, fostering a stronger nation that provides housing and economic opportunities to every individual."

HUD is taking two actions to increase the supply of affordable housing: making available $85 million in competitive grants for housing production and preservation, and providing public housing authorities and multifamily housing owners in the Rental Assistance Demonstration with new tools to repair and build affordable housing. HUD is taking three actions to further protections in housing. First, HUD is sending messages to public housing agencies and property owners to remind them of best practices. Second, HUD is making $10 million available to support renters through tenant education and outreach. Third, HUD will soon announce a proposed rule to provide more time for eviction notification.

The housing measures announced Thursday include providing communities with $85 million in funding from the Department of Housing and Urban Development to reduce barriers to affordable housing, such as zoning restrictions that in some places have become a hurdle to increasing the supply and density of affordable housing. HUD would provide grants upwards of $10 million. “HUD recognizes that communities have unique housing challenges and that’s why the resources announced today are not one-size-fits-all,” HUD Secretary Marcia Fudge said in a statement.

Reuters: Biden administration moves to boost housing supply, improve renter protections Andrea Shalal WASHINGTON, July 27 (Reuters) - The Biden administration on Thursday continued its push to drive down housing prices, announcing steps to reduce zoning and land-use restrictions that often constrain housing construction, especially in low-income areas, and better protect renters. The moves, which will also expand financing for affordable, energy efficient and resilient housing and promote commercial-to-residential conversion opportunities, are part of a big White House push to boost the supply of affordable housing.

WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is taking two actions to lower housing costs for Americans by increasing the supply of affordable housing. HUD’s actions today will make it easier to build new housing and providing new tools for preserving and improving deeply affordable housing. An $85 million first-of-its-kind competitive PRO Housing funding opportunity for jurisdictions and new guidance for providers of affordable housing will help communities address local housing challenges. The White House released a factsheet highlighting the “Actions to Lower Housing Costs and Boost Supply,” available here. “HUD recognizes that communities have unique housing challenges and that’s why the resources announced today are not one size fits all. HUD is proud to highlight the efforts of communities who are committed to housing-forward policies and practices and through PRO Housing we hope to support them with funding as well,” said Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “Today, we are acting to increase the supply of affordable housing, which is crucial to lowering housing costs. We look forward to continuing this work in partnership with local communities.” First, HUD is announcing the availability of $85 million innovative competitive grants for communities to identify and remove barriers to affordable housing production and preservation. A first of its kind program, Pathways to Removing Obstacles to Housing (PRO Housing) will help communities further develop, evaluate, and implement housing policy plans; address restrictive zoning, land use, or regulatory policies; improve housing strategies; and facilitate affordable housing production and preservation. Grants to local governments, states, metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs), and multijurisdictional entities will range from $1 million to $10 million. Second, HUD is also providing public housing authorities and multifamily housing owners participating in the Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) with new tools to repair and build affordable housing. Released today, HUD’s supplemental RAD notice provides additional flexibilities for housing providers that will enhance RAD’s ability to support repairs to thousands of affordable homes over the next three years. The notice also promotes water- and energy-efficiency investments and includes new requirements that address climate resilience and adopt stronger energy efficiency standards. Additionally, the notice provides $12 million to support preservation transactions of eligible housing for the elderly. Today’s actions follow through on commitments made by the Biden-Harris Administration in its Housing Supply Action Plan, with the key objective of lowering the cost of housing for all Americans. These actions build on progress already made by HUD, including reviving the Risk Sharing program, that has so far supported the preservation and creation of 12,000 affordable homes since its restart, and providing communities with $5 billion for the through HOME-ARP program, which will create over 20,000 new affordable homes for people experiencing homelessness, facing housing insecurity, fleeing domestic violence, and veterans."
"Thursday, July 27, 2023",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_150,HUD Affirms Renter Protections and Releases $10 Million Funding Opportunity for Tenant Education and Outreach,"Protections and funding build on commitments made by the Biden-Harris Administration’s Blueprint for a Renters Bill of Rights Announcement made at HUD’s “National Conversation at the Community Table” with tenants and renters from across the United States WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is announcing three new actions to increase fairness in the rental market and further renter protections in housing. The White House released a fact sheet highlighting actions to protect renters, available here. First, HUD is sending messages to public housing agencies and property owners to remind them of their obligations and to share best practices for informing rejected applicants about why they were turned down for housing. This action makes the rental screening process more transparent and gives renters greater ability to correct any errors that may occur. Second, HUD is supporting renters by making available $10 million for tenant education and outreach in properties supported by the Section 8 Project-Based Rental Assistance program. Such funding is critical to supporting capacity building efforts that enable tenants to better engage with property management and help sustain safe, clean, and quality affordable housing. Third, HUD is announcing that it will soon issue a proposed rule addressing notification requirements for evictions due to nonpayment of rent in certain subsidized housing properties. Under this proposed rule, when tenants face eviction for nonpayment of rent in public housing and properties with project-based rental assistance, housing providers would need to provide those tenants with written notification at least 30 days prior to lease termination. These actions advance commitments made in the Blueprint for a Renters Bill of Rights released by the Biden-Harris Administration early this year. “We must provide renters with the necessary resources to safeguard their interests and enhance their communication with landlords,” said Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “HUD is dedicated to collaborating with renters and ensuring they are well informed about their rights.” Over 44 million households, or roughly 35 percent of the U.S. population, live in rental housing. HUD and the Biden Harris Administration has laid out its plan to support renters and their ability to live with dignity and agency. As a part of that commitment, HUD has made meaningful conversation and engagement with tenant leaders about its policies a priority. On Tuesday, HUD Deputy Secretary Adrianne Todman hosted the “National Conversation @ The Community Table”, an opportunity for tenants, advocates, and stakeholder organizations to engage in dialogue about the principles within the White House Blueprint for a Renters Bill of Rights as well as share recommendations regarding additional commitments that they believe would be helpful to communities across the country. Additional information about the actions taken today include: HUD Adverse Action Notice. HUD program offices sent messages encouraging public housing authorities and multifamily-assisted property owners to include adverse action notices in writing as part of the denial letter that they are required to send when applicants are denied due to issues flagged on tenant screening reports or other background checks. Other agencies, including the Federal Housing Finance Agency and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, joined HUD in sending out messages to owners and operators of federally assisted or financed housing that they oversee about their obligations under FCRA. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission issued updated guidance for landlords on how to comply with FCRA, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau shared a blog highlighting agencies’ actions and the importance of giving tenants the opportunity to discover and correct issues contained in tenant screening reports. $10 Million for Tenant Outreach and Education. With this new funding that supports tenant education and outreach in properties supported by the Section 8 Project-Based Rental Assistance (PBRA) program, HUD reaffirms the Biden Administration’s commitment to quality affordable rental housing and strong tenant protections. The program aims to engage tenants in efforts to preserve eligible properties as affordable housing, and to provide tenants with information on their rights and responsibilities. Funding can be used for training and technical assistance as well as to help establish tenant organizations and support their ongoing operations. Applications must be submitted by October 23, 2023. Providing more time for tenants to avoid eviction. HUD has committed to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking that would require that tenants of public housing and properties with project-based rental assistance receive a written notice at least 30 days prior to lease termination for nonpayment of rent. This proposed rule would curtail preventable and unnecessary evictions by providing tenants time and information to help address nonpayment violations. Tenants living in public housing and in properties with project-based rental assistance are already entitled to receive a 30 day notice in cases of non-payment of rent. However, if finalized, the proposed rule would permanently memorialize this requirement in HUD’s regulations, allowing the agency additional latitude to effectively communicate and implement these protections. As part of the rulemaking process, tenants and other parties will also be able to provide their comments and perspectives to help HUD make sure this rule assists with preventable evictions."

"Monday, July 3, 2023",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_23_133,Secretary Fudge Announces Homelessness Funding to be Available in July,"WASHINGTON - The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) will soon issue a Notice of Funding Opportunity to provide approximately $3.1 billion under the Continuum of Care (CoC) program—the largest-ever single-year investment through this program to help communities address homelessness. HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge announced this funding opportunity during her trip to Hawaii, where Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders face the highest rate of homelessness in the nation at 121 per 10,000 people. The funds will support efforts by Continuums of Care, nonprofit providers, States, Indian Tribes or Tribally Designated Housing Entities, and local governments to quickly rehouse homeless individuals; families; veterans and their families; persons fleeing domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking; and youth while minimizing the trauma and dislocation caused by homelessness. The program will also promote access to and effective utilization of affordable housing programs and other health and supportive services by homeless individuals and families. “This largest ever $3.1 billion investment in the Continuum of Care program is an important step in the fight against homelessness,” said Secretary Fudge. “Investments in local organizations that can connect people experiencing homelessness to permanent housing and address their services needs is a part of the solution and must be coupled with efforts to prevent homelessness and to increase the supply of affordable housing. HUD will continue to demonstrate its commitment to creating affordable housing for homeless individuals and families here in Hawaii and across the country.” This increase in annual funding reflects the Biden-Harris Administration’s ongoing commitment to address the nation’s homelessness crisis with the urgency it requires and builds on other HUD efforts to address homelessness. From Day One, the Biden-Harris Administration has made addressing homelessness a top priority, including historic investments in the American Rescue Plan in the form of Emergency Housing Vouchers and special HOME Investment Partnerships-ARP grants. As the Administration’s first Chair of the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH), Secretary Fudge launched House America, partnering with state and local leaders from 105 states and communities to collectively rehouse over 100,000 households experiencing homelessness and add over 40,000 new units of deeply affordable and supportive housing into the development pipeline. Under Secretary Fudge’s leadership, USICH developed All In: the Biden-Harris Administration’s Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness, which is the most ambitious effort by any administration to assist people currently experiencing homelessness, prevent people from becoming homeless, address inequities that disproportionately impact underserved communities, and help cities and states reduce unsheltered homelessness. The Administration has begun implementing All In. Earlier this year, HUD released a first-of-its-kind package of grants totaling $486 million and approximately 3,300 housing vouchers to help 62 communities address unsheltered homelessness and homeless encampments. Just last month, the Administration launched the ALL INside initiative, through which the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH) and its 19 federal member agencies will partner with state and local governments to strengthen and accelerate local efforts to get unsheltered people into homes in six places: Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, Phoenix Metro, Seattle, and the State of California. These recent steps are on top of President Biden’s American Rescue Plan (ARP)— the largest single-year investment in ending homelessness in U.S. history—which helped prevent a surge of homelessness during 2021, as reflected in the 2022 Point-in-Time count. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

HUD understands the ongoing threat climate change poses to the country and world – because this crisis disproportionately impacts the people we serve. Accordingly, HUD has a responsibility to advance our climate action program by providing tools, opportunities and incentives for partners and stakeholders across the nation to advance a climate-resilient, energy-efficient future. To help build a more sustainable, equitable, and resilient future for the communities we serve, HUD is implementing a holistic, ambitious, Department-wide Climate Action Plan. HUD’s Climate Action Plan aims to increase community climate resilience, reduce greenhouse gas emissions from HUD-supported properties, and embed environmental justice across the Department’s program delivery. Since the Action Plan was released, HUD has made significant strides towards our climate resiliency and energy goals in the following ways: Advancing climate resilience in our most vulnerable communities: • HUD’s Office of Community Planning and Development (CPD), in February 2023, kicked off the Climate Communities Initiative, a pilot technical assistance program designed to support Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) entitlement communities over an 18-month period with their planning and implementation of longterm equitable climate resilience activities and their efforts to better integrate equitable climate resilience into HUD Consolidated Plan and Annual Action Plans. • CPD also published a Community Resilient Toolkit and accompanying implementation guides, including on how to use HUD funding to install cool roofs, to invest in naturebased solutions for people and the planet, to assist communities in designing and implementing a community-driven relocation program and to do single-family retrofits for energy efficiency and resilience. • HUD’s Office of Disaster Recovery published a Resilient Building Codes Toolkit to help Community Development Block Grants for Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) grantees incorporate resilient building codes in their recovery and mitigation efforts. • HUD has also included new climate and environmental justice-related requirements for CDBG-DR funds allocated for 2020 disasters and beyond that will prioritize long-term environmental resilience and traditionally marginalized populations. • HUD published on March 24, 2023, a proposed Federal Flood Risk Management Standard Rule for public comment, proposing for adoption a forward-looking standard that considers future flood risk, increasing the Nation’s resilience to flooding, reducing the risk of flood loss, minimizing the impact of floods on households across the country, and protecting federal investments against future risk and increased harm. Ensuring that resilient HUD-supported housing is energy efficient, with reduced carbon emissions: • HUD’s Supportive Housing for the Elderly Program (Section 202), published a Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) in September 2022, that awarded points for projects that incorporate green and resilient building approaches and outcomes. More stringent energy standards are now required for baseline new construction and substantial rehabilitation with extra points awarded for those projects that lead to deeper energy efficiency and building decarbonization. • HUD’s Office of Public and Indian Housing (PIH) published the updated Small Frozen Rolling Base Notice in October 20222 that provides incentives for small and rural housing authorities to invest in energy and water savings measures that can be financed up to 20 years. • PIH also published the updated Rate Reduction Incentive Notice in November 2022 providing incentive for housing authorities to keep 50 to 100% of savings from significant measures to reduce utility rates. The Office of Public Housing and Voucher Programs Energy Branch created and published technical assistance for PHAs and stakeholders to improve utilization of Energy Performance Contract and Rate Reduction Incentive programs. This year, as a result, HUD has seen a 25% increase in participation of the Rate Reduction program and expects it to increase. • HUD’s Office of Multifamily Housing and PIH published guidance in July and August 2022 that allows residents of public and HUD-assisted multifamily housing to access cost-saving community solar subscriptions, once not eligible for HUD housing, without otherwise affecting their housing assistance. Committing to embedding environmental justice considerations across HUD programs: • HUD’s Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes and PIH announced a pair of historic Notices of Funding Opportunities (NOFOs) in January 2023 totaling $586 million, that will make homes healthier and safer for low-income families by protecting children, families, and individuals from exposure to lead and other hazards in their homes. • HUD’s Office of Environment and Energy published its Draft Departmental Radon Policy, Departmental Policy for Addressing Radon in the Environmental Review Process, in the Federal Register on January 2023 for a 60-day comment period. In recognition that radon is the leading cause of lung cancer in non-smokers and kills an estimated 21,000 Americans each year, HUD seeks to protect resident lives by considering radon as part of the contamination analysis of HUD projects. This draft policy would clarify that radon must be considered in the contamination analysis for HUD environmental reviews; provide guidance on recommended best practices for considering radon; and identify the HUD programs that have established specific radon guidance. • HUD’s Office of Disaster Recovery published the Citizen Participation and Equitable Engagement Toolkit to aid CDBG-DR grantees in centering equity in disaster recovery programs through an enhanced citizen participation process. Building interagency partnerships to advance climate resilience, decarbonization, and environmental justice across the country: • HUD partnered with the Department of Energy (DOE), Department of Transportation DOT, and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to release the U.S. National Blueprint for Transportation Decarbonization to cut all greenhouse emissions from the transportation sector by 2050. This partnership exemplifies the Biden-Harris Administration’s whole-of-government approach to addressing the climate crisis and meeting President Biden’s goals of securing a 100% clean electrical grid by 2035 and reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. HUD’s role in this effort is to help better align transportation, housing, and community development investments. • HUD partners with DOE to support the Better Buildings Multifamily Sector, helping mission-driven owners of primarily affordable multifamily portfolios create approaches to significant energy reductions that can then be scaled across the entire multifamily housing stock. In February 2022, HUD worked with DOE to launch and recruit multifamily partners for the new Better Climate Challenge, in which partners commit to reduce their portfolio-wide greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent over ten years. Fourteen multifamily organizations have now committed to this ambition emissions reduction goal, representing over 100,000 units of housing nationwide -- 75 percent of which are affordable. • HUD has also partnered with DOE to promote the Buildings Upgrade Prize, Buildings UP, an initiative by the DOE Building Technologies Office to build capacity to accelerate equitable, widespread energy efficiency and efficient electrification building upgrades across the country. HUD has promoted this prize opportunity among HUD stakeholders, working to ensure low-income communities are included in the energy transition. Overall, Buildings UP provides more than $22 million in cash prizes and technical assistance to support the transformation of existing U.S. buildings into more energy efficient and clean energy-ready homes, commercial spaces, and communities. Investing in internal training and learning opportunities for HUD staff to gain important knowledge on climate change and environmental justice issues: • HUD’s internal Climate and Environmental Justice Working Group, led by the Senior Advisor for Climate and the Office of Environment and Energy, is focused on the longterm integration of climate action and environmental justice into the Department’s programs to better achieve HUD’s mission, both through implementation of the Department’s Climate Action Plan and by raising awareness around HUD’s climate and environmental justice efforts. The group has met monthly since 2021 and is comprised of nearly 100 members at varying levels of hierarchy from across the Department. • HUD’s Office of Housing hosted housing counseling trainings with DOE to train HUD’s housing counselors about the key role of energy efficiency in boosting housing affordability and improving health, safety and comfort. The trainings also included the value of incentive programs, loan products, rebates, and other resources to help renters, homebuyers, and homeowners achieve cost savings and build wealth through energy efficiency and guidance on how to navigate federal, state and local programs in their region, including various Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) initiatives. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

The loan guarantee, offered through the Section 108 Loan Guarantee Program (Section 108), will be used to finance the construction of approximately 12,000 linear feet (2.3 miles) of sidewalks, including curbs and gutters, in six communities in designated Special Emphasis Neighborhoods whose residents are primarily low- and moderate-income persons (LMI). “Solid, well-built infrastructure is the cornerstone of healthy, sustainable communities,” said Marion McFadden, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary, Office of Community Planning and Development at HUD. “By providing this loan guarantee, HUD keeps Greenville families safe and builds strong structures for their businesses. This project shows how HUD can provide low- and middle-income communities with impactful, broad investments into their public services.” This project will provide funding to six Greenville neighborhoods: Arcadia Hills, Greenline-Spartanburg, Nicholtown, Pleasant Valley, Southernside, and West Greenville. It aligns with the City of Greenville’s Consolidated Plan, which describes a continued need for public improvements, such as sidewalks, in the City’s Special Emphasis Neighborhoods. Section 108 provides states and communities with low-cost, long-term financing for economic and community development projects that primarily benefit low- and moderate-income persons. Section 108 can be used for a variety of projects, such as housing, infrastructure, and other physical development projects. The flexibility of the program makes it an attractive and effective tool for states and local governments that receive funding under the Community Development Block Grant program. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all. More information about HUD and its programs is available at www.hud.gov and https://espanol.hud.gov. You can also follow HUD on Twitter and Facebook or sign up for news alerts on HUD's Email List.
