"Thursday, August 22, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_215,HUD Announces $3.7 Million for Home Repairs for Seniors,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today awarded more than $3.7 million to two nonprofit organizations and a local housing authority to enable low-income elderly persons to remain in their homes through low-cost, low barrier, high impact home modifications. These modifications will reduce older adults’ risk of falling, improve general safety, increase accessibility, and improve their functional abilities in their home. This is the second round of funding this year for HUD’s Older Adults Home Modification Program (OAHMP), in addition to the grants announced on April 9, 2024. President Biden and Vice President Harris believe that all Americans deserve access to a safe, affordable home, and today’s actions advance the Administration’s goal to provide new funding and support to house low-income seniors. “Today, we are furthering our commitment to improving the quality of life for older adults of limited means,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “These grants provide a critical resource to communities to make low-cost, high impact home repairs tailored to the needs of the residents.” “There is a strong connection between health and housing,” said Matthew Ammon, Director of HUD’s Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes. “It is important that our homes stay safe, healthy, and easy to live in, and this program does that, empowering older adults to age in place with dignity.” Grants through OAHMP assist in allowing organizations and housing authorities to adopt comprehensive programs that make safety and functional home modifications to meet the needs of low-income elderly homeowners. These investments will enable older adults to remain in their homes – to “age in place” – rather than move to nursing homes or other assisted care facilities. The grantees, which are experienced in providing services to seniors, will deliver home modification services to more than 525 senior families in both urban communities and communities with substantial rural populations. The following is a state-by-state breakdown of the funding announced today: ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Wednesday, August 21, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_213,"HUD Celebrates 50 Years of Investing in Communities, Helping Families Access Affordable Housing, and Ensuring Safe and Affordable Manufactured Homes","WASHINGTON - This week, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) commemorates the 50th anniversary of the Housing and Community Development (HCD) Act of 1974, which created several programs—including the Housing Choice Voucher program, the Project Based Rental Assistance program and Community Block Development Grant program—to provide access to quality, safe, affordable homes for all. Collectively, these programs ensure families have access to affordable housing. The legislation also included the Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards Act, creating what is commonly referred to as the HUD Code, which maintains national standards for safe, durable, efficient and affordable manufactured homes. Under the Biden-Harris Administration, HUD continues to expand these successful programs in alignment with the President’s goals to lower housing costs for all Americans and reduce barriers to affordable housing. “Like President Biden, and Vice President Harris, I believe there is nothing Americans can’t do when we do it together. The groundbreaking programs we are celebrating today have provided affordable housing to countless Americans in urban, suburban, and rural communities. These programs demonstrate that when we act boldly, we meaningfully improve people’s daily lives,” said Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “We also know there is more to be done and that is why this Administration has proposed ambitious new housing investments and we call on Congress to act to help people with current high housing costs.” On August 22, 1974, the HCD Act was signed into law, to provide the foundations for better housing for all Americans and boost the long-range prospects a robust domestic housing market. The 1974 Act helped build the nation’s largest housing programs to meet the needs of lower income households. These programs include: The Housing Choice Voucher program (tenant-based Section 8), which unlocked existing privately owned rental housing for very low-income families, now serves more than 2.3 million households. The Project Based Rental Assistance program (project-based Section 8), which provided subsidy for private developers to build housing to serve very low-income households, now serves more than 1.3 million households. The legislation of 1974 also created the Community Block Development Grant (CDBG), a resource for more than 1,000 local communities to address several community development needs, including rehabilitating housing and upgrading aging infrastructure. Through CDBG-Disaster Recovery, more than $100 billion has been used since 1992 to help communities across America manage long-term recovery needs after extreme weather events and major disasters. The legislation also authorized the creation of a nationwide performance-based building code for manufactured housing, which simultaneously improved the safety of new manufactured housing, improved efficiency of mass production and reduced construction costs. Today, the Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards, commonly known as the “HUD Code,” remains the preemptive federal standard for ensuring that manufactured housing – which houses more than 20 million Americans – remain safe, durable, and affordable. In the past three years, HUD has ensured the safe and affordable production of approximately 360,000 manufactured homes that adhere to the HUD Code. Under the Biden-Harris Administration, HUD is not only celebrating the programs, but it is also investing in making them better: Working to permanently authorize the CDBG-Disaster Recovery Program to more expeditiously and efficiently help communities recover. HUD, through the Biden-Harris Administration, is simultaneously seeking to permanently authorize the CDBG-DR program while also issuing a “Universal Notice,” which would significantly improve the transparency, predictability, and efficacy of these funds directed to impacted communities. Taking extensive steps to strengthen, streamline, and expand the Housing Choice Voucher program to help families find affordable housing. Under the Biden-Harris Administration, the program has seen its largest expansion in 20 years, including 70,000 Emergency Housing Vouchers and 20,000 new fair share vouchers. The Biden-Harris Administration has also implemented the biggest program regulatory updates since 1996, including changes to make it easier to transition homeless Americans into permanent housing. HUD has also increased maximum voucher rents to ensure that voucher holders can better compete for units in markets where rents are rising. In addition, President Biden’s 2025 Budget proposes $32.8 billion for the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) Program, which will provide housing for 2.3 million individuals and families, including funds for new vouchers to help 20,000 more low-income individuals and families find and afford housing. The President’s budget also proposes $7.5 billion to create new project-based rental assistance at a scale not seen in decades. Making HUD-assisted homes more resilient than ever. Under the Biden-Harris Administration’s Green and Resilient Retrofit Program, HUD is helping to finance energy efficiency and climate resilience measures at more than 170 properties participating in its Multifamily project-based rental assistance programs, rehabilitating the rental homes of more than 20,000 individuals and families to make them more energy efficient and climate resilient. Proposing critical and consistent updates to the HUD Code to ensure manufactured homes are safe, quality places to live. During the Biden-Harris Administration, HUD has raised the importance of Manufactured Housing through creation of a new Office of Manufactured Housing Programs. This Administration implemented a large HUD code update in 2021 that included provisions for attached manufactured homes (townhome style), attached garages and carports, and included requirements for carbon monoxide alarms for homes with gas appliances among other changes., HUD has proposed, and is soon finalizing, one of the largest updates to the HUD Code in more than three decades. In addition to making changes that will increase the quality, sustainability, and resilience of manufactured homes, the new rule would enable single family multi-unit homes to be built under the HUD Code for the first time, extending the cost-saving benefits of manufactured housing to denser urban and suburban infill settings. HUD’s Office of Policy Development and Research is publishing a number of research papers looking back at the Housing Choice Voucher and the Community Development Block Grant programs over the past 50 years with their Summer and Fall editions of Cityscape. The Housing Choice Voucher program edition is currently available, and the Community Development Block Grant edition which will publish in November. In addition, HUD has published a research roadmap for offsite construction of housing that looks back at HUD’s role over the past 50 years. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Friday, August 16, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_210,"Two Years After Signage of President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, HUD is Creating More Affordable, Energy Efficient and Climate Resilient Homes for Renters","WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is commemorating the two-year anniversary of President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, the largest investment in clean energy and climate action ever, which was signed into law by President Biden on August 16, 2022. By advancing the Biden-Harris Administration’s ambitious climate agenda, the Inflation Reduction Act is helping families save money on housing, energy bills, protecting them from climate-fueled disasters such as storms, floods, fire, and extreme heat, and creating hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs. “Under the Biden-Harris Administration, HUD has delivered hundreds of millions of dollars in Inflation Reduction Act funding to help tens of thousands of families across the country by supporting green energy and climate resilience upgrades to their homes,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “Today's announcement will add to HUD's continued efforts to repair homes across the country, ensuring residents have access to safe, sustainable, affordable housing.” Through the Inflation Reduction Act, HUD received nearly one billion dollars to create grants and loans to increase energy efficiency and climate resilience at HUD’s assisted rental properties. HUD’s Green and Resilient Retrofit Program (GRRP) has already awarded $773 million to projects across the country, helping HUD-assisted properties representing more than 20,000 rental homes for low-income tenants. This investment creates healthier, affordable, safer and more climate resilient homes and communities and advances economic and environmental justice, a core value of the Biden-Harris Administration’s work related to climate change. GRRP is the first HUD program to simultaneously invest in energy efficiency, greenhouse gas emissions reductions, energy generation, green and healthy housing, and climate resilience strategies specifically in HUD-assisted multifamily housing. All the investments under the GRRP will be made in affordable housing communities serving low-income families in alignment with the President’s Justice40 Initiative which sets a goal that 40% of the overall benefits of certain federal investments flow to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized by underinvestment and overburdened by pollution. The Inflation Reduction Act provided HUD with $837.5 million in grant and loan subsidy funding and $4 billion in loan commitment authority for this program. “Thanks to its IRA funding, the Green and Resilient Retrofit Program is enabling energy efficiency and climate resilience upgrades in the homes of those who for too long have been overlooked when it comes to investments in safe and sustainable housing,” said Assistant Secretary for Housing and Federal Housing Commissioner Julia Gordon. “The Green and Resilient Retrofit Program shows the power of federal funding under the Biden-Harris Administration to make a real and lasting difference for residents, for communities, and for the planet.” The President’s Inflation Reduction Act also funds HUD’s Multifamily Benchmarking Initiative, which provides no-cost benchmarking services for owners of eligible HUD-assisted properties to assess their energy and water consumption to determine what efficiency upgrades are needed and how to reduce utility and housing costs. To date, more than 900 properties are participating in this initiative in support of efforts to lower energy costs while promoting climate resilience and sustainability and housing affordability in the nation’s housing supply. In addition to encouraging participating properties to increase efficiency through comprehensive retrofits, this effort supports the Biden-Harris Administration’s ongoing efforts to build and preserve more affordable, multifamily housing. In addition, in September 2023, HUD launched its first-ever Funding Navigator, an interactive tool that allows the user to browse and sort funding opportunities for billions of dollars in funding available under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL). As a part of President Biden’s Investing in America agenda, potentially eligible entities are able to sort funding resources based on audience, activity, funding type, location, and other items. The Funding Navigator helps HUD program participants maximize the utilization of IRA and BIL resources for carbon reduction and climate resilience efforts. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Thursday, August 15, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_209,HUD’s National Fair Housing Training Academy Partners with International Association of Official Human Rights Agencies,"WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced a renewed partnership between its National Fair Housing Training Academy (NFHTA) and the International Association of Official Human Rights Agencies (IAOHRA) at this week’s 2024 IAOHRA conference in St. Louis, MO. Commemorating NFHTA’s 20th anniversary and IAOHRA’s 75th anniversary, this partnership marks a growing relationship between the Federal government, and civil rights, fair housing, and human rights stakeholders. During the St. Louis conference, HUD’s NFHTA offered one of its foundational training courses on intake for fair housing practitioners who currently receive funding from HUD’s Fair Housing Assistance Program (FHAP) or are interested in pursuing FHAP funding. “Through close collaboration with partners like IAOHRA, HUD is ensuring that together, we multiply the support and resources we can offer to communities across the country,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “We are working every day to increase fair access to affordable homes for all and protect residents from housing discrimination.” “HUD’s partnerships with state and local civil rights agencies through the Fair Housing Assistance Program are critical to fair housing enforcement,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, Diane M. Shelley. “I am pleased that we could offer specific training at the IAOHRA Conference and we will continue to provide these opportunities in the future.” This partnership follows HUD’s announcement this past May awarding $26 million in non-competitive funding to state and local fair housing enforcement agencies across the country under the Fair Housing Assistance Program. Formed 20 years ago, HUD’s NFHTA builds skills and capacity for HUD-funded partners to end housing discrimination through timely, thorough, and comprehensive investigation of fair housing cases. NFHTA will commemorate its 20th anniversary throughout the next year by highlighting achievements and looking ahead to the next twenty years of building capacity to root out all forms of discrimination in housing. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Wednesday, August 14, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_208,HUD Partners With More Than 25 Federal Agencies in Coordinated Fight Against Extreme Heat and Climate Change,"HUD joins the National Integrated Heat Health Information System to build awareness about the dangers of extreme heat and develop solutions to reduce the negative impacts of extreme heat on communities throughout the country. WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development is joining the White House and interagency National Integrated Heat Health Information System (NIHHIS) to highlight the first ever National Heat Strategy for 2024-2030. A whole-of-government response to historic and dangerous heat due to climate change, the national plan is a framework for agencies to develop science-based solutions to reduce the impacts of extreme heat. “The dangerous impact of extreme heat on American communities – particularly hurting our most vulnerable residents, is undeniable,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “HUD is working to create resilient, sustainable, healthy, and inclusive communities for all to ensure the households we serve are protected from extreme heat hazards.” Extreme heat and climate change are a generational threat. The hottest August on record was in 2023, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that in the United States, 1,220 people die from extreme heat each year. Crucially, extreme heat affects the most vulnerable among us, including those living in historically underserved communities. The National Heat Strategic Plan builds on additional recent federal efforts, including the National Resilience Strategy, the National Climate Resilience Framework and the National Resilience Guidance, to embed resilience into planning and management within the federal government and across the country. Throughout the Biden-Harris Administration, and as part of the collective approach across the government, HUD has devoted significant efforts to supporting families, vulnerable individuals, and the housing market against the negative effects of extreme heat. In July, HUD convened its first ever Insurance Summit during which industry executives, government leaders, nonprofits, and academics addressed the rising cost of property insurance and solutions to mitigate the impact on communities across the country. In June, HUD released new guidance to Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) to reduce the threat of extreme heat for residents. This guidance provides families with relief during periods of severe or extreme heat, helping them afford to cool their homes. These new options allow Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) to increase utility allowances for residents or waive surcharges for cooling, enabling residents to use air conditioning during extreme heat. This guidance not only safeguards the safety and health of families but also lowers home energy costs for residents in public housing by making it easier to request relief for excess utility expenses. In April, HUD published a webpage on Extreme Heat that serves as a hub highlighting actions communities can take to prepare and respond to extreme heat events and resources to help fund climate resilience projects. HUD will continue the work to ensure that all Americans have access to sustainable and healthy homes resilient to the growing dangers of extreme heat and climate change. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Wednesday, August 14, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_207,Biden-Harris Administration Awards Nearly $140 Million to Expand Affordable Housing for People with Disabilities,"Funding supports efforts by 18 state housing agencies to create affordable homes and expand support services for adults living with disabilities. WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development awarded $138.5 million in grants for more than a dozen state housing agencies to expand the supply of housing and supportive services for low-income persons with disabilities across America. Funding made possible by HUD’s Section 811 Project Rental Assistance (PRA) for Persons with Disabilities program will allow 18 state housing agencies to develop strategies to identify and refer low-income persons with disabilities to eligible homes, and to provide them with rental assistance and supportive services. Today’s announcement advances the Biden-Harris Administration’s goals to reduce housing costs, boost supply, and expand access to affordable housing for low-income families, veterans and persons with disabilities. “Under the Biden-Harris Administration, we are committed to removing barriers to housing and ensuring that everyone has access to an accessible, quality, and affordable home that meets their needs,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “Today’s awards will support Americans with disabilities by both creating affordable housing and expanding crucial support services.” Awardees will work to address long-term housing security and affordability issues for persons with disabilities within existing, new, or renovated multifamily developments and facilitate community integration. In collaboration with Medicaid and/or health and human services agencies, awardees will also connect individuals with community-based support and services for the long-term. “Adults with disabilities often face significant barriers in securing a safe and stable place to live,” said Assistant Secretary for Housing and Federal Housing Commissioner Julia Gordon. “These awards create opportunities for more housing that’s available, accessible, and inclusive.” The following grantees received awards: About the Section 811 Program Through the Section 811 Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities program, HUD provides funding to develop and subsidize rental housing with the availability of supportive services for very low- and extremely low-income adults with disabilities. The program also enables persons with disabilities to live as independently as possible in their community and provides access to appropriate supportive services. The program is authorized to operate in two ways: the Project Rental Assistance Program (PRA) and the Capital Advance Program. The Section 811 PRA program identifies, stimulates, and supports innovative state-level strategies that will transform and increase housing for extremely low-income persons (those earning 30 percent or less of area median income) with disabilities while also making available appropriate support and services. HUD intends to support collaborations between State Housing and Health and Human Service/Medicaid Agencies that will create or increase access to affordable permanent supportive housing units – new and existing – with access to appropriate services. The Section 811 Capital Advance program aims to expand the supply of integrated affordable housing by providing Capital Advance funding for the development of permanent supportive rental housing for very-low-income (those earning 50 percent or less of the area median income) with disabilities who are 18 years of age or older and less than 62 years of age at entry. The program also provides project rental subsidies in the form of a Project Rental Assistance Contract (PRAC) to maintain ongoing affordability over at least the next forty years. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Tuesday, August 13, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_205,Biden-Harris Administration Announces Funding for Communities to Build More Affordable Homes and Lower Housing Costs,"HUD announces $100 million in new PRO Housing funding to cut red tape to housing production, and launches $250 million challenge for transformative housing investments WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced the availability of $100 million in competitive grant funding to cut red tape, build more homes, and lower the costs of renting and buying a home. Through HUD’s Pathways to Removing Obstacles to Housing (PRO Housing) program, communities across the nation are eligible to apply for funding to remove barriers to local housing production. Today’s announcement is part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s whole-of-government work to build more homes and lower housing costs, as outlined in today’s White House fact sheet. It builds upon actions taken through the Biden-Harris Administration’s Housing Supply Action Plan and HUD’s Strategic Plan to increase housing supply, lower costs for families, ensure equitable development, and build climate resilient, sustainable communities. “This funding is designed to cut red tape, and make sure that we’re building more homes, especially affordable homes, with urgency because people need help now,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “The Biden-Harris Administration has made it a priority to reduce housing costs by increasing our nation’s housing supply and our partnerships with local communities are critical to achieving this goal. A first of its kind program, PRO Housing helps communities continue to address restrictive land use or regulatory policies; improve and implement housing strategies; and facilitate the construction of new housing and repairs to existing homes and cut energy costs. Grants to local governments, states, metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs), and multijurisdictional entities will range from $1 million to $7 million. The Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) announced today is the second round of the PRO Housing competition. Earlier this summer, HUD awarded $85 million to communities across 19 States and the District of Columbia. Winners of the PRO Housing competition will update state and local housing plans, revise land use policies, streamline the permitting process for housing construction, and take other actions to create more housing-forward communities. Grants will also be used to preserve existing affordable housing units, provide development subsidies to create new affordable units, and increase access to homeownership. Common barriers to housing identified in the round one PRO Housing applications include the high cost of land and development, lack of available units, underutilized vacant land and property, aging housing stock, inadequate infrastructure, displacement pressures, risks of climate-fueled extreme weather or environment hazards, high energy costs, and outdated land-use and permitting policies and processes. “The communities who were awarded PRO Housing funding are already doing incredible work to modernize local policies, invest in communities, and build more homes. What makes this program unique is its ability to support and accelerate locally-driven planning, implementation, and development efforts,” said Marion McFadden, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development. “Round two of the competition prioritizes communities with acute need for affordable housing that have already demonstrated a commitment to overcoming local barriers, primarily by having enacted improved laws and regulations.” The deadline for applications for round two of the competition is October 15, 2024. Learn more information about the PRO Housing program. HUD Launches Legacy Challenge Today, HUD is also launching a $250 million “Legacy Challenge” for transformative housing investments. Communities that receive direct annual awards through the Community Development Block Grant program to leverage low-cost, low interest loans for transformative housing investments. This program is a key lever that enables communities to take on legacy projects that will transform and revitalize neighborhoods. Up to $250 million in funding will be made available through the Section 108 Loan Guarantee to make transformative housing-forward changes in local communities across America. HUD Acting Secretary Todman stated that “I’m challenging our nation’s mayors and governors to use this unique funding mechanism to build new housing.” This funding can be used to make transformative changes in local communities through: Adaptive reuse, including commercial-to-residential conversion Preservation and rehabilitation of existing units Infrastructure to support housing production such as utility installation or upgrades Manufactured housing, including facilities to build new homes Eligible housing uses within mixed-use or transient oriented development projects Revolving loan pools to support local housing development For communities that express interest by November 1, 2024, HUD will offer additional repayment flexibilities and waivers to streamline program requirements. HUD will invite applicants to participate in a technical assistance cohort and provide tools to support application development. On August 29, 2024, HUD will host a kickoff webinar to share more about the Legacy Challenge.

"Tuesday, August 13, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_204,Biden-Harris Administration Enhances Program to Build More Affordable Homes,"New update to HUD financing program for state and local housing finance agencies will support the construction of new, affordable homes for American families WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and the U.S. Department of the Treasury today announced new actions to provide more interest rate certainty for state and local Housing Finance Agencies (HFAs) that use the Federal Housing Administration’s (FHA) risk sharing initiative with the Federal Financing Bank to finance new construction of affordable housing. Since Day One, the Biden-Harris Administration has been committed to using all available tools to boost the supply of affordable homes and lower housing costs for all Americans. This whole-of-government effort is outlined in today’s White House fact sheet, which highlights HUD’s latest actions to increase the construction of affordable new homes. HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman will underscore these new announcements and the Biden-Harris Administration’s continued efforts during a press conference today in Milwaukee, WI. “Let’s face it – we don’t have enough affordable homes. Here at HUD, we are making changes to build new, quality, affordable homes like never before,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “Today, alongside our colleagues at the Department of the Treasury, we are announcing a crucial move that will enable our partners to use our financing to build tens of thousands more rental homes for the families we serve.” FHA and the Federal Financing Bank will implement a floor and a cap, called an interest rate “collar,” on the benchmark Treasury rate used to calculate the all-in rate provided to Housing Finance Agencies. This update to the Section 542(c) Housing Finance Agency Risk-Sharing Initiative will make it easier to use the program, thereby increasing the number of new, affordable multifamily properties that can be developed using risk-sharing program financing. “The Biden-Harris Administration knows the key to reversing the affordable housing crunch is to take actions that increase housing supply. The Treasury-HUD rate collar initiative will help reduce the cost to construct more affordable housing that is so urgently needed in neighborhoods across the country,” said U.S. Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo. “Treasury will continue to do everything in our power to make housing more affordable for Americans and unlock greater economic prosperity.” The interest rate collar will be available for Housing Finance Agency-originated mortgages used to finance new construction or substantial rehabilitation of multifamily affordable housing for low-income individuals and families. It will be provided when an application for FHA-insured mortgage financing is conditionally endorsed by FHA. The final pass-through interest rate for the transaction upon completion of construction will be calculated using the floor and cap benchmark Treasury rates referenced above and programmatic spreads determined by the Federal Financing Bank. “This innovative solution to rate uncertainty will increase the usefulness and reach of a program that has already developed thousands of new rental homes through collaboration among federal, state, and local housing resources,” said Assistant Secretary for Housing and Federal Housing Commissioner Julia Gordon. “It is one of many levers we’re turning to increase production of affordable rental housing for low-income individuals and families.” “We believe this important update to the risk-sharing initiative will not only increase the creation of new, deeply affordable housing for the nation’s low-income families, it will also provide additional flexibility that will make the program usable by more state and local Housing Finance Agencies and their borrowers,” said Deputy Assistant Secretary for Multifamily Housing Programs Ethan Handelman. “This change has long been sought by Housing Finance Agencies, and we’re pleased to add it to the program enhancements we’ve implemented under the Biden-Harris Administration.” Since the Biden-Harris Administration re-started the Risk Sharing Initiative in 2021, the program has already enabled access to more than $2.7 billion in financing for the development or substantial rehabilitation of more than 16,200 affordable rental homes for low-income families, seniors, and persons with disabilities. In February 2024, FHA and the Federal Financing Bank announced they were indefinitely extending the program’s availability. FHA anticipates that approximately 38,000 additional affordable rental homes will be created or preserved through the initiative over the next ten years alone. About the Section 542(c) Housing Finance Agency Risk-Sharing Initiative with the Federal Financing Bank The Section 542(c) Housing Finance Agency Risk-Sharing Initiative allows eligible Housing Finance Agencies (HFAs) to enter into contracts with HUD through which FHA insures multifamily mortgages originated by an HFA that are used to finance construction or rehabilitation of properties with affordable housing units. Under these contracts, HUD and the HFA share the risk of any potential loss resulting from a default of the insured mortgage. With the FHA insurance credit enhancement in place, the Federal Financing Bank will purchase the mortgage, enabling the HFA to recoup their capital and make other investments in their communities. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Thursday, August 8, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_203,Biden-Harris Administration Announces New Actions Supporting Hawai’i Homeowners Seeking to Rebuild After Wildfires,"Extended flexibility for borrowers through the Federal Housing Administration now allows more time to finance single family home reconstruction in Maui County, HI. WASHINGTON - Today, on the one-year anniversary of the tragic Maui wildfires, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), through its Federal Housing Administration (FHA), announced new actions to support borrowers in Maui County, HI, whose homes were destroyed during the August 2023 wildfires. Effective immediately, eligible borrowers and renters in Maui County who lost their homes, and are in the process of rebuilding or buying another home, can continue to use FHA’s 203(h) Mortgage Insurance for Disaster Victims program to receive up to 100 percent financing. This latest action underscores the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to rebuilding Maui communities and helping families recover from disaster. Today’s announcements are part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s ongoing coordinated and comprehensive Federal response to ensure the long-term recovery of survivors and impacted communities. The White House outlined today the Administration’s priorities for ongoing and long-term recovery efforts, including moving residents from temporary shelters into longer term housing solutions, supporting home rebuilding efforts, and ensuring that new homes are climate resilient, so families can stay safe as climate-fueled extreme weather events become more frequent due to climate change. “After wildfires hit Maui last year, people’s homes were destroyed, and people’s lives were disrupted. Immediately after, HUD got to work to help people recover,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “This included providing support for people who live in HUD subsidized homes, and providing support for people who were homeless. With this action, today we are continuing our support for homeowners to ensure that they can rebuild and stay on Maui.” A waiver issued today lifts the requirement that borrowers apply for 203(h) financing by the one-year anniversary of the Presidentially Declared Major Disaster. Today’s change allows lenders to offer 203(h) financing to Maui borrowers through August 10, 2025. This new flexibility follows FHA’s third extension of its foreclosure moratorium for borrowers with FHA-insured single family mortgages in Maui County, HI, which now runs through January 1, 2025. FHA is continuing this relief due to the extent of the devastation from the wildfires, the reduced capacity for borrowers to access needed construction supplies and resources, the number of jobs that have not yet returned, and other unique challenges associated with the geographic location of Maui. The extension will provide affected borrowers in Maui County more time to obtain federal, state, and local assistance, to work with a HUD-certified housing counselor, and/or to rebuild without the added burden of dealing with foreclosure actions. “We remain committed to doing all that we can to help residents of Maui County recover from the 2023 wildfires,” said Federal Housing Commissioner Julia Gordon. “Extending the time to use FHA financing for rebuilding, in addition to extending our foreclosure moratorium, reflects our strong desire to continue helping families trying to rebuild their lives after this uniquely catastrophic event.” Immediately after wildfires hit the community, HUD issued new flexibilities, provided new resources, and ensured that HUD partners on the ground were ready to assist those affected. HUD then awarded more than $8 million in Rapid Unsheltered Survivor Housing (RUSH) – $6.9 million in February 2024 and $1.3 million in August 2023 – to address the needs of individuals and families who are homeless or at risk of homelessness and have needs not otherwise served or fully met by existing Federal disaster relief programs. For Borrowers and Renters in Maui County For those with a home with a mortgage insured by FHA in the Maui County disaster area and who are unable to make their mortgage payments, immediate relief is available. Homeowners are likely to have a range of options that can help them avoid the need to default on their mortgage or to sell their home or land. Borrowers should contact their mortgage servicer for assistance as soon as practical. Borrowers may also contact the FHA Resource Center at (800) CALL-FHA (1-800-877-8339; or for TTY 1-800-877-8339), or by email at answers@hud.gov, for assistance. For borrowers and renters who need immediate housing and disaster recovery assistance, HUD-certified housing counselors are prepared and well-trained to provide guidance on the options that are available. To find a HUD-approved housing counseling agency, borrowers can use HUD’s online search tool at hud.gov/findacounselor or use our phone search by calling (800) 569-4287 or (202) 708-1455 (TTY). ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Thursday, August 8, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_202,Biden-Harris Administration Expands Access to Housing for Veterans,"WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced a new set of policy changes that will help more veterans receive assistance under the HUD-Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) program, and improve their access to supportive housing developments. Veterans experiencing homelessness often receive VA benefits as a result of an injury or illness that was acquired or worsened during military service. Before this change, these benefits were considered income when determining eligibility for certain supportive housing developments—causing some veterans to exceed the income threshold for these programs. HUD’s policy changes will help more homeless veterans with service-connected disability benefits gain access to these housing developments. Additionally, HUD today awarded $20 million to public housing agencies to continue to improve the HUD-VASH program. “No veteran should ever have to experience homelessness, but when they do, they should not face barriers to getting help they deserve,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “This policy change will ensure that veterans who are receiving the disability benefits they earned through service and sacrifice can access the housing assistance and supportive services they need to resolve their homelessness.” The HUD-VASH Program is a vital resource to house veterans experiencing homelessness. HUD-VASH pairs rental assistance through housing vouchers targeted to veterans experiencing homelessness from HUD with case management and other supportive services provided by VA. VA homeless program staff at local VA medical centers identify veterans experiencing homelessness and refer them to public housing agencies who issue vouchers to eligible veteran and their families. VA staff provide case management and other “wrap-around” supportive services to assist the veteran household to find and enter rental housing, retain housing, and connect to health care, employment, and other supports. “The days of a Veteran having to choose between getting the VA benefits they deserve and the housing support they need are finally over,” said VA Secretary Denis McDonough. “This is a critical step forward that will help Veterans nationwide – and bring us one step closer to our ultimate goal of putting an end to Veteran homelessness for good.” HUD is expanding access to HUD-VASH for veterans by: Requiring public housing agencies (PHAs) that administer HUD-VASH to set the initial income eligibility for veterans at 80% of Area Median Income, rather than 50% of Area Median Income. The use of this higher initial income eligibility threshold is currently optional and many housing agencies have already adopted the higher threshold, but HUD is now making this increase mandatory. Adopting an alternative definition of annual income for applicants and participants of the HUD-VASH program that excludes veterans’ service-connected disability benefits when determining eligibility. This alternative annual income definition could be adopted by other housing subsidy programs to determine income eligibility. HUD has been working with the U.S. Department of the Treasury to determine the effect of the alternative income definition for HUD-VASH participants seeking housing subsidized by Low Income Housing Credits. Treasury expects to issue guidance on this issue in the near term. HUD will also encourage state and local governments to make corresponding changes in their subsidy programs to ensure that all veterans experiencing homelessness have access to supportive housing. “Every veteran deserves a roof over their head, and the Biden-Harris Administration is doing everything we possibly can to end veteran homelessness,” said White House Domestic Policy Advisor Neera Tanden. “Today’s actions reflect President Biden and Vice President Harris’s commitment to breaking down barriers to housing so that every veteran gets the benefits they have earned.” The revised HUD-VASH operating requirements also include additional policy changes that will improve the administration of the HUD-VASH program. This will allow PHAs the authority to: Make non-competitive awards of project-based HUD-VASH contracts to housing projects or units on VA facilities that serve HUD-VASH families; Approve Exception Payment Standards as a Reasonable Accommodations up to 140% of the Fair Market Rent; Set a separate minimum rent policy (including a zero minimum rent) for HUD-VASH participants. In addition to these policy changes, HUD awarded $20 million available for additional administrative fee funding to 245 public housing agencies in 43 states currently administering HUD-VASH. With this funding, PHAs are encouraged to expand their housing search assistance to support veterans, expand landlord recruitment for the program, offer incentives and retention payments, help veterans with security deposits, and provide landlord-tenant mediation activities. Since the program’s inception, HUD-VASH has assisted more than 200,000 veterans to exit homelessness and obtain permanent affordable housing. The HUD-VASH program has been the cornerstone of our nation’s success in reducing the number of veterans experiencing homelessness by more than 50% since 2010. The revised HUD-VASH operating requirements can be found here. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

This funding was originally listed in the grant announcements made on April 9, 2024. This funding will help transform communities by fixing older housing, preserving affordable housing, and improving the health of children and families in these communities. “Today, we are renewing our commitment to improving the lives of children, seniors and persons with disabilities by eliminating hazards where they live,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “These grants provide a critical resource to make homes safer.” HUD is providing these grants through its Healthy Homes Production Grant Program, which takes a comprehensive approach to addressing multiple childhood diseases and injuries in the home by focusing on housing-related hazards in a coordinated fashion, rather than addressing a single hazard at a time. These investments will identify and remediate housing-related health and safety hazards in privately owned, low-income rental and/or owner-occupied housing, especially in units and/or buildings where families with children, older adults 62 years and older, or families with persons with disabilities reside. “Housing is as essential as health care, and these grants expand HUD’s commitment to providing safe and healthy homes for all,” said Matthew Ammon, Director of HUD’s Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes. “This investment will enable us to improve living conditions, enhance health outcomes and ensure safety of families in need.” The following is a breakdown of the second round of funding being reaffirmed today: Awardee State Units Proposed Award Community Action Council of Howard County MD 200 $2,000,000 City of Lancaster PA 145 $2,000,000 Adult and Youth United Development Association, Inc.

WAUKEGAN - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced the completion of a nearly $28 million Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) transaction with the Waukegan Housing Authority (WHA), to expand affordable housing options for low-income seniors in Waukegan, Illinois. “The Biden-Harris Administration and HUD are committed to ensuring our country’s seniors can afford their homes and age with dignity – that means both building and preserving affordable homes in their communities,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “Today, we continue to deliver on this commitment, building and repairing nearly 100 homes for seniors in Waukegan, Illinois.” Constructed in 1964, Ravine Terrace is a 98-unit, eight-story building that is in extensive need of repair and improvements due to its advanced age. The transaction funds the rehabilitation and reconfiguration of 56 studio apartments into 28 larger, one-bedroom homes; and the renovation of 42 one-bedroom homes. Additionally, 28 new homes will be constructed on a parcel of land near the existing property. Once completed, 98 homes will be available for seniors, in addition to new amenities and services, including a community room and an on-site leasing office allowing them to access support within reach. “We are proud to announce our commitment to providing safe and affordable homes for seniors that are one of the most vulnerable populations facing housing insecurity today,” said Deputy Assistant Secretary for Multifamily Housing Programs Ethan Handelman. The total construction cost for the project is $27.8 million, which represents approximately $284,000 per home. The project is financed through an FHA-insured mortgage, funds from the HOME Investment Partnerships Program and Illinois Housing Development Authority, and a four percent Low-Income Housing Tax Credits. About RAD RAD was designed to help address the multi-billion-dollar nationwide backlog of deferred maintenance in the public housing portfolio and to stem the loss of affordable housing that could no longer be kept to decent standards. From the program’s inception through July 1, 2024, the Rental Assistance Demonstration has facilitated more than $19.7 billion in capital investment to improve or replace over 220,000 deeply rent-assisted homes, most of which house extremely low-income families, seniors, and persons with disabilities. Under RAD, projects funded under the public housing program convert their public housing assistance to project-based Section 8 rental assistance. Under Section 8, residents continue to pay 30% of their income towards rent and the housing must continue to serve those with very low and extremely low incomes, as was the case when the property was assisted through the public housing program. Residents must be notified and consulted prior to conversion, are given a right to return to assisted housing post-construction so that the same tenants can enjoy these newly preserved and improved apartments and maintain the same fundamental rights they had as public housing residents.

"Wednesday, July 31, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_199,HUD Invests $1.5 Million to Modernize Homes for Illinois Families,"WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced the recent completion of two transactions totaling $1.5 million to finance energy efficient and climate resilient improvements for affordable homes in Illinois under the Green and Resilient Retrofit Program (GRRP). The rehabilitations will update existing common spaces, including replacing roofing, windows, doors, and lighting for very low-income seniors. Renovations will also include upgrades to mechanical, plumbing, and electrical systems, electrification, insulation, renewable energy integration, and stormwater management. “I’m proud to serve in an Administration that’s investing in an energy-efficient, climate resilient future for all communities,” said HUD Assistant Secretary for Housing and Federal Housing Commissioner Julia Gordon. “Today, we are delivering $1.5 million from President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act to install high-efficiency windows, support full electrification, and boost solar energy for Illinois families.” The first project is a $750,000 loan to Brainerd Senior Center, a 60-unit, six-story building in Chicago, Illinois. The second is a $750,000 grant to Round Barn Manor, a 156-unit, two-story building in Champaign, Illinois. These transactions are the first to use GRRP funds for construction projects in Illinois. “We are pleased to provide Green and Resilient Retrofit Program funding to Brainerd Senior Center and Round Barn Manor to help upgrade their properties, reduce carbon emissions, and make seniors’ homes safer and more energy efficient,” said Ethan Handelman, HUD’s Deputy Assistant Secretary for Multifamily Housing Programs. “Funding this work in Illinois and throughout the country to improve the lives of residents is exactly what this Administration intended by allocating $1 billion in funding for the program through the President’s Inflation Reduction Act.” Constructed in 2000, Brainerd Senior Center will update all 60 units as well as existing common spaces, which includes replacing roofing, windows, insulation, doors, lighting, electrification improvements, and more. HUD provides rental assistance under the Section 811 Project Rental Assistance program to 12 of the households at the property. The project is also participating in the City of Chicago Decarbonization program, which enables HVAC system updates and the replacement of appliances with electric and energy-efficient alternatives. Built in 1978, Round Barn Manor will see improvements to vital systems such as mechanical, plumbing, and electrical and the functions of the community spaces. Round Barn Manor will also use Federal Solar Investment Tax Credits (ITC) to implement a major system improvement by installing a ground-mounted solar system adjacent to the site. HUD provides rental assistance under its Section 8 project-based rental assistance program to all of the households at the property. About GRRP Funded under the Inflation Reduction Act, GRRP provides funding for direct loans and grants to make improvements to HUD-subsidized properties serving very low-income families, seniors, and persons with disabilities. Properties were selected through three distinct funding opportunities designed to meet the diverse needs of properties across the country. Funding can be used to improve energy or water efficiency, enhance indoor air quality, install zero-emission electricity generation and energy storage equipment, acquire low-emission building materials, implement building electrification strategies, or address and improve climate resilience. The program seeks to amplify recent technological advancements in energy and water efficiency and to bring a new focus on preparing for climate hazards by reducing residents’ and properties’ exposure to hazards and by protecting life, livability, and property when disaster strikes. HUD has offered funding through three GRRP award types targeting HUD-subsidized affordable housing: Elements awards provide modest funding for property owners to incorporate proven and impactful climate resilience and carbon reduction measures to the construction scopes of an in-progress recapitalization transactions. Property owners use the funds to add green or resilient elements to existing scopes of property rehabilitation. Leading Edge awards provide funding for property owners to meet ambitious carbon reduction, renewable energy generation, and resilience goals without requiring extensive technical assistance from HUD.\ Comprehensive awards provide funding for properties with the highest need for climate resilience and energy efficiency upgrades to undertake a deep retrofit, focused on innovative energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions reductions, green and healthy housing measures, renewable energy generation, and climate resilience investments. Comprehensive Awards are designed for the widest range of properties and are accompanied by direct support from HUD to achieve the retrofit. FACT SHEET: Green and Resilient Retrofit Program Progress to Date GRRP is the first HUD program to simultaneously invest in energy efficiency, renewable energy generation, climate resilience, and low-embodied-carbon materials in HUD-assisted multifamily housing. As of July 23, 2024, GRRP funding has been awarded to 171 properties and more than 20,700 rental homes, to make them greener, healthier, and safer for low-income households, seniors, and persons with disabilities. The projects span the range from targeted upgrades to major net-zero renovation for properties in 38 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. As of July 23, 2024, HUD has awarded more than $773.4 million in grants and surplus cash loans under the GRRP; $393.6 million in grants and $379.7 million in surplus cash loans. GRRP projects range from targeted upgrades supplementing in-progress recapitalization efforts to major net-zero renovations. Approximately 900 properties have also signed up for HUD’s free energy and water consumption benchmarking service, also funded through the Inflation Reduction Act. With benchmarking, HUD-assisted housing property owners can better understand the energy and water consumption at their properties to assess potential upgrades. In addition to ensuring that participating properties undergo deep retrofit work to increase their efficiency, make them greener and more resilient to climate hazards, it will also serve to preserve these units as affordable housing long-term.

"Wednesday, July 31, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_198,HUD Announces Over $3.5 Billion to Help People Experiencing Homelessness,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced that it will provide more than $3.5 billion in competitive funding to homeless services organizations across the country for supportive services and housing programs for people experiencing homelessness. “This year’s funding opportunity makes available the largest amount of funding in history under the Continuum of Care program and reflects the Biden-Harris Administration’s continued commitment to tackle the nation’s homelessness crisis with the urgency it requires,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “Nobody should have to live in their car or on the streets. These funds will provide shelter to Americans when they need our help the most.” The competitive funding will be awarded through HUD’s Continuum of Care Program, the largest source of federal grant funding for homeless services and housing programs serving people experiencing homelessness. Nearly 400 Continuum of Care communities apply, and HUD funds approximately 7,000 homeless services projects annually through the Continuum of Care Program. Projects are operated by nonprofit providers, States, Indian Tribes, or Tribally Designated Housing Entities, and local governments. For the first time, HUD is issuing a two-year Continuum of Care (CoC) Program Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) as authorized by the consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024. Communities are only required to submit one CoC application that will be applicable for FY 2024 and FY 2025 funds. This change will streamline the application process and significantly reduce the administrative burden on applicants. Read HUD’s Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) here. HUD is also applying a first-of-its-kind cost of living adjustment to allow CoC budgets to better keep up with rising costs. This will provide additional pay and support for homeless assistance providers and improve overall service delivery for people experiencing homelessness. “We don’t talk enough about the thousands of providers who work every day to end homelessness.” said Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary Marion McFadden for Community Planning and Development. “Our approach this year incorporates the feedback we received from providers to increase support for staff and reduce administrative burden by moving to a two-year application cycle so that staff can focus less time on paperwork needed to submit federal grant applications and more time on their core duties helping people experiencing homelessness.” As with prior NOFOs, Continuums of Care will have the opportunity to renew existing projects, apply for new projects, and reallocate resources from lower performing projects to better serve people experiencing homelessness. The NOFO contains explicit funding for (1) survivors of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking; (2) youth; and (3) people experiencing the unique challenges of homelessness in rural areas. The NOFO will provide at least $52 million for new rapid re-housing, supportive services, and other activities critical to assist survivors of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking. Approximately $188 million is available for the competitive and non-competitive renewal and replacement of expiring Youth Homelessness Demonstration Program (YHDP) grants. Today’s announcement complements funding that HUD recently made available for permanent supportive housing under the new CoCBuilds competition and recent efforts to improve the way CoCs address the needs of youth and young adults through the Youth Homelessness System Improvement Grants, and the FY 2023 Youth Homelessness Demonstration Program. Since Day One, the Biden-Harris Administration has been tackling the nation’s homelessness crisis with the urgency it requires, prioritizing new resources and programs to help communities quickly reconnect people experiencing homelessness to housing. HUD remains committed to ending homelessness for all persons, placing emphasis on racial equity and anti-discrimination policies for LGTBQ+ individuals, engaging persons with lived experiences of homelessness in decision-making, and increasing the supply of affordable housing. The deadline to submit Continuum of Care Consolidated applications and project applications is 8:00 PM EDT on October 30, 2024. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

FAIRBANKS, AK - Today, senior leaders from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) joined the University of Alaska Fairbanks to demonstrate and highlight one of the innovative ways HUD is working to boost the supply of affordable homes: 3-D printing. “We need to think bigger, bolder, and more creatively than ever if we want to build the affordable homes of the future,” said Solomon Greene, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research. “Here at HUD, we are using innovative solutions to build the housing our growing nation needs. This 3-D printer is an exciting representation of this new frontier, and we cannot wait to see it at work.” At today’s event, Solomon Greene, HUD’s Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research, Richard Monocchio, HUD’s Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, and Northwest Regional Administrator Andrew Lofton joined Pat Pitney, the President of the University of Alaska Fairbanks, to showcase this new potential solution to building affordable homes. “This partnership is instrumental towards our work to invest in new, innovative technologies to address Alaska’s housing challenges,” said University of Alaska President Pat Pitney. “I’m grateful to HUD and our private and academic partners for making this happen, and we’re excited to see what this printer will do for our community.” “This is a momentous day, not only for us at HUD or for our partners, but for the future of affordable housing construction in extreme climates in places like Alaska,” said HUD Northwest Regional Administrator Andrew Lofton. “Today, we showcased the latest example of how technological innovation, when paired with local knowledge and strong community partnerships, can help us build the quality, affordable, and resilient homes our country needs.” HUD presented a Research Partnership grant of $600,000 to the City of Nome, Alaska, in May 2023, helping to support this crucial work. The project team, including partners Xtreme Habitats Institute (XHI) and Penn State University, will conduct the design, engineering, materials research, development, planning, and analysis required to 3-D print high-quality, affordable, energy-efficient, and sustainable housing for communities in sub-arctic regions of Alaska. In Fairbanks, students and researchers at the University of Alaska will continue to refine, test, and design protocols for the mobile printer that will move to Nome. In Nome, the team will use the mobile 3-D printer designed and built for the environment to construct and evaluate a prototype home. One of the key goals of this construction project is to use sustainable local resources for the construction material. Outside of HUD and the City of Nome, other key partners on this project include the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation, the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, the Cold Climate Housing Research Center, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, XHab 3D, Inc., and Fairbanks Materials, Inc. In April, HUD launched the “Road to Innovation” tour, led by the Office of Policy Development & Research (PD&R), where HUD leaders traveled across the country to uplift examples of investment in innovative construction techniques boosting affordable housing supply. Fairbanks is the 7th stop of the ongoing tour, following trips to Detroit, Minneapolis, Seattle, Portland, New York City, and Jersey City during the spring. Under the Biden Harris Administration, HUD has not only invested in innovation to boost the supply of homes, but also partnered with entrepreneurs and innovators in the private sector and updated HUD rules to help unleash and scale housing innovation. At HUD’s 2024 Innovative Housing Showcase, the Department welcomed thousands of visitors to the National Mall to view incredible exhibitors, showcasing their own models of innovative housing from their communities. At the Showcase, Acting Secretary Todman launched a new program to invest in manufactured home communities – a key affordable option for many families. In July 2022, HUD initiated the largest set of proposed changes to the HUD Code in over two decades, proposing to allow materials that facilitate modern design approaches and improve quality, allow certain ridge roof designs, add provisions for multifamily manufactured homes of up to three units, update requirements for open floor plans, add accessibility improvements, and more.

Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary Richard Monocchio made the announcement today in Anchorage, Alaska, where he presented $6 million to the Cook Inlet Housing Authority to build 51 new housing units to increase the number of homes available to low-income Alaskan Native families. “The Biden-Harris Administration is proud to work alongside our Tribal partners to help them meet the housing needs that exist in Indian Country,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “These funds will help build and repair homes desperately needed right now.” The Indian Housing Block Grant (IHBG) Competitive funds play a crucial role in bolstering vibrant American Indian and Alaska Native communities. These funds are designated for various purposes, such as new construction, rehabilitation, and infrastructure to support affordable housing within Indian reservations and similar areas. The IHBG Competitive program holds particular significance for Tribal communities as it injects essential financial resources for the construction of new affordable housing for disadvantaged Tribal families. “I am pleased to be here in Anchorage to make this announcement where Tribes, who often face unique obstacles when it comes to constructing new affordable housing, are able to use the Indian Housing Block Grant Competitive awards to better serve Native families,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary Richard Monocchio. “This Administration will continue to prioritize Nation-to-Nation relations and funding for Native American housing. As I’ve seen through my visits with Tribes across the nation, investing in Indian Country is highly impactful.” This funding serves as a valuable addition to the yearly IHBG formula funding, which often falls short in covering the expenses of constructing new homes and is typically allocated for the operation and upkeep of current housing. HUD looks forward to seeing these projects become a reality.

This is 0.6 percent (±14.6 percent)* below the revised May rate of 621,000 and is 7.4 percent (±15.2 percent)* below the June 2023 estimate of 666,000. Sales Price The median sales price of new houses sold in June 2024 was $417,300. The average sales price was $487,200. For Sale Inventory and Months’ Supply The seasonally-adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of June was 476,000. This represents a supply of 9.3 months at the current sales rate. The July report is scheduled for release on August 23, 2024. View the full schedule in the Economic Briefing Room. The full text and tables for this release can be found at www.census.gov/construction/nrs/. EXPLANATORY NOTES These statistics are estimated from sample surveys. They are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated average relative standard errors of the preliminary data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as “2.5 percent (±3.2%) above” appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90-percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. Changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show irregular movement. It takes 3 months to establish a trend for new houses sold. Preliminary new home sales figures are subject to revision due to the survey methodology and definitions used. The survey is primarily based on a sample of houses selected from building permits. Since a “sale” is defined as a deposit taken or sales agreement signed, this can occur prior to a permit being issued. An estimate of these prior sales is included in the sales figure. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimate of total sales is revised about 3.2 percent. Changes in sales price data reflect changes in the distribution of houses by region, size, etc., as well as changes in the prices of houses with identical characteristics. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found on the Census Bureau website. The Census Bureau has reviewed SOC monthly and quarterly tables to ensure appropriate access, use, and disclosure avoidance protection of the confidential source data (Disclosure Review Board (DRB) approval number: CBDRBFY23-0307).

"Tuesday, July 23, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_190,Biden-Harris Administration Announces $19 Million in New Housing Investments,"As part of President Biden’s Investing in America Agenda, HUD announces new awards for climate resilience and energy efficiency renovations. WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced $19 million in new grant and loan awards to 32 properties under its Green and Resilient Retrofit Program (GRRP). These grants and loans will support significant energy efficiency and climate resilience renovations in more than 4,260 homes occupied by low-income individuals, families, and seniors. Today’s awards bring the total funding awarded under this program to more than $773 million, serving 20,752 homes. HUD’s Deputy Assistant Secretary for Multifamily Housing Programs Ethan Handelman announced this new funding today at a press conference at Plymouth Square Village in Detroit, Michigan, which will receive a $750,000 loan to make crucial climate resilience and energy efficiency enhancements. “The Biden-Harris Administration is ensuring that our country’s housing stock is not only affordable, but also resilient and energy-efficient,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “Today, we are awarding crucial funds to renovate thousands of homes, making enhancements such as improved indoor air quality and integrating renewable energy sources. These changes are not trivial – they will reduce costs and increase the quality of life of the people we house.” This round of funding includes awards for properties in 18 states, including the first award in Vermont. The funding announced today will increase energy and water efficiency, reduce climate pollution, generate renewable energy and reduce emissions, promote the use of low embodied carbon materials, and improve the quality of life for residents by making their homes more resilient to climate risks and by improving indoor air quality. “These awards once again demonstrate the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to affordable housing preservation and climate resilience,” said Assistant Secretary for Housing Julia Gordon. “We’re investing funds that will improve the homes and lives of thousands of lower income individuals and families and make a real difference in areas where investment has lagged for far too long.” All of the investments announced today will advance environmental justice in line with President Biden’s Justice40 Initiative, which sets a goal that 40 percent of the overall benefits of certain federal investments flow to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized by underinvestment and overburdened by pollution. Retrofitting these homes will reduce their emissions, make them more resilient to extreme weather events, cut energy costs, and advance the President’s housing and clean energy agenda, ensuring affordable housing stays affordable for residents and building owners across the nation. President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act—the largest climate investment in history—established the GRRP in 2022 to fund energy efficiency, electrification, clean energy, and climate resiliency improvements for HUD’s assisted rental portfolio. The grants and loans announced today are the third set of awards made under the GRRP’s Elements category, which provides funding to properties for proven and meaningful climate resilience and utility efficiency measures in projects that are already in the process of being recapitalized. Of the 32 properties receiving Elements awards today, 29 are properties that participate in the HUD Section 8 project-based rental assistance program for low-income individuals and families and three properties participate in HUD’s Section 202 project-based rental assistance program for low-income seniors. Six properties have more than 200 units, 22 properties have between 51-200 units, and four properties have 50 or fewer units. FACT SHEET: Green and Resilient Retrofit Program Progress to Date GRRP is the first HUD program to simultaneously invest in energy efficiency, renewable energy generation, climate resilience, and low-embodied-carbon materials in HUD-assisted multifamily housing. All of the investments under the GRRP will be made in affordable housing communities serving low-income families, directly benefiting HUD-assisted housing, in alignment with the Justice40 Initiative. As of July 23, 2024, GRRP funding has been awarded to 171 properties and more than 20,700 rental homes, to make them greener, healthier, and safer for low-income households, seniors, and persons with disabilities.

"Monday, July 22, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_189,In Case You Missed It: Acting Secretary Todman Discusses Critical Agency Investments and Homeownership at UnidosUS Conference,"WASHINGTON – Last week, HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman gave remarks and participated in a fireside chat to discuss the critical investments made in housing from the Biden-Harris administration and the importance of addressing homeownership in the Latino community. Since the beginning, the Biden-Harris Administration has tackled this nation’s housing crisis head-on. By expanding housing supply and creating affordable housing options, we can ensure that more families, especially those in the Latino community, have an opportunity to achieve the dream of homeownership, which is a cornerstone of financial stability and generational wealth. Just in the past couple years, we have helped over half a million Latino families buy and refinance their home. Since 2021, HUD supported nearly 3 million first time homebuyers. Of those first-time homebuyers, the percentage of FHA mortgages insuring Latino borrowers doubled the rate of the market average. Our country is committed to implementing policies that support these goals, recognizing that a diverse and inclusive housing market benefits everyone. HUD Assistant Secretary for Administration Elizabeth de León Bhargava and Ginnie Mae Acting President Sam Valverde, who is the first Latino leader of this key institution, also attended the UnidosUS Conference, meeting with stakeholders from across the country to discuss innovative ways to address affordable housing. Bhargava highlighted how the Biden-Harris Administration provided $85 million in funding for communities to identify and remove barriers to affordable housing production and preservation, and lower housing costs. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Monday, July 22, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_188,HUD Offers Housing Counselor Certification Exam in Additional Languages,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today the availability of a newly updated certification exam for housing counselors. In addition to content updates, the exam and associated training materials are now available in Spanish, Traditional Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese. The announcement was made last week by Deputy Assistant Secretary for the Office of Housing Counseling David Berenbaum at the UNIDOS US Annual Conference Latino Homeownership Meeting in Las Vegas, NV. “Throughout our programs, we continue to work to remove barriers to purchasing or renting a home. We want the HUD certification process to support housing counselors who can capably assist a diverse range of client populations and languages,” said Assistant Secretary for Housing Julia Gordon. All counselors must pass the HUD certification exam, which ensures that consumers receive accurate, relevant, and quality housing counseling services. Updates to the exam include new questions that incorporate counseling scenarios that are relevant to current client needs, refreshed training and practice exam questions, and a newly updated Housing Counseling Certification Exam website where counselors can find both the certification exam and HUD’s Home Equity Conversion Mortgage counselor exam. HUD-certified housing counselors provide a range of services, including financial and homebuyer education, foreclosure and eviction prevention counseling, disaster relief and recovery counseling, and more. There are over 4,300 HUD-certified housing counselors and more than 1,480 HUD-approved housing counseling agencies currently serving more than one million clients each year. “With our updated exam and new availability in multiple languages, we are continuing to ensure that the vital role of HUD-certified housing counselors is relevant and accessible to all,” said Deputy Assistant Secretary David Berenbaum. “Including in-language resources for counselors who work with clients whose preferred language is not English enables culturally sensitive and linguistically appropriate counseling.” To find a HUD-approved housing counseling agency, visit our online search tool at hud.gov/findacounselor, or call our toll-free line at 800-569-4287 (202-708-1455 TTY). ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Monday, July 22, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_187,HUD Launches New $175 Million Opportunity to Build Housing,"Funding will build new homes for people experiencing homelessness. WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) made $175 million available through first-of-its-kind funding for new construction, acquisition, or rehabilitation of permanent supportive housing. Through one-time awards under the Continuum of Care (CoC) program, the CoCBuilds Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) will enable communities to develop new units of rental housing with supportive services for people experiencing homelessness. This NOFO ensures that funding will benefit communities of varying demographics and population sizes by setting aside $65 million for CoCs that are located in states with populations of fewer than 2.5 million people. Applications are due November 21, 2024. “Simply put, we need to build more housing and we need to repair the housing we have,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “This new funding is a focused investment in housing for people experiencing homelessness, particularly given the increased number of Americans sleeping on our streets.” Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH) is non time-limited rental housing in which supportive services are available to assist individuals with a disability who are experiencing homelessness - and to assist families where at least one household member has a disability and is experiencing homelessness - to live independently. PSH addresses both the immediate need for housing and the underlying factors contributing to homelessness, leading to better outcomes for individuals and communities alike. “When we have a safe, stable place to call home, we’re able to focus on our health, our families, and our communities. For our neighbors experiencing homelessness, especially those living with disabilities, this funding will provide access to affordable housing and lifesaving services,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development Marion McFadden. “The CoCBuilds competition further advances the Administration’s commitment to boosting housing supply and ensuring homelessness is rare, brief, and non-recurring.” Through the CoCBuilds initiative, HUD is encouraging CoCs to leverage awarded funds provided for construction, acquisition, or rehabilitation of new PSH units with other funding sources - maximizing the amount of housing available to meet the needs of individuals and families experiencing homelessness. In addition to funding the creation of new units, up to 20 percent of each award may be used for other eligible CoC Program activities associated with PSH projects including supportive services and operating costs—costs which are renewable. To support the housing needs of tribal communities, the CoCBuilds NOFO provides incentives for funding projects in partnership with Indian Tribes and Tribally Designated Housing Entities (TDHEs). Permanent supportive housing is a beneficial strategy in addressing homelessness for several reasons. Stability: It provides stable housing for individuals who may otherwise be experiencing homelessness or precariously housed, offering a foundation for stability in their lives. Support Services: It offers on-site or readily accessible, voluntary support services such as counseling, healthcare, substance abuse treatment, and job training, tailored to the individual's needs. It can reduce overall public costs by decreasing the use of emergency services, such as hospitals, shelters, and law enforcement, which are often utilized at higher rates by individuals experiencing homelessness. Improved Health Outcomes: Stable housing contributes to better physical and mental health outcomes for residents, as they have a safe and consistent environment in which to address health issues and access regular care. Community Integration: Permanent supportive housing allows individuals to become integrated into their communities, fostering a sense of belonging and social connection, which are crucial for overall well-being. Prevention of Recidivism: For individuals who have experienced incarceration or cycles of homelessness, permanent supportive housing can break these cycles by providing a stable environment and support systems to prevent relapse into previous patterns. To ensure a comprehensive approach, applicants are expected to partner with housing, health and service agencies to ensure access to supportive and public services while increasing the local affordable housing supply. The CoCBuilds initiative builds upon the Biden-Harris Administration’s historic investments in housing and homelessness. The American Rescue Plan provided over $5 Billion through the HOME-ARP program to build new rental housing, provide rental assistance, develop non-congregate shelter, and supportive services to those experiencing or at risk of homelessness. Earlier this year, HUD awarded nearly $3.16 billion in Continuum of Care funding through the annual competition for over 7,000 projects across the country. Since Day One, the Biden-Harris Administration has been tackling the nation’s homelessness crisis with the urgency it requires, prioritizing new resources and programs to help communities quickly reconnect people experiencing homelessness to housing. HUD remains committed to policy priorities of ending homelessness for all persons, placing emphasis on racial equity and anti-discrimination policies for LGTBQ+ individuals, engaging persons with lived experiences of homelessness in decision-making, and increasing the supply of affordable housing.

"Friday, July 19, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_186,HUD Charges Wisconsin Housing Provider with Discriminating Against a Tenant with Disabilities,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has charged Tammy and Ramiro Estrada, the owner of a duplex in Appleton, Wisconsin, with violating the Fair Housing Act by refusing to grant a tenant with a disability a reasonable accommodation to allow the tenant to live with her assistance animals. The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination because of disability, including the denial of reasonable accommodations. Individuals with disabilities have the right to reasonable accommodations when such accommodations are necessary to afford them equal access to their home, including the use of assistance animals. Additionally, individuals are protected from coercion, intimidation, threats, or interference when they assert their fair housing rights or file a complaint with HUD. ""The creation of artificial and unreasonable obstacles to granting a reasonable accommodation, because an assistance animal is involved, is against the law,” said Diane M. Shelley, HUD Principal Assistant Deputy Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. “HUD is committed to ensuring that individuals with a disability can access housing.” “Individuals with disabilities are entitled to the use of assistance animals as reasonable accommodations to afford them full access to their home,” said Damon Smith, HUD General Counsel. “As this Charge shows, a housing provider may not create unnecessary and artificial barriers for disabled tenants to use assistance animals to support their medical treatment.” HUD’s Charge alleges that the owners denied the tenant’s reasonable accommodation request by applying unlawful breed restrictions, fines, and fees to the request. Respondents also interfered with the Complainant’s attempt to obtain a service dog and threatened the tenants with eviction, eventually non-renewing their lease --- citing the reasonable accommodation requests in the non-renewal notice. The tenants were forced to rent more expensive housing elsewhere. A United States Administrative Law Judge will hear HUD’s Charge unless any party to the Charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds, after a hearing, that discrimination has occurred, the judge may award damages to the family for their losses because of the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief to deter further discrimination, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties to vindicate the public interest. If the federal court hears the case, the judge may also award punitive damages to the family. People who believe they are the victims of housing discrimination should contact HUD at (800) 669-9777 (voice) 800-927-9275 (TTY). Additional information is available at www.hud.gov/fairhousing.

"Thursday, July 18, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_184,HUD Convenes Summit to Address Rising Property Insurance Costs,"WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development convened a critical summit to address sharp increases in property insurance costs and lack of available coverage impacting people across the country. “It’s become abundantly clear that the rising cost of insurance is causing harm to homeowners, renters, housing providers, and entire communities,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “Today, we took a historic step to bring all of our stakeholders together in one place so we can determine solutions to protect the people we serve and preserve and create affordable housing and lower housing costs for all.” Acting Secretary Todman opened up the summit alongside Tom Perez, Senior Advisor to the President and Director of the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, before turning it over to the keynote: a fireside chat on the future of the U.S. property insurance market, moderated by The New York Times’ Emily Flitter, with major panelists including former HUD Secretary and now-President and CEO of Enterprise Community Partners Shaun Donovan, Habitat for Humanity CEO Jonathan T.M. Reckford, Arkansas Insurance Commissioner Alan McClain, and National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies President and CEO Neil Alldredge, who are on the frontlines of reckoning with rising premiums and receding coverage. Over the past several years, homeowners and housing providers have experienced significant increases in property insurance premiums and deductibles, reductions in coverage, added requirements, and withdrawals of insurance companies from certain markets. Across the Department, HUD has been reviewing its policies for opportunities to address industry challenges due to market trends while managing potential risks: HUD recently updated its multifamily insurance deductibles to address the rising costs of wind and storm coverage, reducing costs for owners while continuing to ensure that properties have adequate insurance coverage. This is a key element of HUD’s work to address insurance costs and assure that communities can recover from disaster. HUD’s new Federal Flood Risk Management Standard (FFRMS) protects communities from flood risk, heavy storms, increased frequency of severe weather events and disasters, changes in development patterns, and erosion. By implementing the FFRMS, communities can become resilient to flooding, protect lives and properties, minimize damage to households, reduce insurance costs, and safeguard federal investments – ensuring that federally funded construction projects are built to withstand current and future flood risks. HUD revised its methodology for calculating how contract rents are set in Section 8 project-based rental housing to better account for rising insurance costs among property owners in their overall operating cost. HUD clarified that Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) may submit an appeal of their Operating Fund Project Expense Level (PEL) if the PHA’s total operating costs, including the costs of insurance, have increased to a level that exceeds the PEL eligibility amount. A successful appeal would result in increased funding for the PHA. The day’s events also included other high-level speakers from across the country, who spoke on engaging panels on building resilience, protecting the future of affordable housing, and homeownership. At the conclusion of the Summit, Acting Secretary Todman and senior HUD leaders, including Federal Housing Commissioner Julia Gordon, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing Richard J. Monocchio, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development Marion McFadden, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research Solomon Greene, and Acting Ginnie Mae President Sam Valverde, all provided a response to these critical issues.

"Wednesday, July 17, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_183,HUD Proposes New Rule to Govern the Sale of FHA Mortgage Notes,"WASHINGTON – Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is proposing a new rule to govern the sale of seriously delinquent single family mortgage loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). These rules will help expand available affordable homes for families and improve stability of communities. “Every day, the Biden-Harris Administration and HUD are looking for new ways to expand the availability of affordable homes for families to purchase or rent,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “This proposed rule will help struggling homeowners, stabilize neighborhoods, and make more affordable homes available for the people we serve.” “Today’s proposal creates a permanent, standardized set of rules for note sales in the future that incorporates our learnings from previous sales that have taken place as part of the demonstration program,” said Assistant Secretary for Housing and Federal Housing Commissioner Julia Gordon. “The new rules underscore the importance of loss mitigation and promote owner occupancy and neighborhood stabilization.” Note sales of delinquent mortgages have been tested by HUD since 2002, and this proposed rule transitions the program from a demonstration to a permanent program. The proposed rule includes changes made to the demonstration program under the Biden-Harris Administration that required all note sale purchasers to adhere to mission-oriented post-sale requirements, including offering a “first-look” to owner-occupants, nonprofit organizations, and government entities when properties associated with the purchased notes are sold. The proposed rule also would enable HUD to continue prioritizing awarding these mortgage loans to nonprofit organizations and governmental entities and provides guidelines for direct sales of notes to such buyers. The program requirements included in the proposed rule are intended to ensure that the program meets its dual purpose to manage HUD’s fiduciary responsibility to the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund while encouraging mortgage loan outcomes that are consistent with its mission. Such outcomes include providing assistance to borrowers facing hardships, promoting the opportunity for new owner-occupants to buy foreclosed properties, encouraging the conversion of properties into affordable for sale and rental homes, and protecting neighborhoods against vacancy and blight. HUD is requesting public comment on its proposal, including the questions it poses to respondents, through the methods outlined in the notice by September 16, 2024. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Tuesday, July 16, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_182,Biden-Harris Administration Invests $325 Million in Housing and Community Development Improvements,"WASHINGTON - Today, President Joe Biden and HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman announced that the Biden-Harris Administration is awarding $325 million in Choice Neighborhoods Implementation Grant funding to seven communities to build more homes and revitalize neighborhoods that have been left behind. The awards will redevelop distressed housing with high-quality mixed-income options, while also providing residents with services focused on income, health, and education. Grant funds may also be used for neighborhood improvements which promote economic development and spur additional private investment. “Since the beginning of this administration, President Biden has prioritized lowering housing costs by building new homes and investing in communities,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “We are excited to announce the Choice Neighborhoods funding here in Las Vegas, which marks a transformative step towards uplifting our communities. This funding is not just an investment in buildings and infrastructure – it’s an investment in people. By enhancing housing options, this administration remains committed to building neighborhoods where everyone has the chance to thrive.” Choice Neighborhoods is HUD’s signature program and the largest place-based program in the federal government. With a comprehensive “Housing, People, and Neighborhood” approach to neighborhood investment, HUD is awarding new grants to cities in Tennessee, Texas, Alabama, Florida, Nevada, New York and New Jersey. HUD is also awarding an additional $19.5 million in funding to current grantees in Arizona, Louisiana, Maine, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, and Virginia. Choice Neighborhoods is a critical tool to preserve and expand the supply of affordable housing. The seven new Choice Neighborhoods Implementation Grantees will collectively develop over 6,500 new mixed-income units, including the one-for-one replacement of 2,677 severely distressed public housing units. The Choice Neighborhoods program has led to new businesses, parks, and grocery stores in historically disinvested neighborhoods nationwide. Resident incomes are increasing across most sites, in some cases doubling. To achieve their local goals, grantees leverage the funds they receive from HUD with other public and private resources. The seven new awardees will collectively invest more than $2.65 billion in additional resources within the Choice Neighborhood area – so that every $1 in HUD funds will generate $8.65 in additional resources. “You cannot overstate the transformative nature of Choice Neighborhoods investments in these communities. Not only are these awards made in neighborhoods in greatest need, but awardees demonstrate the vision, diligence, and capacity to leverage these funds to expand housing supply and provide vital resources to residents,” said Richard J. Monocchio, HUD’s Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing. “This Administration recognizes the importance of providing access to employment opportunities, public transportation, healthcare services, and a wide range of other amenities to people living in these communities.” To see a summary on each community’s new Implementation Grant award, click here.

"Monday, July 15, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_181,"HUD Charges Appraiser, Appraisal Management Company, and Lender with Race Discrimination","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has charged multiple entities with housing discrimination for issuing a biased appraisal and then denying a refinance loan application in Denver, Colorado. HUD’s Charge against the appraiser, Maksym Mykhailyna; appraisal company, Maverick Appraisal Group; appraisal management company, Solidifi U.S. Inc.; and lender, Rocket Mortgage, LLC, alleges that the appraiser issued a discriminatory appraisal that undervalued a Black homeowner’s property on the basis of her race. The Charge further alleges that, when the homeowner complained to Rocket Mortgage, Rocket Mortgage would only proceed with her refinance loan application based on the appraised value that she alleged was discriminatory. Read the Charge. The Fair Housing Act prohibits entities and individuals involved in real estate-related transactions, including appraisals, from discriminating in the terms and conditions of the transactions because of race. The Act also prohibits anyone from retaliating against individuals who are exercising their fair housing rights, including by reporting discrimination. “Homeownership is crucial to build both generational wealth and housing stability for Black and Brown families,” said Diane M. Shelley, HUD’s Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. “HUD will continue to vigorously enforce the Fair Housing Act against those who seek to limit the financial returns associated with homeownership because of race or any other protected characteristic.” HUD’s Charge of Discrimination alleges that Maksym Mykhailyna and his appraisal company, Maverick Appraisal Group, issued an insupportably low appraisal of a duplex owned by a Black woman in a predominantly white area of Denver. Other recent appraisals of the same property had steadily increased in value, yet this appraisal resulted in a dramatic drop, despite the Denver market experiencing substantial growth in home values at that time. To reach that low number, the appraisal was rife with inaccuracies and unsupportable methodological choices (such as relying on comparable properties in neighborhoods with greater Black populations and excluding potential comparable properties in neighborhoods with greater white populations) that not only artificially lowered the appraised value but deviated from Mr. Mykhailyna’s own methodology and findings about the relevant neighborhood in appraising similar, nearby properties with White owners. Both Solidifi and Rocket Mortgage reviewed the appraisal report but failed to correct it despite several red flags. When the homeowner complained to Rocket Mortgage, she was told she could only proceed with her loan application based on the appraisal that she alleged was discriminatory; ultimately, her application was denied. “The Fair Housing Act protects all of us from discrimination throughout the process of buying a home or securing a home loan,” said Damon Y. Smith, HUD General Counsel. “As this Charge demonstrates, HUD is committed to ensuring that no one is denied a home or a mortgage because of a discriminatory appraisal.” A United States Administrative Law Judge will hear HUD’s Charge unless any party to the Charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds, after a hearing, that discrimination has occurred, the judge may award damages to the homeowner for her losses as a result of the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief to deter further discrimination, as well as payment of attorney fees.

The funds are available for the purchase of fuel storage infrastructure benefitting the Islands, streamlining the fuel delivery process and increasing energy security and resilience on the Islands. “As a proud native of the U.S. Virgin Islands, I understand the impact of an unpredictable electric system,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “Virgin Islanders should not have to worry about losing power every day; business owners should be able to open their stores and restaurants confidently to serve customers. This funding is an investment in a better future. It is our strong expectation that local leadership will carry out their plan with the urgency and professionalism that this moment demands.” After Hurricanes Irma and Maria, the USVI received supplemental CDBG Disaster Recovery (DR) and Mitigation (MIT) funds for long-term disaster recovery as well as funds for mitigation of damages from future storms. Many of these funds are being used by the USVI to repair, upgrade, and update the electrical generation and distribution systems. This $100 million release represents just a portion of that investment. “Electrical system reliability enhances the long-term resilience and sustainability of the territory’s infrastructure,” said Marion McFadden, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development. “Maintaining the operability of hospitals, industry, commerce and peoples’ homes and businesses is the foundation of a thriving community.

These communities have been selected based on their demonstrated commitment to bridging the digital divide for HUD-assisted residents. “Everyone needs access to the Internet and other digital tools, but some families cannot afford the quality access needed for work or school,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “ConnectHomeUSA seeks to bring the affordable digital access and equipment people need to get things done. We are narrowing the digital divide and empowering communities with equitable economic and educational outcomes.” This is the first time since 2020 that HUD has accepted new communities into the initiative. This phase of ConnectHomeUSA has expanded its reach to include not only Public Housing Authorities (PHAs), Tribally Designated Housing Entities (TDHEs), and Multifamily housing providers but also HUD Continuum of Care (CoC) and Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) grantees. Of the total number of communities accepted, 59 are joining the Tier 1 cohort, which consists of communities that are just beginning to address the digital divide. The program has also accepted 38 communities in the Tier 2 cohort, reserved for returning ConnectHomeUSA communities that have demonstrated a commitment to deepening their work. ConnectHomeUSA is a pivotal resource and approach to advancing digital inclusion for HUD-assisted communities. When combined, free/affordable internet, free/affordable devices, and digital skills training can significantly reduce barriers to economic and educational opportunities and help create a more equitable future for the residents HUD serves.

"Thursday, July 11, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_176,HUD Reaches Groundbreaking Settlement with The Appraisal Foundation to Ensure Equal Opportunity in the Appraisal Profession,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has entered into an historic Conciliation Agreement with The Appraisal Foundation (TAF), an organization responsible for setting standards and qualifications for real estate appraisers and providing voluntary guidance for all industry valuation professionals. This Agreement resolves a Secretary-initiated complaint against TAF alleging discriminatory barriers preventing qualified Black people and other persons of color from entering the appraisal profession on the basis of race in violation of the Fair Housing Act. Read the Conciliation Agreement here. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ 2023 data, the property appraisers and assessors’ occupation was 94.7% White and 0.6% Black, ranking as the least racially diverse of 800 occupations surveyed. As the Interagency Task Force on Property Appraisal and Valuation Equity (PAVE) makes clear, “[t]he lack of diversity within the appraiser workforce can contribute to patterns of mis-valuation in communities of color.” These patterns have been well-documented. According to 2021 research by Fannie Mae, 12.5 percent of appraisals for home purchases in majority-Black neighborhoods and 15.4 percent in majority-Latino neighborhoods result in a value below the contract price (the amount a buyer is willing to pay for the property), compared to only 7.4 percent of appraisals in predominantly white neighborhoods. This pattern of undervaluation can contribute to the racial wealth gap. Today, the median white family holds eight times the wealth of the typical Black family and five times the wealth of the typical Latino family. The complaint states that one of the reasons for the lack of diversity in the appraiser workforce is TAF’s experience requirement. This requirement allegedly causes aspiring appraisers to rely heavily on identifying a friend or family member who is already a licensed appraiser and willing to supervise on-the-job experience hours for licensure, thus perpetuating the homogeneity of the profession. PAVE identified this experience requirement as a significant barrier to entry for underrepresented and disadvantaged groups, including Black people and other people of color. The agreement provides, among other items, for increased funding for an alternative, more inclusive path for fulfilling the experience requirement. These new requirements bring us closer to correcting historic discriminatory patterns in the appraisal industry. “To help eliminate racial and ethnic bias from home appraisals, we must ensure that the industry looks like America,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “Today’s historic agreement will help build a class of appraisers based on what they know instead of who they know. This settlement will help bring us one step closer to rooting out discrimination in housing and opening doors to opportunity for all.” “HUD’s agreement requires policy changes that expand the pathways to becoming an appraiser, a change that will promote greater inclusion of Black people and other persons of color who have been the least likely to gain access to this industry,” said Diane M. Shelley, HUD’s Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. “This is a groundbreaking agreement, and I am grateful to Demetria McCain, who, during her tenure as Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of FHEO, launched the investigation and secured this conciliation addressing systemic issues that have perpetuated unacceptable inequities in the appraisal industry.” “Homeownership remains perhaps the biggest driver of a wealth gap that reflects wide racial and ethnic disparities in both the rate of homeownership and the financial return associated with owning a home,” said Melody C. Taylor, Executive Director of PAVE. “This Agreement reflects a major step forward in the journey to cultivate an appraiser profession that is well trained and supports the tenets of equal opportunity for all.” Under the terms of the Agreement, The Appraisal Foundation is required to establish a $1.22 million scholarship fund, which will be utilized to cover the cost of aspiring appraisers to attend Practical Applications of Real Estate Appraisal (PAREA) programs. The PAREA program is designed to provide an alternative pathway to fulfill the experience requirement to become a state licensed appraiser. The scholarships will cover the cost of the program, which will further encourage entry into the profession. The Agreement also includes terms for marketing the PAREA program and the scholarship fund to diverse communities as well as terms for evaluating the marketing’s effectiveness to those communities and persons of color aspiring to be appraisers. In addition, the Agreement includes terms for collaboration with state and territory appraiser regulatory agencies for PAREA’s adoption and credit towards the experience requirement for licensed appraisers. Although HUD did not issue findings prior to entering into the Agreement and the Agreement does not constitute admissions by The Appraisal Foundation or evidence of a final determination by HUD of violations of the Fair Housing Act, or any other laws based on the investigation, it is an enforceable agreement intended to resolve the issues raised in the Secretary-initiated complaint.

"Thursday, July 11, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_174,HUD Makes $40 Million Available to Prevent Evictions and Prevent Homelessness,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced the availability of $40 million in grant funds for eligible non-profit or governmental entities to provide no cost legal assistance to low-income tenants at risk of or subject to eviction from their homes. President Biden and Vice President Harris believe everyone deserves to live in a safe and affordable home. To ensure households have access to stable housing, HUD launched the Eviction Protection Grant Program (EPGP), a first-of-its-kind federal program to stabilize housing and prevent housing evictions through legal assistance, in 2021. HUD funded 21 grantees serving tenants across 19 states with $40 million during the first phase of the program in FY 2021 and 2022. Current grantees, as well as new applicants, will be considered for awards with this new round of funding. “This program exemplifies HUD’s focus on helping renters,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “We are releasing $40 million to support our local partners, who are providing a crucial lifeline to people who risk losing their homes, particularly people of color, who disproportionately face eviction.” As of March 2024, this program has helped over 35,000 households avoid eviction. HUD funding has helped these organizations rapidly improve and scale up their services and respond to emerging tenant needs. Most tenants served through the program are people of color and nearly half are from Black households. Nearly 2 in 3 tenants served have extremely low incomes, these are often living below the poverty line. The program continues to grow in impact as grantees expand their programs. “Each year 7.6 million tenants face the threat of eviction. Black households, especially women and children, are more likely to experience the lasting harms of eviction. Research shows that evictions contribute to increases in homelessness, unemployment and hospital use. And the rippling harms of eviction reach beyond affected households – destabilizing and straining neighborhoods, schools, municipal social services, and regional economies,” said Solomon Greene, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research. “We are excited for the opportunity to expand the program given the tremendous demand for these services. and we commit to sharing what we learn from grantee successes to provide models for communities across the United States.” The goal of the Eviction Protection Grant Program is to increase housing stability for low-income tenants through: Prevention: helping tenants avert eviction and prevent eviction filings and prevent displacement and risk of homelessness. Justice: helping tenants exercise and enforce their housing and civil rights and ensure the legal process during eviction is fair. Diversion: increasing tenant access to, and participation in, non-adversarial and more less costly resolutions with housing owners and landlords, outside of the court system. Relief: helping tenants avoid the harmful consequences of eviction and gain access to stabilizing resources like housing counseling. Grantees will also participate in research conducted by HUD’s Office of Policy Development and Research (PD&R) and will be expected to collect and submit data on services provided and associated outcomes. HUD is anticipating making approximately 25 awards of $500,000 to $2,500,000 each, with a total of $40,000,000 in grant funds available. The deadline to submit an application is August 20, 2024.

When final, the Servicing Defect Taxonomy will provide clear guidance to mortgage servicers regarding FHA’s servicing loan review process, FHA’s assessment of the severity of errors or non-compliance with its mortgage servicing policies, and the actions FHA may take in instances of servicer error or non-compliance. “HUD’s programs rely on the work of private partners, including mortgage servicers. We aim to provide clarity and transparency to these important business partners so that they can effectively use our programs to expand opportunities for sustainable homeownership,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “Today, we’re releasing a revised proposal to provide additional clarity and certainty for mortgage servicers, and we invite stakeholders to provide input to ensure that the taxonomy is as useful as possible.” “This latest draft takes into account the valuable feedback we’ve received from mortgage servicers, consumer advocates, and other stakeholders,” said Federal Housing Commissioner Julia Gordon. “The feedback has been instrumental in our formulation of a proposal that we believe offers the clarity and consistency long sought by mortgage servicers.” When finalized, the Servicing Defect Taxonomy will be incorporated into FHA’s Single Family Housing Policy Handbook 4000.1 and will be part of FHA's system for identifying and correcting servicing defects at the loan level. The taxonomy includes a structured categorization of discrete policy errors or violations by source, cause, and severity, ranked by tiers. “Posting this newly updated draft Servicing Defect Taxonomy is an important step in our ongoing work to increase transparency and certainty for FHA’s Single Family programs,” said Deputy Assistant Secretary for Single Family Housing Sarah Edelman. “FHA and lenders have had a positive experience using our origination defect taxonomy, and we expect this new tool will provide similar benefits for our mortgage servicing partners.” FHA encourages industry participants to view the draft posted today on its Single Family Drafting Table web page and to provide feedback by the August 26, 2024, deadline. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Tuesday, July 9, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_171,"HUD and FEMA Partnership Enhances State Planning for Housing Recovery, Builds Resilience","WASHINGTON - Today, FEMA, in partnership with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), published the Pre-Disaster Housing Planning Initiative Report to promote collaborative approaches to disaster housing recovery challenges and to bolster state planning for housing recovery before disasters occur. “I’ve traveled throughout the country to witness the aftermath of natural disasters and the devastating impact on communities, including my hometown,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “This partnership with FEMA is important to ensure that when another disaster strikes, recovery can occur quickly, and people receive the help they need.” This joint effort helps build local capacity and ensures states, Tribal Nations and territories adopt a proactive approach to housing recovery. A first-of-its-kind partnership between FEMA, HUD and states, the initiative was created to address these issues during blue sky days to help ensure individuals, families and communities can recover effectively from disasters. This type of planning also helps states move from short-term sheltering programs to more sustainable housing solutions. “One of the most heartbreaking consequences of disasters is when an individual’s home is damaged or destroyed, leaving individuals concerned about where their family is going to live,” said FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell. “Securing post-disaster housing is a major challenge for communities as they begin recovery. FEMA and HUD are partnering together to help communities identify and understand housing gaps before disasters strike to be better positioned to face these challenges head on and help survivors jumpstart their recovery.” Key findings in the report include the importance of identifying and addressing housing recovery challenges in a non-disaster environment, the benefit of information sharing among states and the value in tailoring federal support and resources to the unique needs and challenges of each state. Due to the success of this partnership, both agencies are working toward initiating a second cohort with new state partners. Disasters tend to exacerbate existing housing challenges like limited housing stock, rising rents and increased costs to vulnerable populations. Planning around existing housing shortfalls before disasters can help communities recover more quickly during emergencies and ensure more resilient outcomes. In addition to the report, a Pre-Disaster Housing Planning Checklist and Guide, as well as a Federal Housing and Sheltering Resource Timeline and Compendium were developed during the initiative and are available for states, Tribal Nations and territories to begin maturing their pre-disaster housing strategies. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Tuesday, July 9, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_170,HUD Expands Program to Help Homeowners Repair Homes,"The newly updated Federal Housing Administration Program will assist families looking for affordable financing to repair, purchase, or rehabilitate single-family homes. PHILADELPHIA - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, through its Federal Housing Administration (FHA), published a newly updated set of policies for its 203(k) Rehabilitation Mortgage Insurance Program. The changes announced today will modernize the program and enhance its usefulness for individuals and families seeking affordable financing for renovating or rehabilitating a single-family home when purchasing or refinancing it. The announcement was made this morning by Assistant Secretary for Housing and Federal Housing Commissioner Julia Gordon and Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker at the home of Kasan Simmons in Philadelphia, PA, a borrower who used the FHA 203(k) program to finance renovations to his home. “HUD has programs not only to help families purchase a house, but to help them repair their homes,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “Today, we are modernizing and expanding this program, helping both homebuyers and homeowners fix up their homes. This is one more action the HUD and the Biden-Harris Administration is taking to improve our country’s housing supply.” The 203(k) program allows borrowers to use FHA-insured financing to include the cost of rehabilitation or repair in a single mortgage used to purchase or refinance a home. The program covers structural repairs such as foundations and new roofs, modernization of kitchens and bathrooms, and projects to increase energy efficiency and climate resilience. The program enhancements are expected to meaningfully increase usage of the program and is an important component of the Biden-Harris Administration’s efforts to address the nation’s housing supply challenges. “Thanks to this crucial program, I was able to make renovations to my home,” said homeowner Kasan Simmons. “I’m ecstatic to see that HUD and the Biden-Harris Administration are making improvements to enhance and expand this program, so thousands more homeowners can make fixes to their homes.” “The changes we are announcing today for the 203(k) program are long overdue and will support greater use of this program where it is needed most – in neighborhoods where homes are affordable but need repair,” said Federal Housing Commissioner Julia Gordon. “Increased use of 203(k) mortgages will help modernize and revitalize homes, which supports affordable housing supply and strengthens neighborhoods.” FHA offers two variations of the 203(k) program: the Standard 203(k), which may be used for substantial remodeling and repairs, and the Limited 203(k), which may be used for minor remodeling and nonstructural repairs. Today’s enhancements modify both programs, and include: Increasing the allowable total rehabilitation costs a borrower can finance under the Limited 203(k) program from $35,000 to $75,000 and reviewing this limit annually to ensure it continues to keep pace with market conditions; Providing more time for rehabilitation and repair work to be completed by extending the rehabilitation period to 12 months for the Standard 203(k) and nine months for the Limited 203(k); Allowing the financing of the 203(k) Consultant Fee in the total mortgage amount for the Limited 203(k) if a borrower chooses to use a 203(k) Consultant; and Increasing the allowable fees that a 203(k) Consultant can charge for various activities, which have not been updated since 1995. The new fee structure is designed to appropriately compensate Consultants for their role and encourage more Consultants to participate in the program. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Monday, July 8, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_169,HUD Awards Funding to Help Families Find Housing in Neighborhoods with HUD Vouchers,"Awards provide support to Public Housing Agencies in developing plans for families to maximize housing and neighborhood choice. WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced $1.5 million in Housing Mobility-Related Services Planning awards to 25 Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) across 14 states. These funds enable PHAs to implement programs in their communities that help families using Housing Choice Vouchers (HCV) find housing in better-resourced opportunity neighborhoods. “Families deserve to thrive in better-resourced communities where the lasting benefits span future generations – like improved health, educational opportunities and wealth creation,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “Creating opportunities for families to live in neighborhoods with lower levels of poverty helps them achieve long-term success and reduces intergenerational poverty.” The program is based on HUD's Community Choice Demonstration program, which builds upon recent research showing that growing up in neighborhoods with lower poverty levels improves children's academic achievement, long-term success, and reduces intergenerational poverty. Studies have shown that children who move to low-poverty neighborhoods experience lower rates of hospitalizations, reduced hospital spending, and some improvements in mental health over the long term. Additionally, adults who move to low-poverty neighborhoods see reductions in obesity and diabetes. “These grants help communities convene a wide range of partners who are all essential to expanding options for families to find homes in neighborhoods of their choosing,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, Richard J. Monocchio. “We see the tangible benefit of this collaboration when families can assess what is best for them, especially the needs of their children.” While the HCV program currently offers families with vouchers the opportunity to live in a neighborhood of their choice (including low-poverty, opportunity neighborhoods), families with HCVs may continue to encounter barriers to using their vouchers in communities with expanded opportunities. Common barriers include the inability to save enough money for a security deposit, inadequate time to find a unit, landlord unwillingness to rent to voucher holders, or limited awareness of neighborhood amenities, such as the location of high-performing schools.

These documents will be available in Chinese, Korean, Spanish, Tagalog, and Vietnamese. The educational resources are accessible from FHA’s language access web page and will assist lenders, servicers, housing counselors, and other FHA program participants in explaining information related to FHA-insured mortgages to those with limited English proficiency prior to the execution of these documents in English, as required by law. This set of translations augments the 40 previously published translated mortgage origination documents and homeownership education resources already available to consumers. Together, these translated documents will remove language access barriers for FHA consumers whose preferred language is not English. “At HUD, we are working to ensure that homeownership is accessible to everyone who wants it – particularly for first-time homebuyers. To do that, we must make sure everyone has access to information about our programs. This common-sense action will help families achieve their dream of owning a home,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “Today, we are taking a crucial step towards a more inclusive, diverse, and equitable generation of homeowners.” “We continue to work to remove language access barriers for borrowers with FHA-insured mortgages. We believe it’s critical for borrowers to understand the options for purchasing a home and for accessing assistance if an existing borrower has difficulty in making their mortgage payments,” said Federal Housing Commissioner Julia Gordon. “With almost 60 mortgage documents translated into multiple languages, we now have a comprehensive collection of translated tools and resources for our program partners to use to more effectively reach those whose first language is not English.” Newly Available Translated Mortgage Documents and Education Resources The mortgage documents and information resources listed below are now available in Chinese, Korean, Spanish, Tagalog, and Vietnamese from FHA’s language access web page.

"Tuesday, July 2, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_166,HUD Approves Settlement with California Housing Providers Resolving Claim of Disability Discrimination,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today it has entered into a Conciliation Agreement between Burbank Housing Management Corporation, Burbank Housing Development Corporation, BHDC Parkwood Apartments, LLC, Oak Ridge Apartments Associates LP, and James Perez, requiring the respondents to pay $41,500 in compensation to the complainant. The Agreement resolves allegations that the respondents were in noncompliance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and also violated the Fair Housing Act by discriminating against tenants with disabilities. Read the Agreement here. The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination because of disability, including refusing to allow reasonable accommodations that would otherwise permit tenants with disabilities an equal opportunity to use and enjoy their housing. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504) prohibits the exclusion or discrimination of qualified individuals based on disability in any program receiving federal financial assistance, including from HUD. “Housing providers have a responsibility to provide reasonable accommodations so that tenants can safely enjoy their homes,” said Diane M. Shelley, HUD’s Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. “This action demonstrates this Administration’s commitment to enforcing our Nation’s civil rights laws and to ensuring equal access to housing for all.” The Agreement stems from a complaint alleging that the Sonoma County, California, based housing providers interfered with the rights of tenants with disabilities to obtain reasonable accommodations, and that the respondents, who are recipients of HUD and United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) funding, were in noncompliance with Section 504. The Respondents denied the allegations in the Complaint and agreed to settle the matter. The Conciliation Agreement does not constitute an admission of guilt by the Respondents and no determination has been issued by HUD in this matter. Under the terms of the Agreement, the housing providers will pay $41,500 to the complainant. The housing providers will also ensure their reasonable accommodation policies are in compliance with the Fair Housing Act and Section 504 and that they process reasonable accommodation requests in a timely manner. Both HUD and USDA will monitor the Agreement. People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 877-8339 (Relay) or at hud.gov/fairhousing. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Friday, June 28, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_164,HUD Launches New Resources and Research to Support LGBTQI+ Americans During Pride Month,"WASHINGTON - During this Pride Month, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) took action to protect LGBTQI+ Americans, taking crucial steps to uplift resources and best practices for housing providers, so no one must choose between being housed and feeling welcomed. This strategy is a collaboration between HUD’s Offices of Community Planning and Development, Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, Public and Indian Housing, Housing, and Policy Development and Research, demonstrating HUD’s united commitment to reducing barriers and protecting LGBTQI+ Americans. “Having stable housing is essential to the foundation upon which individuals can build a better future and thrive,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “This Pride Month, HUD has taken important measures to ensure LGBTQI+ individuals have the resources they need to find affordable housing and support in their communities.” On June 25, HUD released a PD&R Edge article that identifies barriers LGBTQI+ homeless youth and young adults (YYA) face when accessing shelter and stable housing, as well as best practices providers could take to support this population. Homelessness is a persistent and growing problem which disproportionately affects LGBTQI+ youth. In 2023, approximately 8,000 unsheltered individuals identified as transgender, a gender that is not singularly female or male, or gender questioning according to HUD’s Annual Homelessness Assessment Report. The article draws on more than six months of listening sessions with approximately 30 LGBTQI+ youth and 45 service providers across five metro areas. LGBTQI+ youth and young adults voiced the need for youth-focused affirming shelter spaces, trauma informed and culturally competent practices, sustained care and service continuity even after finding permanent housing, and more education on how to report instances of discrimination. “Today’s young adults are tomorrow’s adults and too many have been left behind, unsheltered and victimized by housing discrimination,” said Demetria McCain, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. “A healthy society is one that takes care of its most vulnerable which HUD strives to do.” “Over the past few months, the HUD team has met with LGBTQI+ youth and young adults and service providers in Atlanta, Memphis, Dallas, Prince George’s County, and New York City where they talked with us frankly about their unique needs,” said Marion McFadden, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary McFadden for Community Planning and Development. “They should be focused on building their futures but instead are struggling to keep a roof over their heads. Everyone seeking support in hard times deserves respect, so I am grateful to those who articulated ways to improve our programs.” This is not all – HUD also released another PD&R Edge article, which discusses actions to gather and safeguard data and support LGBTQI+ Americans. Since publishing the Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (SOGI) Data Action Plan in March 2023, HUD has made considerable progress in collecting, planning, and coordinating data, furthering HUD’s goal to support underserved communities, ensure LGBTQI+ Americans have fair and equal access to housing, and provide access to quality, affordable homes for all. “HUD’s SOGI Data Action Plan demonstrates the agency’s commitment and plans to assess, improve, and monitor the health and well-being of LGBTQI+ Americans over time. These data are crucial for developing effective strategies that address the specific challenges that LGBTQI+ individuals face,” said Solomon Greene, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary Solomon Greene for Policy Development and Research. “We are committed to integrating these insights and implementing equitable data collection in our research and policy development.” Additionally, HUD launched a new website that consolidates resources for the LGBTQI+ community. This new resource contains information for shelters and housing providers on how to comply with laws and regulations protecting LGBTQI+ Americans from discrimination and provide services in an inclusive manner. The website also directs LGBTQI+ people who believe they have experienced housing discrimination to file a complaint. In addition, the website assists individuals with finding assistance and shelter and links to important research that has been done on the housing needs of the LGBTQI+ community. These actions are only the latest effort in HUD’s continued work to address homelessness and provide access to affordable housing for LGBTQI+ Americans. For additional information on how the Biden-Harris Administration is supporting the LGBTQI+ community, please see the White House Fact Sheet on actions across the federal government. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Friday, June 28, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_163,HUD Awards $26 Million to Address the HIV Epidemic through Housing,"WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) awarded $26 million in Housing Interventions to End the HIV Epidemic program funding. This funding will go to 11 communities across the nation. Grantees receive a one-time award to fund housing assistance and supportive services for eligible individuals and families, coordination and planning activities, grants management and administration. HUD Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development Marion McFadden made the announcement alongside local leaders from Volunteers of America in Los Angeles, CA. “HUD is addressing homelessness and housing instability for the populations most impacted by the HIV epidemic,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “This funding will provide grantees and their stakeholders the opportunity to complement local efforts to end the HIV epidemic.” The Housing Interventions (HINT) to End the HIV Epidemic program is part of the Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) program. Unlike the majority of HOPWA funding, which is distributed through annual formula allocations, HINT is a competitive award aimed at promoting best practices in the field. “Earlier this year, HUD provided $455 million to 130 grantees through the HOPWA program to connect people with HIV/AIDS to housing and support,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary McFadden. “The awards announced today allow communities to continue driving forward best practices and sharing successes with the field.” Each awarded project will: Use Housing First principles to provide housing and services to low-income people with HIV and their families Align with new or existing local initiatives to end the HIV epidemic by promoting housing as a key strategy Improve use of available community resources and coordination among local housing and service providers Increase the amount of quality data collected and used for decision making with an emphasis on stable housing, positive health outcomes, and equity Assess and document replicable practices that ensure equitable access and cultural humility in providing housing and services for populations of people with HIV experiencing service gaps Prioritize sustainable, effective, and equitable approaches to providing housing and services to people with HIV and their families that can be continued past the funded project’s period of performance By the end of the grant period, each grantee will create a HOPWA Special Projects of National Significance (SPNS) Grant Model. This model will showcase effective practices and lessons learned in using housing to combat the HIV epidemic. These models will be shared publicly, and the insights gained will help shape national and community policies and actions. HUD joins its federal colleagues in efforts to end the HIV epidemic by contributing to action items and efforts in the National HIV/AIDS Strategy and the Ending the HIV Epidemic initiative through these HOPWA HINT SPNS grants.

"Thursday, June 27, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_162,The Federal Housing Administration Celebrates 90 Years of Making Homeownership Possible for American Families,"June 27, 2024, marks the 90th anniversary of the creation of the Federal Housing Administration under the National Housing Act WASHINGTON - Today, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) is recognizing the 90th anniversary of its creation under the National Housing Act of 1934, which was signed by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. HUD celebrated today’s anniversary with an event at its Washington D.C. Headquarters, which included opening remarks by HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman and Federal Housing Commissioner Julia Gordon. Attendees included past FHA Commissioners and leaders from the housing finance and advocacy communities. “The Federal Housing Administration has provided a path to homeownership for millions of people, and changed their families lives for generations to come,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “Under the Biden-Harris Administration, we are ensuring that FHA is accessible to everyone, particularly first-time homebuyers and people we have provided with fair access to homeownership in the past.” “FHA’s 90th anniversary is an opportunity to reflect on both the successes and challenges of the program throughout its nine decades, and to celebrate the enduring value FHA offers to this nation’s first-time homebuyers, borrowers of color, and underserved communities,” said Federal Housing Commissioner Julia Gordon. “As one of the first public-private partnerships, FHA has a rich history of supporting the nation’s housing system in all market conditions and making homeownership possible for those not adequately served by the private market.” FHA is the largest mortgage insurer in the world, serving a higher percentage of first-time home buyers, low- and moderate-income households, and people of color than any other mortgage channel. More than 91 million of the nation’s low- and moderate-income and first-time homebuyers have benefitted from FHA’s affordable mortgage financing since its creation, using FHA programs to build generational wealth through homeownership. More than seven million American households currently live in a home financed by an FHA-insured mortgage. On the commercial side, FHA currently insures more than 11,000 multifamily mortgages, which provide rental homes for more than 1.4 million individuals and families, as well as and more than 3,700 residential care and hospital facilities, which support access to quality healthcare in both rural and urban communities. Under the Biden-Harris Administration, FHA has made significant changes to the program to overcome barriers to homeownership, to increase the availability of affordable rental housing, and to support quality health care facilities. For example, under this Administration, FHA has: Served more than 3.4 million homebuyers and renters: Since 2021, FHA has served more than 2.9 million homebuyers, the vast majority of whom were buying a home for the first time, while also financing the rental homes of more than half a million individuals and families. Reduced costs for homebuyers: FHA cut its Single Family annual mortgage insurance premium by 35 percent in March 2023. From its implementation through May 2024, this reduction has saved more than 920,000 borrowers, an average of more than $885 per year. Together, these borrowers are saving more than $814 million through May 2024. Helped senior homeowners to age in place: Through its Home Equity Conversion Mortgage program, FHA helped more than 164,000 senior homeowners aged 62 or older to age in place. Supported greater access to quality healthcare: Under its Residential Care Facility and Hospital mortgage insurance programs, FHA insured more than 840 mortgages for nursing homes, assisted living facilities, board and care homes, and acute care hospitals throughout the nation. Removed barriers to homeownership: FHA increased access to homeownership for borrowers with student loan debt, those seeking to purchase manufactured homes or properties with Accessory Dwelling Units, and households with a strong history of on-time rental payments. Helped combat appraisal bias: FHA participated in HUD’s Property Appraisal and Valuation Equity Interagency Task Force and made sure that all its lenders implemented a clear process for borrowers to raise concerns about inaccurate appraisals, including improper racial bias. Assisted borrowers in avoiding foreclosure: Through its special COVID-19 forbearance and loss mitigation home retention options, including its new Payment Supplement Partial Claim, FHA helped two million homeowners to stay in their homes and/or otherwise avoid foreclosure through the period of the Covid pandemic. Supported financing of manufactured home communities: FHA has made cooperatives, non-profit entities and consortia, state and local governments, community development financing institutions, and Indian Tribes eligible to use FHA-insured multifamily loans to finance the acquisition of manufactured home communities. Implemented flexibilities to support affordable rental housing development: FHA made financing for the development of new affordable rental housing more accessible by increasing the large loan limit threshold for FHA-insured multifamily mortgages and restarting and extending indefinitely a risk sharing program with housing finance agencies and the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Federal Financing Bank. Supported energy efficiency and climate resilience measures for assisted housing programs. Through its Green and Resilient Retrofit Program (GRRP), funded under the President’s Inflation Reduction Act, HUD has awarded more than $754 million in grants and surplus cash loans as of June 25, 2024. These grants and loans will help finance energy efficiency and climate resilience measures at 139 properties participating in HUD assisted housing programs, many of which also have FHA-insured mortgages, and containing more than 16,400 rental homes for low- and moderate-income individuals and families. Furthered energy efficiency measures in residential care facilities: FHA extended its successful Multifamily Green Mortgage Insurance Premium to its Residential Care Facility mortgage insurance program, providing cost savings to facilities that meet industry-recognized energy efficiency standards. Key Events in FHA’s History June 27, 1934: The 1934 National Housing Act was signed into law by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, fundamentally changing the federal government’s role in housing and creating the Federal Housing Administration. 1940: FHA began paying all of its expenses from generated income. 1947: FHA began its insurance program for manufactured housing. 1950: The Housing Act of 1950 amended the National Housing Act to encourage the production of housing for middle-income families and established Section 213 for mortgage insurance on cooperative housing projects. 1959: FHA began its Section 232 program to insure mortgages for residential care facilities, including nursing homes. 1961: The Housing Act of 1961 authorized FHA’s Multifamily Section 221(d)(3) below market interest rate housing program for low-income rental housing. 1962: President John F. Kennedy issued Executive Order 11063, directing federal agencies to combat all form of racial discrimination and segregation in federal housing, which discontinued FHA’s reliance on racially discriminatory redlining. 1968: The Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 established Section 236 for the production of low-cost rental housing, and Section 242, which supported capital financing for hospitals. The 1968 Act also authorized the creation of a HUD Housing Counseling Program to administer a program for housing counseling agencies to provide counseling services to renters, homebuyers, and homeowners. 1974: The Multifamily Section 223(f) refinancing program began, which insured mortgages loans for the purchase or refinancing of existing multifamily properties with or without requiring substantial rehabilitation. 1987: The Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 established the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) reverse mortgage program that allowed elderly homeowners to borrow against their home’s equity as a means to age in place. 2008: The Housing and Economic Recovery Act (HERA) included the FHA Modernization Act which provided reforms to streamline and expand FHA’s loan programs. During the 2008 economic crisis, FHA played a vital part in supporting the nation’s housing market, demonstrating to a degree it never had before its countercyclical role in the housing market and providing continued access to mortgage financing for qualified borrowers amid severely constricted lending conditions.

"Thursday, June 27, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_161,HUD and Census Bureau Report New Residential Sales in May 2024,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Census Bureau jointly announced the following new residential sales statistics for May 2024: New Home Sales Sales of new single‐family houses in May 2024 were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 619,000, according to estimates released jointly today by the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. This is 11.3 percent (±15.5 percent)* below the revised April rate of 698,000 and is 16.5 percent (±16.2 percent) below the May 2023 estimate of 741,000. Sales Price The median sales price of new houses sold in May 2024 was $417,400. The average sales price was $520,000. For Sale Inventory and Months’ Supply The seasonally‐adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of May was 481,000. This represents a supply of 9.3 months at the current sales rate. The June report is scheduled for release on July 24, 2024. View the full schedule in the Economic Briefing Room. The full text and tables for this release can be found here. EXPLANATORY NOTES These statistics are estimated from sample surveys. They are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated average relative standard errors of the preliminary data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as “2.5 percent (±3.2%) above” appears in the text, this indicates the range (‐0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90‐percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. Changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show irregular movement. It takes 3 months to establish a trend for new houses sold. Preliminary new home sales figures are subject to revision due to the survey methodology and definitions used. The survey is primarily based on a sample of houses selected from building permits. Since a “sale” is defined as a deposit taken or sales agreement signed, this can occur prior to a permit being issued. An estimate of these prior sales is included in the sales figure. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimate of total sales is revised about 3.2 percent. Changes in sales price data reflect changes in the distribution of houses by region, size, etc., as well as changes in the prices of houses with identical characteristics. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found on our website. The Census Bureau has reviewed SOC monthly and quarterly tables to ensure appropriate access, use, and disclosure avoidance protection of the confidential source data (Disclosure Review Board (DRB) approval number: CBDRBFY23‐ 0307). API The Census Bureau’s application programming interface lets developers create custom apps to reach new users and makes key demographic, socio‐economic and housing statistics more accessible than ever before.

"Wednesday, June 26, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_160,Biden-Harris Administration Takes Additional Steps to Increase Housing Supply and Lower Housing Costs Across the Country,"Vice President Harris and Acting Secretary Todman announced funding for communities to eliminate barriers to building housing, production and launch innovative strategies to address local housing needs. WASHINGTON - Today, Vice President Kamala Harris and HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman announced that the Biden-Harris Administration is awarding $85 million in grant funding for the Pathways to Removing Obstacles to Housing (PRO Housing) program. PRO Housing aims to identify and remove barriers to affordable housing production and preservation, and lower housing costs. PRO Housing provides grant funding to communities actively taking steps and demonstrating progress in addressing needless local housing barriers to housing production. Winners of the PRO Housing competition will update state and local housing plans, revise land use policies, streamline the permitting process for housing construction, and take other actions to create more housing-forward communities. Grants will also be used to preserve existing affordable housing units, provide development subsidies to create new affordable units, and increase access to homeownership. “President Biden and I believe that every American deserves affordable housing, so they have a roof over their head and a place to call home. That is why we have a plan to build millions of new units of affordable housing in communities all across our nation, which will bring down the cost of housing for renters and help more Americans buy a home,” said Vice President Harris. “Today, I am proud to announce that we are taking a critical step forward by investing $85 million to help more than 20 communities throughout our country remove barriers to building more affordable housing.” Common barriers to housing identified in the PRO Housing applications include the high cost of land and development, lack of available units, underutilized vacant land and property, aging housing stock, inadequate infrastructure, displacement pressures, risks of extreme weather or environment hazards, and outdated, land-use policies, and permitting policies and processes. “President Biden and Vice President Harris have prioritized reducing housing costs,” said HUD Acting Secretary Todman. “As I travel across the country, I hear from people all the time, including builders, elected officials, and other stakeholders, about how difficult it is to build housing. This is why I am pleased to announce our first round of PRO Housing funding, which will provide communities with incentives to address their local housing barriers. This expands on our ongoing efforts to lower housing costs by increasing the housing supply.” The demand was substantial. HUD received considerable interest in the first round of PRO Housing funding. Applications were submitted from more than 175 communities – representing a wide variety of demographics, geographies and population sizes – across 47 States and territories. Successful applicants demonstrated a commitment to eliminating barriers to housing and progress toward creating more housing forward communities. The winners of PRO Housing are actively deploying strategies to boost housing supply, reform local regulations, incentivize development, prevent displacement, and encourage community driven solutions. Given the broad interest and urgent need to address housing supply, applicants will be provided technical assistance to address housing costs. Later this year, HUD will release an additional $100 million in funding available for round two of the competition. The President also included an additional $100 million for this program in his FY 25 budget. “The creativity and innovation demonstrated by communities’ housing supply proposals made it difficult to select the 21 winners. All across the nation, locally led, community-driven approaches have begun to close the housing gap,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development Marion McFadden. “This funding will accelerate the number of homes produced and rehabilitated and enable investments in community development.” PRO Housing awards will empower communities to continue to address barriers to housing construction and preservation and advance housing opportunities. Today’s announcement builds upon actions taken through the Biden-Harris Administration’s Housing Supply Action Plan and HUD’s Strategic Plan to boost housing supply, lower costs for families, ensure equitable development, and build resilient, sustainable communities. These actions are outlined in a fact sheet which was released by the White House earlier today. To highlight how each award winner is addressing their local housing needs, HUD has created PRO Housing Profiles for each awardee. Those profiles are available here.

"Tuesday, June 25, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_159,Biden-Harris Administration Announces More than $142 Million for Climate Resilience and Energy Efficiency Renovations in HUD-Supported Housing,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced more than $142 million in new grant and loan awards under its Green and Resilient Retrofit Program (GRRP), bringing the total funding awarded under this program to more than $754 million. These grants and loans from President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act will support significant energy efficiency and climate resilience renovations in more than 2,200 homes at properties housing low-income individuals, families, and seniors. This round of awards includes the first GRRP awards being made for properties in Puerto Rico and Louisiana. The funding announced today will improve the quality of life for residents by improving indoor air quality and by making their homes more resilient to climate hazards. These awards will also increase energy and water efficiency, generate renewable energy, and improve the quality of life for residents of affordable housing. They will also reduce climate pollution and promote the use of green building materials at these properties. HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman announced this new funding today in her remarks at the National Leased Housing Association Annual Meeting in Washington, D.C. “The Biden-Harris Administration has placed a priority on improving housing and boosting energy and climate resilience. Today’s announcement provides funding to carry out both goals,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “These investments will reduce costs and improve the living conditions of the families who live in these homes.” “These awards represent not just our ongoing commitment to improving the health and safety of the homes for low-income families, but the power of partnerships that use federal funding made available through President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act combined with private resources to combat climate change and promote energy efficiency,” said Assistant Secretary for Housing and Federal Housing Commissioner Julia Gordon. All of the investments announced today will advance environmental justice in line with the President Biden’s Justice40 Initiative, which sets a goal that 40 percent of the overall benefits of certain federal investments flow to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized by underinvestment and overburdened by pollution. Retrofitting these homes will reduce their carbon emissions, make them more resilient to extreme weather events, and advance the President’s housing and clean energy agenda, ensuring affordable housing stays affordable for residents and building owners across the nation. The grants and loans announced today are the third set of awards made under the GRRP’s Comprehensive category, which provides funding to properties with the highest need for climate resilience and utility efficiency upgrades. Of the 17 properties receiving Comprehensive awards today 14 are properties participating in the HUD Section 8 project-based rental assistance program for low-income individuals and families and three properties are participating in HUD’s Section 202 project-based rental assistance program for low-income seniors. Four properties have more than 200 units, five properties have between 51-200 units, and eight properties have 50 or fewer units. President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act—the largest climate investment in history—established the GRRP in 2022 to fund energy efficiency and resiliency improvements for HUD’s assisted rental portfolio. FACT SHEET: Green and Resilient Retrofit Program Progress to Date GRRP is the first HUD program to simultaneously invest in energy efficiency, renewable energy generation, climate resilience, and low-embodied-carbon materials in HUD-assisted multifamily housing. All of the investments under the GRRP will be made in affordable housing communities serving low-income families, directly benefiting HUD-assisted housing, in alignment with the Justice40 Initiative. As of June 25, 2024, GRRP funding has been awarded to 139 properties and more than 16,400 rental homes, to make them greener, healthier, and safer for low-income households, seniors, and persons with disabilities. The projects span the range from targeted upgrades to major net-zero renovation for properties in 39 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. As of June 25, 2024, HUD has awarded more than $754 million in grants and surplus cash loans under the GRRP; $383.5 million in grants and $370.9 million in surplus cash loans. Of the awardees receiving grants and loans in seven rounds of funding, 114 are properties receiving Multifamily Section 8 project-based rental assistance, 24 properties are receiving Section 202 project-based rental assistance for low-income seniors, and one is receiving Section 811 project-based rental assistance for low-income persons with disabilities. GRRP funding is being used for insulation, energy efficient windows and doors, heat-resistant roofs, energy efficient heating and cooling, resiliency measures and other improvements. GRRP is designed to work for properties of all sizes, and with a range of energy efficiency and climate resilience needs. More than 20 properties receiving grant and loan awards have fewer than 50 units, some 77 properties have between 50 and 100 units, while 17 have more than 200 units. More than 800 properties have also signed up for HUD’s free energy and water benchmarking service, funded with more than $40 million from the President’s Inflation Reduction Act, so that HUD-assisted housing property owners can better understand the energy and water consumption at their properties in relation to other similar properties. This benchmarking information can in turn be used to assess energy efficiency and water conservation upgrades that can be funded under the GRRP. Green and Resilient Retrofit Program Background Detail The GRRP Notices of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) and additional guidance detail the multiple funding options for which property owners may apply: Elements provides funding to owners for proven and meaningful climate resilience and utility efficiency measures in projects that are already in the process of being recapitalized. Leading Edge provides funding to owners with plans for ambitious retrofit activities to achieve zero energy retrofits and an advanced green certification. Comprehensive provides funding to properties with the highest need for climate resilience and utility efficiency upgrades, regardless of prior development or environmental retrofit experience.

"Monday, June 24, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_158,"In Case You Missed It: Amidst Record-High Extreme Heat, HUD Takes Action to Safeguard Residents","WASHINGTON - Last week, Americans from coast to coast faced the effects of extreme heat, with record-high temperatures posing a detrimental impact to businesses, homes, and entire communities. The Biden-Harris Administration and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) have already taken historic actions to protect families from these dangerous effects of the climate crisis. “In recent days, we have seen just how dangerous extreme heat is to the fabric of American communities – particularly our most vulnerable residents,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “HUD is assisting our partners on the ground to ensure that we protect the households we serve from the effects of extreme heat and keep families cool this summer.” On June 13, HUD’s Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing Richard Monocchio traveled to Tucson, Arizona to announce HUD’s new guidance to Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) to reduce the threat of extreme heat for residents. This guidance provides families with relief during severe or extreme heat periods, helping them afford to cool their homes. These new options allow PHAs to increase utility allowances for residents or forgo surcharges for the use of cooling, so that residents can use air conditioning during periods of severe or extreme heat. This guidance not only safeguards the safety and health of families but lowers home energy costs for residents in public housing by making it easier to request relief for excess utility expenses. This guidance provides PHAs with additional examples of cooling strategies to consider outside of providing air-conditioning. While HUD defines extreme heat as a period of high heat and humidity with temperatures above 90 degrees for a minimum of two to three days, this guidance allows for even more local control by allowing PHAs to define severe or extreme heat more broadly to support families in their communities. In April, as a part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s Earth Week initiatives, HUD published a webpage on Extreme Heat that serves as a hub highlighting actions communities can take to prepare and respond to extreme heat events and available resources to help fund climate resilience projects. HUD also shared two new technical assistance products: an Extreme Heat Quick Guide, to help communities plan for extreme heat and identify mitigation strategies, and a webinar on Extreme Heat and Cold, focused on community resilience. In addition, HUD held a stakeholder briefing to inform partners on resources to mitigate extreme heat on May 23, 2024. In addition, HUD is partnering with over 20 Federal agencies to participate in the National Integrated Heat Health Information System to build awareness about the dangers of extreme heat and develop solutions to reduce the negative impacts of extreme heat on communities throughout the country. HUD also joined the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to announce a plan to map urban heat islands across 14 American communities. These announcements are not the conclusion – every day, the Biden-Harris Administration and HUD work on new resources and opportunities to protect communities from extreme heat. For additional resources on extreme heat and to learn more about preparedness and response and available resources for climate resilience funding, visit HUD’s Extreme Heat webpage and the collection of resources at HUDExchange. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Monday, June 24, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_156,HUD Makes Over $469 Million Available to Protect Families from Home Health and Safety Hazards,"WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced the Lead Hazard Reduction Grant Program’s Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) that makes over $469 million in grants available to state and local governments to help transform communities by fixing older housing, preserving affordable housing, and improving the health of children and families in these communities. HUD’s lead hazard control grant programs have successfully filled critical needs for remediating housing hazards, focusing on the most vulnerable residents of communities with limited local resources to address these hazards. “Affordable, resilient, and quality housing is a priority of this Department, and these grants affirm HUD’s commitment to providing safe and healthy homes,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “By addressing and eliminating lead hazards in our nation’s homes, we are not only protecting the well-being of our children but also investing in the future prosperity of our families. Together, we can create environments where families thrive, free from the dangers of lead exposure.” Grants to state and local governments to be awarded under this NOFO will improve health and safety in privately-owned older (pre-1978) homes of low-income families under HUD’s Lead Hazard Reduction Grant Program – one of the largest health and safety investments to date for privately-owned housing. Within this NOFO, HUD is making available over $44 million in Healthy Homes Supplemental funding, supporting grantees’ efforts to control additional housing-related health and safety hazards in those homes in conjunction with the lead hazard control work, providing a whole home approach to addressing housing-related hazards. This funding contributes to HUD achieving its strategic objective to strengthen environmental justice by reducing exposure to health risks and environmental hazards, especially for low-income households and disadvantaged communities. Read the Fiscal Year 2022-2026 HUD Strategic Plan on HUD’s website. State and local governments have until August 19, 2024 to apply for this NOFO through Grants.gov here. HUD strongly encourages eligible applicants to apply for these critical resources that help transform communities by improving older housing. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

Read the Order. The Fair Housing Act (the Act) makes it illegal to discriminate in the sale or rental of housing because of disability, race, color, national origin, religion, sex (including sexual orientation and gender identity), and familial status. “It is illegal to deny a tenant the right to enjoy their home in a safe manner due to disability,” said Demetria L. McCain, HUD’s Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. “HUD is committed to ensuring that tenants with disabilities are granted the reasonable accommodations they are entitled to receive.” The Order resolves allegations the housing providers failed to grant a reasonable accommodation when a hearing-impaired tenant requested to have a service animal to assist with her disability. “The Fair Housing Act requires housing providers to grant reasonable accommodations, including the use of assistance animals, to ensure residents have full use and enjoyment of their homes,” said Damon Smith, HUD General Counsel. “HUD is dedicated to pursuing enforcement action when housing providers subject their tenants to unlawful disability discrimination.” Respondents agreed to resolve this case voluntarily, including through compensation to the individual affected and additional education and training for employees to ensure a better understanding of fair housing laws. People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 877-8339 (Relay) or at hud.gov/fairhousing.

"Friday, June 21, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_154,HUD Approves Agreement with Michigan Housing Provider Resolving Allegations of Discrimination Under the Violence Against Women Act and the Fair Housing Act,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has entered into a Conciliation Agreement with Michigan housing provider, Czapp Real Estate, LLC., resolving allegations that the Respondent denied housing to a woman because of her disability and status as a survivor under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). The Complainant alleged the landlord did not respond to her rental application due to her vision impairment and because she revealed a past tenancy was terminated due to experiencing dating violence and stalking. Read the Agreement here. The Fair Housing Acts makes it illegal to discriminate in the sale or rental of housing based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex (including sexual orientation and gender identity), familial status, and disability. Under VAWA, individuals living in covered housing programs cannot be denied housing, evicted, or lose assistance due to domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking. They also have the right to request an emergency transfer for safety reasons related to violence. “We have an ongoing commitment to enforcing rights enshrined under VAWA and the Fair Housing Act, ensuring equal access to housing for all,” said Demetria L. McCain, HUD’s Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. “Today and every day, HUD is taking action to root out discrimination in housing, protecting survivors and their families. With this Agreement, housing providers are on notice that they must comply with the law.” Under the terms of the Agreement, the Respondent will pay the Complainant $8,500. The Respondent will also take affirmative steps to ensure their policies, practices, and procedures comply with VAWA and the Fair Housing Act. The Agreement further stipulates that the Respondent will require all its staff to attend VAWA-related training. HUD’s new enforcement authority under the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2022 (“VAWA 2022”), which President Biden signed into law on March 15, 2022, enhances housing protections for survivors of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking applying for and assisted under covered HUD housing programs and certain other federal housing and homeless assistance programs. VAWA 2022 authorizes HUD to enforce the law by the same process as the Fair Housing Act. VAWA 2022 ensures the right to call 9-1-1 without fear of losing housing or other repercussions, and it prohibits retaliation by housing providers for exercising VAWA rights or assisting others in doing so. These protections apply regardless of sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation. People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 877-8339 (Relay) or at hud.gov/fairhousing. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

The transaction will enable the city of Pittsburgh to rehabilitate and preserve nearly 90 affordable rental homes at Manchester Commons, which comprises 56 properties in various locations across northwestern Pittsburgh. “At HUD, we are not just building new affordable housing – we are preserving affordable homes so they remain available for families into the future,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “Today, working with our local partners, we have closed a critical transaction to fund needed repairs.” Originally developed as a HUD Housing Opportunities for People Everywhere (HOPE) VI mixed-finance development in the 1990s, Manchester Commons consists of eight small multifamily residential buildings and 48 single family homes. This transaction will enable extensive renovations, including the repair or replacement of exterior structures such as roofing, siding, windows, doors, stairs and walkways. Interior home improvements will update kitchen appliances, plumbing equipment, furnaces, air conditioning units, and hot water heaters. Additionally, five homes will be renovated to comply with Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS) designation, two of which will be designated for those with hearing or vision impairments. “We are pleased to announce the availability of these funds to improve the homes of Manchester Commons,” said Assistant Secretary for Housing and Federal Housing Commissioner Julia Gordon. “This investment underscores our commitment to improving the living conditions for individuals and families and revitalizing the northwestern Pittsburgh community.” The total construction cost for the project is $18.7M, or approximately $217,000 per home, and will be financed through a combination of four percent Low Income Housing Tax Credits, funding from HACP, Moving to Work Housing Choice Vouchers, and the State of Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Friday, June 21, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_152,HUD Releases Updated Climate Adaptation and Resilience Plan,"WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development joined more than 20 federal agencies to release its updated Climate Adaptation Plan and expand the Biden-Harris Administration’s efforts to ensure federal operations are increasingly resilient to climate change impacts. The updated adaptation plans advance the Biden-Harris Administration’s National Climate Resilience Framework, which helps to align climate resilience investments across the public and private sector through common principles and opportunities for action to build a climate resilient nation. Communities from coast to coast are experiencing the impacts of climate change firsthand, as households face the effects of extreme heat and communities are damaged by increasingly dangerous disasters. In light of these impacts, the Biden-Harris Administration is taking action to assess, manage, and reduce the risks that climate change poses to the nation. To build a climate-resilient, energy-efficient, affordable housing stock, HUD is establishing protocols to ensure climate resilience is integrated in funding opportunities. For example, HUD is including climate change preference points in Notices of Funding Opportunities to encourage applications that invest in climate resilience, energy efficiency, and renewable energy. “If we want to build stronger, more sustainable communities, we need to address the real impacts of the climate crisis,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “This Administration and this Department are making investments to ensure that America’s housing stock is climate-resilient, energy-efficient, and affordable into the future.” At the beginning of his Administration, President Biden tasked federal agencies with leading whole-of-government efforts to address climate change through Executive Order 14008, Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad. Following the magnitude of challenges posed by the climate crisis underscored last year when the nation endured a record 28 individual billion-dollar extreme weather and climate disasters that caused more than $90 billion in aggregate damage, HUD continues to be a leader and partner in adaptation and resilience. “As communities face extreme heat, natural disasters and severe weather from the impacts of climate change, President Biden is delivering record resources to build climate resilience across the country,” said Brenda Mallory, Chair of the White House Council on Environmental Quality. “Through his Investing in America agenda and an all-of-government approach to tackling the climate crisis, the Biden-Harris Administration is delivering more than $50 billion to help communities increase their resilience and bolster protections for those who need it most. By updating our own adaptation strategies, the federal government is leading by example to build a more resilient future for all.” HUD released its initial Climate Adaptation Plan in 2021 and progress reports outlining advancements toward achieving their adaptation goals in 2022. In coordination with the White House Council on Environmental Quality and the Office of Management and Budget, agencies updated their Climate Adaptation Plans for 2024 to 2027 to better integrate climate risk across their mission, operations, and asset management, including: Combining historical data and projections to assess exposure of assets to climate-related hazards including extreme heat and precipitation, sea level rise, flooding, and wildfire; Expanding the operational focus on managing climate risk to facilities and supply chains to include federal employees and federal lands and waters; Broadening the mission focus to describe mainstreaming adaptation into agency policies, programs, planning, budget formulation, and external funding; Linking climate adaptation actions with other Biden-Harris Administration priorities, including advancing environmental justice and the President’s Justice40 Initiative, strengthening engagement with Tribal Nations, supporting the America the Beautiful initiative, scaling up nature-based solutions, and addressing the causes of climate change through climate mitigation; and Adopting common progress indicators across agencies to assess the progress of agency climate adaptation efforts. Outside of this Adaptation Plan, HUD is working to protect the families the Department serves from the effects of extreme heat, invest in climate resilience, and build sustainable communities. These include helping Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) provide cooling and air conditioning during periods of severe or extreme heat, publishing a final rule to help communities prepare for and reduce flood damage, and awarding over $611 million to improve climate resilience and energy efficiency for more than 14,000 HUD-assisted households.

WASHINGTON - To help keep residents safe in their homes, today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced that it will award $10 million to 65 Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) in 32 states across the country to make needed capital improvements in public housing developments that will enhance safety and security for residents. “Every resident deserves to feel safe in their home,” said Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “The Capital Fund Emergency Safety and Security Program provides critical resources to enhance the protection of residents, safeguard public spaces, and respond swiftly when they need help. These resources will help create a safer, more secure environment for everyone.” The funds are awarded through HUD’s Capital Fund Emergency Safety and Security Program, which supports public housing authorities as they address the safety of public housing residents. These grants may be used to install, repair, or replace capital equipment or systems that contribute to a safer living environment for residents, including security systems/surveillance cameras, fencing, lighting systems, emergency alarm systems, window bars, deadbolt locks, doors, and carbon monoxide detectors. “The Biden-Harris Administration has demonstrated its commitment to the wellbeing of residents and HUD stands in support of PHAs and residents working together to develop proactive safety plans responsive to specifically identified community needs,” said Rich Monocchio, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for the Office of Public and Indian Housing. “The investments we’re making through the ESSG program, like the one we’re announcing today in Western Pennsylvania, represent those commitments in action.” These funds also support the Biden-Harris Administration’s Comprehensive Strategy to Prevent and Respond to Gun Crime and Ensure Public Safety.

"Tuesday, June 18, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_149,Biden-Harris Administration and HUD Promote Homeownership with Over 60 Nationwide Events,"WASHINGTON - This National Homeownership Month, the Biden-Harris Administration and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) are highlighting multiple community events and engagements around the country organized by HUD and partners. Collectively, these events will help homebuyers across the country by highlighting available HUD resources and support services. “We are devoted to helping people purchase homes because we know homeownership is a key to building wealth,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “During the Biden-Harris Administration, HUD has helped millions of people become first-time homebuyers, but we know more must be done to help people overcome historical and financial barriers. This National Homeownership Month, we are doubling down on our work to advance homeownership opportunities.” Through the events, HUD joins President Joe Biden in commemorating this June as the 22nd annual National Homeownership Month and in working to ensure everyone has access to an affordable home in a community of their choice. National Homeownership Month also serves as a focal point for reinforcing, through multiple communications channels and direct outreach, the important role that housing counseling and HUD-certified housing counselors serve in reaching, educating, and assisting future and current homeowners. The events are being held coast to coast across rural and urban communities, from Bangor to Honolulu. Events are in Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, New York, Ohio, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, Vermont, West Virginia, and more. These events highlight initiatives to increase the supply of affordable homes, enable access to mortgage credit for first-time homebuyers, especially those from historically marginalized communities, and help current homeowners avoid foreclosure. This includes educational programs highlighting HUD resources, housing fairs and expos, trainings, roundtables, congressional briefings, and more. For example, HUD officials participated in several homeownership events in Ohio and California earlier this month and plan to participate in a Homebuyer Education Workshop and Expo hosted by the Atlanta Urban League in Georgia on June 29. HUD’s Federal Housing Administration (FHA) is the largest mortgage insurer in the world, serving a higher percentage of first-time home buyers, low- and moderate-income households, and people of color than any other mortgage channel. Over seven million American households live in a home financed by an FHA-insured mortgage. Through FHA, more than 730,000 households – including more than 223,000 borrowers of color – realized the dream of homeownership in fiscal year 2023 alone. In the first term of the Biden-Harris Administration, HUD has supported more than 2.9 million first-time homebuyers and FHA’s first-time homebuyer rate under this Administration is the highest it has been in over 20 years. HUD’s work to boost homeownership includes: Ensuring that positive rental history plays a greater role in determining creditworthiness when applying for an FHA-insured mortgage; Expanding the tools for Americans to access housing counseling; Removing barriers for people with student loan debt seeking to buy a home using a FHA-insured mortgage; and Cutting costs by reducing FHA mortgage insurance premiums, saving more than 680,000 people across this country save almost $900 in the first year of their mortgage. That is over $600 million in savings, just in the first year alone. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

The funding will support activities by these agencies to prepare and equip prospective homebuyers to successfully navigate the homebuying process and guide them to access the affordable homes they deserve. The announcement was made this morning in Harrisburg, PA, by Assistant Secretary for Housing and Federal Housing Commissioner Julia Gordon at the Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency, a recipient of one of the grants under the program. The Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency is receiving more than $479,000 through this funding opportunity to support their network of affiliates in delivering homeownership counseling programs to underserved communities throughout the state. “Under the Biden-Harris Administration, we are unlocking doors of opportunity for families to achieve homeownership and build generational wealth,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “This Homeownership Month, I’m proud to announce that we are awarding another $10 million to equip prospective homebuyers with the tools they need to navigate the process, which will expand homeownership to everyone who wants it.” The grants awarded today will enable HUD-approved housing counseling agencies to provide culturally sensitive and linguistically appropriate services for pre- and post-purchase housing counseling, with the goal of increasing homeownership rates among historically underserved communities. The funding affirms the ongoing commitment of the Biden-Harris Administration to help close the racial wealth gap and address homebuying barriers that disproportionately affect marginalized communities. “Housing counseling agencies play a unique and critical role in helping first-time homebuyers achieve homeownership,” said Assistant Secretary for Housing Julia Gordon. “Today’s grant awards will help housing counseling agencies throughout the country reach those who may never have believed they could own a home and help them to prepare for, enter into, and maintain homeownership.” “The Housing Counseling Homeownership Initiative is an innovative approach to linking funding for vital housing counseling with specific outreach programs geared to homeownership education and home purchase decisioning,” said Deputy Assistant Secretary for Housing Counseling David Berenbaum. “We intend to make this initiative a model for the funding of future programs that can directly and effectively serve first-time homebuyers in underserved communities.

"Friday, June 14, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_146,HUD Expands Support for Housing Counseling Services in Tribal Communities,"WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) Office of Housing Counseling announced that it published a final rule outlining housing counselor certification requirements for housing counseling conducted in connection with the Indian Housing Block Grant (IHBG) and the Indian Community Development Block Grant (ICDBG) programs. Housing counseling programs are an important tool to help further financial literacy – particularly for low- and moderate- income families. This can be the key to ensuring that potential homebuyers are set for long-term success and that renters avoid eviction. With this rule, HUD is removing previous impediments to participation in the HUD housing counseling program by Tribes, Tribally Designated Housing Entities, and other Tribal entities. HUD expects the rule to expand the number of HUD-certified housing counselors serving the unique needs of Tribal communities. “Throughout the Biden-Harris Administration, we’ve prioritized strengthening Nation-to-Nation relationships with Tribes by working to reduce historic barriers to housing access,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “After more than a year working with Tribes and Tribal Organizations on the proposed rule, HUD is proud to publish this final rule ensuring members of Tribal communities’ access to crucial housing counseling services tailored to their specific needs. We are committed to partnering with Tribes to increase equitable housing and support generational wealth building.” Both the proposed and final rules were informed by multiple Tribal consultation and listening sessions where Tribes provided input and feedback on HUD’s existing housing counselor certification requirements and the ways in which they should be tailored to meet Tribal needs. “Removing this barrier means that more Tribal individuals and families can be served by a trusted source within their community – a source that understands their unique cultural perspective and housing needs,” said Assistant Secretary for Housing and Federal Housing Commissioner Julia Gordon. “Tribal members have long been underserved in the housing market.” “This rule is the result of strong collaboration among HUD’s Offices of Housing Counseling and Native American Programs and Tribal representatives to remove a long-standing barrier to delivering robust and culturally sensitive housing counseling to Tribal members,” said Deputy Assistant Secretary for Housing Counseling David Berenbaum. “We look forward to welcoming more Tribal entities into the HUD housing counseling network.” With today’s final rule, HUD will implement a new category of HUD-certified housing counselor, called a HUD-certified Tribal housing counselor, and will implement a new Tribal housing counselor certification exam specifically for Tribes that will include adjustments for distinctions in fair housing laws pertaining to Tribes and the unique status of trust land. The provisions of the final rule establish a four-year transition period to allow Tribal grantees sufficient time to ensure that housing counselors can be certified. In addition, HUD will: Require that housing counseling that is funded with or provided in connection with IHBG or ICDBG funds is performed by individuals who are HUD certified; Facilitate additional training for counselors who become certified to provide housing counseling for the IHBG and ICDBG programs; and Modify study materials for housing counselor certification examinations to account for tailored content specific to Tribes. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Thursday, June 13, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_145,HUD Takes Action to Protect Families Against Extreme Heat,"WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced new guidance on the use of HUD funding to help mitigate the impacts of extreme heat for nearly 1.6 million residents in public housing especially for those most vulnerable, including older Americans, infants and young children, and people with chronic medical conditions. Effective today, HUD’s new guidance to Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) helps to clarify the steps PHAs can take immediately to reduce the threat of extreme heat for residents by providing families with relief during severe or extreme heat periods, to help them afford to cool their homes. These new options allow PHAs to increase utility allowances for residents or forgo surcharges for the use of cooling, so that residents can use air conditioning during periods of severe or extreme heat. Today’s guidance is consistent with the Biden-Harris Administration’s focus on lowering home energy costs for residents in public housing by making it easier to request relief for excess utility expenses. HUD Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing Richard Monocchio made the announcement today in Tucson, Arizona, with the local PHA, alongside city and state officials who are collectively responding to extreme heat conditions. “We must protect the health and safety of our families during increasingly severe weather events, like extreme heat, that can cause grave harm and even death to any member of our community,” said Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “As we transition into the Summer months, the need for public housing residents to access necessary cooling systems is vital and we are assertively taking these steps in the fight against extreme heat.” Extreme heat can greatly impact all people and is the leading cause of weather-related deaths every year. There are many ways to mitigate the effects of extreme heat in buildings and this guidance provides PHAs with additional examples of cooling strategies to consider outside of providing air-conditioning. While HUD defines extreme heat as a period of high heat and humidity with temperatures above 90 degrees for a minimum of two to three days, this guidance allows for even more local control by allowing PHAs to define severe or extreme heat more broadly to support families in their communities. “Home should be a place of comfort, and nobody should have to risk heat-related illness residing in their own home,” said Richard Monocchio, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for the Office of Public and Indian Housing. “This Notice makes it as easy as possible for PHAs to help individuals and families in public housing afford air conditioning and reinforces PHAs ability to create cooling centers for residents in public housing. We are providing maximum local control and decision-making for an issue that impacts more and more communities across the country each year.” PHAs can choose to provide relief to any family in public housing that requests it, for excess utilities charges due to severe or extreme heat. The new guidance helps PHAs respond rapidly to the threat of heat events and makes it easier for residents to request relief.

"Wednesday, June 12, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_143,FACT SHEET: Biden-Harris Administration Promotes Community Development and Business Growth,"WASHINGTON - The Interagency Community Investment Committee, currently chaired by Adrianne Todman, Acting Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), hosted a Roundtable and Listening Session to highlight the Administration’s accomplishments of place-based investments, boosting housing supply across the federal government, and small business investments. “Over the past year, it was my honor to lead the Interagency Community Investment Committee, focusing on investing in under-resourced communities and ensuring fair access to the opportunities created by this Administration,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “We are highlighting the progress our eight federal agencies have made in the past year, from expanding access to affordable housing to reducing barriers of access to capital.” Last June, the Interagency Community Investment Committee (ICIC) released its 2023 Action Plan; which outlined ambitious new actions to facilitate the flow of more resources into under-resourced communities across the country. Today’s announcements highlight progress on the ICIC’s inaugural plan to support cities and towns across the United States. This work builds upon the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to achieving long-term equitable growth by building an economy from the bottom up and middle out. Ultimately, this Administration’s efforts will unlock the economic potential of communities of color, low-income communities, rural areas, tribal communities, and other historically underserved communities, resulting in a stronger economy for everyone. The ICIC was created to improve the operational coordination of federal investment programs and maximize their collective impact. Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing that the ICIC agencies have collectively: Adopted a ‘No Wrong Doors’ for Small Businesses Trying to Access Capital The ICIC members adopted a ‘no wrong door’ policy to ensure that small businesses and entrepreneurs get the assistance and information most relevant to them. SBA, Commerce, Treasury and USDA have built a online tool for small businesses. They will soon distribute resource guides for small businesses across a nationwide network of field offices on the full suite of federal capital products and technical assistance programs. Supported community finance market development through access to secondary markets Agencies collaborated to build and scale infrastructure for community-financed affordable housing. HUD, through Ginnie Mae (GNMA), and USDA presented webinars to over 165 community-based lenders across the Federal Home Loan Bank districts of Chicago, Des Moines, Topeka, Boston, and Pittsburgh to scale their initiative of the Mortgage Partnership Finance® Program (MPF®). The MPF Program provides smaller mortgage lenders with access to the secondary mortgage market by pooling government-backed mortgages and securitizing them into GNMA-backed securities. Strengthened our understanding of federal community investment flows The ICIC launched a pilot to analyze the extent of federal community and economic development investments in twelve diverse communities, including urban and rural areas. The Departments of Treasury and Commerce led complementary research and analysis using data from ICIC agencies. The effort led to initial observations and recommendations on the flow of federal community and economic development funds in specific communities. Specifically, a need to align metrics and data to ascertain measurement of the cumulative impact. The working paper also highlights additional research opportunities that can be undertaken to benchmark and evaluate the economic impacts of investments. Read the full study here. The 12 communities analyzed are Toledo, OH; Pinal County, AZ; Carolina, PR; Las Cruces, NM; Rochester, NY; Whitley County, KY; Brownsville, TX; Boston, MA; Anchorage, AK; Macon-Bibb County, GA; Kansas City, MO; Pine Ridge Reservation, SD The Departments of Treasury and Commerce led complementary research and analysis using data from ICIC agencies.

Through the Rural Partners Network (RPN) USDA has built relationships with over 1,200 stakeholders and 384 new connections within socially vulnerable, distressed, and persistent poverty communities to receive direct support. Through the alignment of RPN and federal staff in collaboration with networks, a continued increase in federal application activity, federal investments, and new collaborations have continued to increase. This alignment has contributed to nearly $2.8 billion in direct federal investments into RPN communities, as well as the identification of technical and capacity building assistance facilitating increased capacity in communities to navigate and competitively pursue federal resources. USDA was able to leverage their partnership in the ICIC to host webinars with ICIC agencies on how new and existing programs impact and can be accessed by rural communities. The Departments of Transportation, Energy, Treasury and Health and Human Services as well as the Appalachian Regional Authority collectively reached 634 registered rural community members increasing awareness on how rural communities can access federal resources. Identified Opportunities to Improve the Alignment of Federal Investments to Maximize Community Impact, including expanding access to capital and affordable housing. Treasury expanded eligible activities under the State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds program to include HUD Title I Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) projects. New eligible activities will enable local jurisdictions to make additional significant housing, community development, and infrastructure investments. Treasury and HUD updated an Affordable Housing: How to Guide to showcase how housing developers can use SLFRF funds and describes how funds can be layered. To amplify these changes HUD and Treasury hosted a webinar, with 135 local governments in attendance, earlier in 2024. In March 2024, Treasury announced new efforts to increase the supply of housing in 2024. These measures will make it easier for SLFRF recipients to use available funds to boost housing supply and will allow Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) recipients to use their remaining funds for predevelopment and acquisition costs for affordable housing serving very low-income families. Treasury and HUD announced a new agreement to indefinitely extend the Federal Financing Bank’s (FFB) financing support for a risk-sharing initiative between HUD and state and local housing finance agencies. HUD created tools to connect climate resources with efforts to expand housing supply. HUD worked with USDA, the Departments of Commerce, Energy, Transportation, Treasury, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to identify resources under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and other recently enacted laws which can promote the development of fair, equitable, and affordable housing. HUD also published the Climate Resources for Housing Supply Framework. HUD also launched the Build for the Future, Funding Navigator, and a technical assistance website to support efforts to enhance climate resiliency, energy efficiency, renewable energy integration, healthy housing, workforce development and environmental justice. ICIC Agencies worked together to support deep community impact under EPA’s historic $27 billion Green House Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF) and continue efforts to increase awareness of funding opportunities through technical assistance and community engagement. In the coming year, EPA will continue to work collaboratively to align and promote the $27 billion GGRF with continued efforts around community investments and economic development, especially as it pertains to housing and small businesses. USDA and EPA have partnered to announce progress on wastewater treatment projects in rural communities coming out of EPA’s expansion of Closing the Wastewater Access Gap from 11 communities to 150 communities. Continued Public-Private Coordination There is a continuous need for coordinated actions between the public and private sectors to achieve sustainable community development. In 2022, the Vice President announced with the ICIC the formation of the Economic Opportunity Coalition (EOC), a private coalition of 30+ corporations and foundations committed to investing in underserved communities and entrepreneurs. Since then, the EOC has secured $1 billion in corporate deposits to Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) and Minority Depository Institutions (MDIs) to expand their lending power. The EOC is continuing this commitment by pledging to raise an additional $2 billion by late 2024. In October 2023, the EOC also issued a call to action for large corporations to strengthen domestic supply chains and build wealth for the underserved. The EOC asked companies in the Investing in America sectors to commit 15 percent of their procurement budget to small and disadvantaged businesses by 2025. Micron, Air Products, and Xcel Energy signed on to this commitment as first movers. The ICIC members include the Department of Agriculture (USDA), Department of Commerce (Commerce), Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Department of the Treasury (Treasury), Department of Transportation (DOT), the Small Business Administration (SBA), Department of Energy (DOE) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Friday, June 7, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_141,"HUD Closes $14.8 Million Transaction to Build New Affordable Rental Homes in Chapel Hill, NC","CHAPEL HILL - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Office of Multifamily Housing Programs announced the recent completion of a Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) transaction with the Town of Chapel Hill Department of Housing. Through the transaction, the Town of Chapel Hill contracted with Community Housing Partners of Richmond, Virginia to finance the construction of 54 affordable rental homes at Trinity Court Apartments in Chapel Hill, NC. “We know the key to bringing down housing costs – we need to build more affordable homes,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “Each and every day, we are building new homes to meet the needs of our growing nation. Today, thanks to collaboration with our partners, 54 new affordable homes will be built for families in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.” Built in 1975, Trinity Court Apartments consists of 40 affordable rental homes across two structures and has been vacant since 2018. The transaction supports the demolition and new construction of two mid-rise, energy efficient buildings. Additionally, the property will have many onsite amenities including a playground, picnic area, and several community spaces to enable residents of all ages to thrive in their community. “Building brand new homes is crucial to addressing the shortage of affordable housing options that is affecting households across the nation,” said Assistant Secretary for Housing and Federal Housing Commissioner Julia Gordon. “The Biden-Harris administration is committed to ensuring that individuals and families can live in vibrant neighborhoods with access to safe and quality housing.” The total construction cost for the project is $14.8 million, or approximately $275,000 per home, and will be financed through a combination of 9 percent Low Income Housing Tax Credits, a Commercial First Mortgage Loan, and funding from the North Carolina Housing Finance Agency’s Affordable Housing and Community Connections Department, the Town of Chapel Hill Department of Housing, and from NeighborWorks. About RAD RAD was designed to help address the multi-billion-dollar nationwide backlog of deferred maintenance in the public housing portfolio and to stem the loss of affordable housing that could no longer be kept to decent standards. From the program’s inception through June 1, 2024, the Rental Assistance Demonstration has facilitated more than $19.5 billion in capital investment to improve or replace over 220,000 deeply rent-assisted homes, most of which house extremely low-income families, seniors, and persons with disabilities. Under RAD, projects funded under the public housing program convert their public housing assistance to project-based Section 8 rental assistance. Under Section 8, residents continue to pay 30% of their income towards rent and the housing must continue to serve those with very low and extremely low incomes, as was the case when the property was assisted through the public housing program. Residents must be notified and consulted prior to conversion, are given a right to return to assisted housing post-construction so that the same tenants can enjoy these newly preserved and improved apartments and maintain the same fundamental rights they had as public housing residents.

"Thursday, June 6, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_140,HUD Makes $123 Million Available to Address Youth Homelessness,"Funding will provide new housing opportunities and improve community response systems to end youth homelessness. WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) awarded $51.1 million in Youth Homelessness System Improvement (YHSI) Grants to 38 communities across 26 states, Puerto Rico, and Guam. See list of awardees here. Additionally, HUD released a $72 million funding opportunity for the FY 2023 Youth Homelessness Demonstration Program (YHDP) and supportive services programs. These include rapid rehousing, permanent supportive housing, transitional housing, host homes, and wrap-around services such as education, health, and workforce support to help youth access and maintain housing. HUD Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development Marion McFadden made the announcement alongside local and tribal leaders in Bemidji, Minnesota. ""We know that preventing and ending youth homelessness takes a full community effort that requires support from all of our partners,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “HUD’s YHDP and YHSI grants will provide communities with necessary funding to address this issue head on and help build more seamless systems to help youth find stability, opportunity, and success.” The first of their kind, YHSI grants focus on systemic change to either improve or create response systems for youth at risk of or experiencing homelessness. These grants fund projects that: Create and build capacity for Youth Action Boards. Establish regional committees to direct efforts across multiple systems, including education, justice, and child welfare. Collect and use data on at-risk youth and youth experiencing homelessness. Develop strong leaders within a community. Improve the coordination, communication, operation, and administration of homeless assistance projects to better serve youth, including prevention and diversion strategies. The goal of YHSI grants is to create a more seamless and coordinated system of care for youth experiencing or at risk of homelessness. These grants aim to improve the identification of youth in need and make it easier for them to navigate available services. By helping communities build strong, resilient, and equitable homelessness response systems, YHSI grants reduce silos and break down barriers for youth in crisis. Recognizing that systemic change often extends beyond a single Continuum of Care, HUD has incentivized statewide or cross-community project proposals to emphasize the importance of coordination across communities. “HUD and our partners have been listening to youth across the country who are homeless or struggle with housing insecurity, said Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary McFadden. “One thing that emerged is frustration and confusion young people experience when navigating the many agencies, sectors, and services available to support them. This funding will allow communities to create a more seamless and coordinated system of care and enable better identification of youth and make services easier to navigate.” The FY23 YHDP Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) directly supports the implementation of coordinated community approaches in select communities, including providing direct assistance for tailored housing and services interventions for youth experiencing homelessness. This community planning approach supports the foundations outlined in a December 2022 plan by the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness: All In and will guide communities in designing solutions that match their specific needs with an emphasis on creating equitable strategies to assist youth who are most vulnerable, including BIPOC, LGBTQIA+, and youth with disabilities. All YHDP communities establish Youth Action Boards, where young people with lived experience of homelessness lead the community effort to design, implement, and improve programs and policies to end youth homelessness in their communities. This is the eighth round of funding under YHDP. Through the first seven rounds, HUD awarded YHDP funding to 110 communities, representing a $440 million investment into preventing and ending youth homelessness. Funding has supported innovative projects such as Host Homes and kinship care models, Permanent Supportive Housing for youth, peer navigators- youth with lived experience of homelessness who guide program participants as they maneuver complex systems of care. Both YHSI Grant recipients and YHDP selected communities will be provided technical assistance to support their community planning and project implementation processes. Technical assistance materials shared on the HUD Exchange are available to everyone and help to proliferate the promising practices learned through YHDP and YHSI Grants. The YHSI Grant awards, and this latest round of YHDP adds to the suite of HUD initiatives that support young people in gaining and maintaining stable housing. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Wednesday, June 5, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_138,HUD Finalizes Deal to Promote Energy Efficiency and Climate Resilience for New York Families,"The transaction is funded by the Inflation Reduction Act as part of President Biden’s Investing in America agenda to provide more comfortable homes for families. NEW YORK CITY - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) Office of Multifamily Housing Programs, announced it has completed a $192,000 loan transaction under the Green and Resilient Retrofit Program (GRRP) with L+M Fund Management to help finance energy efficiency and climate resilience renovations of the Revive 103 apartment community in New York, New York. This is the first transaction closing of a GRRP award in New York, with loan funds incorporated into the construction project to increase the energy efficiency and climate resiliency of the property. “Thanks to President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, we are making real improvements to lower housing costs and make the lives of the people we serve more comfortable,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “Today’s announcement will reduce heating and cooling costs and provide more comfortable temperatures for dozens of HUD-assisted households in New York City.” Revive 103 is a 60-unit, six-story building serving very low-income families. HUD provides project-based rental assistance to 59 of the households residing at the property. Originally constructed in 1920, the property is undergoing rehabilitation to update kitchens, bathrooms, and common spaces. L+M Development Partners will use the funding to preserve this critical housing stock and improve the quality of life for residents by tightening the building envelope, sealing all windows and openings in the exterior to reduce heating and cooling costs, which will provide more comfortable and predictable temperatures for residents, during extreme weather events-particularly during times of extreme heat. “We are proud of the work being undertaken by owners like L+M Fund Management throughout the country who are making use of this Administration’s Green and Resilient Retrofit Program funding to improve the lives of residents and communities,” said Deputy Assistant Secretary for Multifamily Housing Programs Ethan Handelman. “The rehabilitation work at Revive 103 is just one example of innovative use of public and private funds to make assisted housing properties healthier, safer, and more energy efficient.” About GRRP Funded under the Inflation Reduction Act, GRRP provides funding for direct loans and grants to make improvements to HUD-subsidized properties serving very low-income families, seniors, and persons with disabilities. Properties were selected through three distinct funding opportunities designed to meet the diverse needs of properties across the country. Funding can be used to improve energy or water efficiency, enhance indoor air quality, install zero-emission electricity generation and energy storage equipment, acquire low-emission building materials, implement building electrification strategies, or address and improve climate resilience. The program seeks to amplify recent technological advancements in energy and water efficiency and to bring a new focus on preparing for climate hazards by reducing residents’ and properties’ exposure to hazards and by protecting life, livability, and property when disaster strikes. HUD has offered funding through three GRRP award types targeting HUD-subsidized affordable housing: Elements awards provide modest funding for property owners to incorporate proven and impactful climate resilience and carbon reduction measures to the construction scopes of an in-progress recapitalization transactions. Property owners use the funds to add green or resilient elements to existing scopes of property rehabilitation. Leading Edge awards provide funding for property owners to meet ambitious carbon reduction, renewable energy generation, and resilience goals without requiring extensive technical assistance from HUD. Comprehensive awards provide funding for properties with the highest need for climate resilience and energy efficiency upgrades to undertake a deep retrofit, focused on innovative energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions reductions, green and healthy housing measures, renewable energy generation, and climate resilience investments. Comprehensive Awards are designed for the widest range of properties and are accompanied by direct support from HUD to achieve the retrofit. FACT SHEET: Green and Resilient Retrofit Program Progress to Date GRRP is the first HUD program to simultaneously invest in energy efficiency, renewable energy generation, climate resilience, and low-embodied-carbon materials in HUD-assisted multifamily housing. All of the investments under the GRRP will be made in affordable housing communities serving low-income families, directly benefiting HUD-assisted housing, in alignment with the Justice40 Initiative. As of May 21, 2024, GRRP funding has been awarded to 122 properties and more than 14,000 rental homes, to make them greener, healthier, and safer for low-income households, seniors, and persons with disabilities. The projects span the range from targeted upgrades to major net-zero renovation for properties in 36 states and the District of Columbia As of May 21, 2024, HUD has awarded more than $610 million in grants and surplus cash loans under the GRRP; $255.5 million in grants and $355.8 million in surplus cash loans. Of the awardees receiving grants and loans in seven rounds of funding, 99 are properties receiving Multifamily Section 8 project-based rental assistance, 21 properties are receiving Section 202 project-based rental assistance for low-income seniors, and one is receiving Section 811 project-based rental assistance for low-income persons with disabilities. GRRP is designed to work for properties of all sizes, and with a range of energy efficiency and climate resilience needs. More than 20 properties receiving grant and loan awards have fewer than 50 units, some 77 properties have between 50 and 100 units, while 17 have more than 200 units. More than 800 properties have also signed up for HUD’s free energy and water benchmarking service, funded with more than $40 million from the President’s Inflation Reduction Act, so that HUD-assisted housing property owners can better understand the energy and water consumption at their properties in relation to other similar properties. This benchmarking information can in turn be used to assess energy efficiency and water conservation upgrades that can be funded under the GRRP.

"Tuesday, June 4, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_137,HUD Launches New Program to Invest in Manufactured Home Communities,"New program offers affordable financing for organizations to purchase or refinance and revitalize manufactured home communities to lower housing costs across the country. WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, through the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), announced the launch of its new Manufactured Home Community loan product, which will provide an FHA-insured financing option for the purchase, refinance, and revitalization of manufactured home communities. This action will help entities to preserve, stabilize, and revitalize these vital sources of affordable housing. The announcement was made this morning by HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman at a media preview for the 2024 Innovative Housing Showcase on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. “Manufactured home communities offer a stable and affordable housing option for many families. Today, HUD is providing new resources for preserving and revitalizing these communities by providing FHA-insured financing to mission-focused groups to buy or refinance and revitalize manufactured homes,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “This is just one of many ways HUD is empowering residents, industry leaders, and governments to expand access to innovative, affordable housing solutions, particularly in rural communities.” Beginning today, certain mission-focused entities such as resident-owned manufactured home communities, cooperatives, non-profit entities and consortia, state and local governments, community development financing institutions, and Indian Tribes, will be eligible to use this program to finance the acquisition of or to improve existing communities, including making updates to common area resources and helping to maintain rent affordability. This tool provides an alternative to purchase of these communities by private equity funds and similar financial interests, whose track record reportedly includes unaffordable rent increases, failure to invest in community infrastructure, and regulations that don’t respect the community’s culture. This permanent financing tool complements HUD’s recently announced PRICE program, which offers competitive grant opportunities for investments in affordable manufactured home communities. HUD estimates that more than 5,000 individuals and families, based on average community size, could benefit from the program within the next five years. This Manufactured Home Communities program leverages FHA’s Multifamily 223(f) program, which will now provide permanent mortgage financing for manufactured home communities that may have previously been ineligible, and for previously ineligible manufactured home cooperative borrowers to be eligible to acquire and obtain financing for existing communities. “With this product, HUD aims to support resident-owned communities and other mission-focused owners who are committed to high-quality, affordable manufactured housing that is not at risk of exorbitant land rent increases that jeopardize the stability of their homes and futures,” said Assistant Secretary for Housing and Federal Housing Commissioner Julia Gordon. “Today’s announcement is an important first step for a program that we hope will provide a meaningful path to both affordable manufactured home community creation and preservation,” said Deputy Assistant Secretary for Multifamily Housing Programs Ethan Handelman. “As we progress with the program implementation, we will continue to assess both its scope and entity eligibility.” ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Tuesday, June 4, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_135,HUD Celebrates Annual National Homeownership Month,"The June celebration reinforces the Biden-Harris Administration's commitment to supporting affordable homeownership and lowering housing costs for American families. WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) joined President Joe Biden to celebrate June as the 22nd Annual National Homeownership Month. During National Homeownership Month, HUD is proud to double down on its ongoing leadership and commitment to helping Americans achieve the dream of homeownership and to supporting the stability and economic well-being of individuals and families across the nation. HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman shared a statement on Homeownership Month: Homeownership is the way many people in the U.S. build wealth, but the dream of owning a home of one’s own feels out of reach for many Americans, especially people of color, young people, and people with low incomes who face historical and financial barriers to homeownership. Our goal is to help people purchase homes they can afford, including starter homes. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has taken decisive action to expand access to homeownership by supporting housing counseling and down payment assistance, reducing barriers for those with student loan debt, allowing positive rental history to impact someone’s chances of obtaining an FHA-insured mortgage, and lowering mortgage insurance premiums on FHA mortgages. Taken together, these strategic policy changes have helped millions of people become homeowners, including 2.5 million first-time homebuyers. But we know there is more to do. That’s why, this National Homeownership Month, HUD is doubling down on its work to advance homeownership opportunities for all who want them. Since Day One, the Biden-Harris Administration has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to expanding equitable access to the stability and wealth building potential of homeownership, and HUD has taken multiple actions to enable more households to achieve and maintain homeownership. Throughout National Homeownership Month, HUD will host a series of events and engagements to amplify these efforts and increase awareness of the many tools and opportunities available to assist first-time homebuyers, low-and moderate-income individuals and families, and borrowers of color in acquiring a home. ""Homeownership promotes stability and healthy outcomes, builds intergenerational wealth, and ultimately is fundamental to America's promise of opportunity,” said Assistant Secretary for Housing and Federal Housing Commissioner Julia Gordon. “During National Homeownership Month, we plan to showcase our work to break down barriers to homeownership, close the racial wealth gap, and ensure that every family has the opportunity to build a better future."" HUD’s Federal Housing Administration (FHA) is the largest mortgage insurer in the world, serving a higher percentage of first-time home buyers, low- and moderate-income households, and people of color than any other mortgage channel. Over seven million American households live in a home financed by an FHA-insured mortgage. Through FHA, 732,319 households – including 223,882 borrowers of color – realized the dream of homeownership in fiscal year 2023 alone. Over the past year, HUD has taken these steps: Completed one year since reducing its annual mortgage insurance premium by 35 percent, saving over 682,000 borrowers an average of about $876 per year. Together, these borrowers are saving nearly $600 million in the first year of their mortgages. Expanded language access resources to provide multilingual educational resources to the nation’s growing diverse population and remove barriers to homeownership for those who have limited English proficiency. More than 40 FHA homeownership documents and other educational resources are now available in Chinese, Korean, Spanish, Tagalog, and Vietnamese on the Language Access Resources page. Updated its policies to provide greater qualifying flexibility for borrowers purchasing homes with accessory dwelling units (ADUs), which add to the supply of affordable rental housing. This new policy will enable more homebuyers to leverage the power of ADUs to enhance the wealth building potential of homeownership. Required lenders to strengthen their Reconsideration of Value processes, which enable borrowers to request a re-assessment of the appraised value of their property if they believe that the appraisal was inaccurate or biased. This effort supports the work outlined in the Biden-Harris Administration’s Property Appraisal and Valuation Equity Interagency Task Force. Made $85 million available in competitive grants for communities to identify and remove barriers to affordable housing production and preservation. Streamlined the nation’s largest affordable housing grant program – the HOME Investment Partnership Program – to reduce administrative burden for communities and housing developers, improve assistance and protections for renters, strengthen the use of HOME for homeownership activities, and encourage green and climate resilient building practices. Created a new loss mitigation tool – FHA’s Payment Supplement Partial Claim – to help borrowers avoid foreclosure and retain their homes when other FHA home retention options are unable to generate a sustainable monthly mortgage payment. Invested $84 million to transform residents’ lives, equipping them with the tools to achieve financial stability, attain families’ goals, and build generational wealth and economic mobility. Continued its work to update the Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards, commonly called the HUD Code. When completed later this summer, changes to the Code will provide greater flexibility for the manufacture of safe, affordable, and efficient manufactured housing. Launched a $10 million Homeownership Initiative funding opportunity to directly support housing counseling services for prospective homebuyers in underserved communities.

"Monday, June 3, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_136,HUD and VA Make $78 Million Available to Help Homeless Veterans Find Permanent Housing,"WASHINGTON - Today, The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is making $78 million available in HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) vouchers to Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) across the country, for over 7,000 vouchers. Through this program, HUD and VA’s mission is to end homelessness by assisting veterans and their families in obtaining permanent and sustainable housing with access to high-quality health care and supportive services, and to ensure that homelessness is otherwise prevented. “We want to put an end to Veteran’s homelessness and the HUD-VASH program is one of our most valuable resources to help us reach that goal,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “HUD is committed to working with housing agencies and Veteran Affairs Medical Centers across the country to get veterans off the street and into apartments they can afford. We owe them that.” “One Veteran experiencing homelessness will always be one too many — and we will do everything in our power to ensure that Veterans get the safe, stable housing they deserve,” said VA Secretary Denis McDonough. “These vouchers are a critical part of that effort, empowering VA, HUD, and our partners to provide more housing and wraparound services to more homeless and at-risk Veterans. Together, we will not rest until Veteran homelessness is a thing of the past.” The HUD-VASH program for veterans experiencing homelessness combines HUD’s Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) rental assistance with case management and clinical services provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). VA provides these services for participating Veterans at VA medical centers, community-based outreach clinics (CBOCs), through VA contractors, or through other VA designated entities. Thanks to the joint efforts of HUD, VA, and the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness, the number of Veterans experiencing homelessness has fallen by 5% since early 2020, and by 52% since 2010. Additionally, VA and HUD partnered to permanently house more than 46,000 homeless Veterans in 2023, surpassing the calendar year goal by 22.5%. Currently, there are over 113,000 HUD-VASH vouchers being administered by over 750 PHAs. Since 2008 HUD has issued new HUD-VASH vouchers every year. Additionally, over 85,000 of those total vouchers are actively under lease by HUD-VASH veterans, with many additional veterans having been issued vouchers and currently searching for housing to lease.

DENVER - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced $44 million in Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 funding through the Family Self Sufficiency (FSS) Program and the Resident Opportunity and Self-Sufficiency (ROSS) Service Coordinator Program. Funding from both programs, will be used to equip residents with the tools and resources they need to achieve financial independence, attain families’ goals, and build generational wealth and economic mobility. The Acting Secretary Todman made the announcement at the Westwood Opportunity Center in Denver, Colorado. “At HUD, part of our work includes empowering people to navigate everyday challenges,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “The funding announced today provides a foundation for personal and financial growth that will help families achieve their families’ goals and attain economic justice.” The FSS program is a voluntary initiative offered to families in HUD-assisted housing. FSS Program Coordinators provide coaching and develop local strategies to connect participating families with public and private resources aimed at increasing their earned income and financial empowerment. These efforts also seek to reduce or eliminate the need for welfare assistance and facilitate progress toward economic independence and self-sufficiency. The ROSS Service Coordinator program provides funding to hire and maintain service coordinators. These coordinators assess the needs of residents in conventional public housing or Indian housing and coordinate available community resources to meet those needs. This place-based program targets the entire resident community, aiming to connect public and private resources to empower residents of public housing. Later today, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, Richard Monocchio, will be making a separate award announcement in Flint, Michigan alongside new award recipients from the Flint Housing Commission and the Birch Park Apartments multifamily housing partners from Saginaw, Michigan. “As we continue to expand housing supply and improve housing affordability, we are just as focused on ensuring that residents have the supports and services, they need to reach opportunities and meet their goals,” said Richard Monocchio, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing. “There’s nothing more inspiring than seeing individuals and families building for their future and the future of their children when they’re given the opportunity to achieve their dreams with help from programs like FSS and ROSS. In addition, HUD released the FY 2024 ROSS program Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) that will provide $40 million for eligible entities to apply. This three-year grant will help pay for service coordinators at target developments. ROSS and FSS funding play a pivotal role in helping families achieve economic independence and enhance their quality of life. By offering comprehensive support services such as job training, financial literacy education, and health and wellness programs, these initiatives provide families with the tools they need to overcome barriers and pursue their goals. Through personalized case management and the innovative escrow savings account, FSS funding helps participants build financial security and plan for their future. Together, ROSS and FSS funding are not just assistance programs; they are powerful catalysts for transformation and autonomy in our communities. Eligible applicants can apply here.

"Thursday, May 30, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_131,HUD Charges Puerto Rico Homeowner’s Association with Disability Discrimination,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced today it has charged Consejo de Titulares del Condominio Italia 2027 (the “Condominium Italia 2027 Council of Owners”), the homeowners association for a condominium in San Juan, Puerto Rico, with violating the Fair Housing Act by revoking its approval and refusing to allow an owner with a disability to power the self-installed elevator in her 3-story unit with an external generator. Read the Charge. The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination because of disability, including the refusal to allow reasonable accommodations or modifications that would permit homeowners with disabilities an equal opportunity to use and enjoy their housing. One example of reasonable accommodation can be a waiver of a policy that would prevent a person from being able to fully use and enjoy their home. In this case, a reasonable modification request includes allowing the homeowner, at her own expense, to make structural changes to the property to use and enjoy her home. “Failure to permit an individual with disabilities reasonable accommodation and reasonable modification when such accommodation or modification is necessary is a failure to provide housing,” said Demetria L. McCain, HUD Principal Assistant Deputy Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. “HUD is committed to protecting the rights of individuals with disabilities by enforcing the Act.” ""It is the right of all residents to seek reasonable modifications as necessary to allow them full access to their home,"" said HUD's General Counsel Damon Smith. ""HUD is committed to ensuring that homeowners like the complainant in this case have the accessibility features they need to fully enjoy their home."" HUD’s Charge of Discrimination alleges that Condominium Italia 2027 Council of Owners, the Respondent, revoked its prior approval of a modification the owner made to the façade of the property to allow an elevator within her multi-story unit, and an external generator to power the elevator in case of power outage. The Charge further alleges that the homeowner’s association denied the owner’s request for reasonable accommodation of a policy related to noise that prevented her from using a generator to power the elevator in her unit. Because of the homeowner’s association’s actions, the owner was ultimately forced to leave her home as she could not move about her 3-story unit without the elevator. A United States Administrative Law Judge will hear HUD’s charge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds, after a hearing, that discrimination has occurred, they may award damages to the individuals for their losses from the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive and other equitable relief to deter further discrimination, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties to vindicate the public interest. If the federal court hears the case, the judge may also award punitive damages to the complainant. People who believe they are the victims of housing discrimination should contact HUD at (800) 669-9777 (voice) 800-927-9275 (TTY) or the Department of Justice at (800) 896-7743 or 202-514-4713.

This funding is designated for affordable housing projects benefiting low-income families in American Indian and Alaska Native communities through the Indian Housing Block Grant (IHBG) Competitive program. The announcement was made by HUD Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, Richard Monocchio, during a tour with Tribal leaders from the Nottawaseppi Huron Band of the Potawatomi near Kalamazoo, MI. They visited a home construction site funded with a prior year competitive grant award. ""Ensuring affordable housing for Native American communities is a top priority for HUD,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. ""We take pride in partnering with Tribes to expand housing options and foster resilient communities, laying the foundation for generations to thrive.” HUD will award the $150 million through the IHBG Competition supporting Tribes and Tribally Designated Housing Entities (TDHEs) to carry out affordable housing activities. HUD will prioritize funding for new housing construction projects, housing rehabilitation projects, and necessary affordable housing-related infrastructure projects. “It’s an honor to be welcomed by the Nottawaseppia Huron Band of the Potawatomi to see the incredible homes they have built through the Indian Housing Block Grant Competitive program,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary Monocchio. “These awards are having a major impact on the shortage of affordable housing in Native American communities, and we are excited to see many more homes built with the funds we make available today.” Under the IHBG Competition, eligible applicants receive grants primarily to construct new affordable housing in safe and healthy environments in Tribal communities. A 2017 HUD Housing Needs Study concluded that 68,000 new homes are needed to replace substantially dilapidated homes and to address severe overcrowding in Tribal communities. These grant funds will help Tribes build new homes to improve housing conditions for Tribal members and help address some of this need.

This funding from the Inflation Reduction Act—the largest climate investment in history—will support energy efficiency and climate resilience renovations for the Palmer Park apartment community in Glendale, California that will help reduce housing costs and increase preservation of affordable housing. Notably, Palmer Park, a 12-unit, two-story building serving low-income individuals and families, marks the first integration of a GRRP award into a construction project in California, strengthening its ability to withstand environmental challenges while optimizing energy usage. “Under this Administration, we are not just talking the talk on climate resilience and energy efficiency – we are making things happen,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “Today, we are delivering a deal to make crucial green upgrades for families in Glendale, California, ensuring these affordable rental households are efficient and resilient for the future.” Palmer Park receives rental assistance from HUD's Section 8 program for all 12 households. Built in 1983, the property is undergoing rehabilitation to improve energy and water efficiency, with upgrades including Energy Star windows and refrigerators, a new roof, low-flow plumbing fixtures, exhaust fans and LED lighting. These enhancements are funded by HUD's GRRP. “This first GRRP transaction to close in California showcases the ability of Green and Resilient Retrofit Program funding to help properties of all sizes become safer, more energy efficient, and healthier,” said Deputy Assistant Secretary for Multifamily Housing Programs Ethan Handelman. “Financing these important upgrades at Palmer Park, and similar properties throughout the country will improve the lives of residents and highlights this Administration’s dedication to addressing both affordable housing and climate change.” About GRRP Funded under the Inflation Reduction Act, GRRP provides funding for direct loans and grants to make improvements to HUD-subsidized properties serving very low-income families, seniors, and persons with disabilities. Properties were selected through three distinct funding opportunities designed to meet the diverse needs of properties across the country. Funding can be used to improve energy or water efficiency, enhance indoor air quality, install zero-emission electricity generation and energy storage equipment, acquire low-emission building materials, implement building electrification strategies, or address and improve climate resilience. The program seeks to amplify recent technological advancements in energy and water efficiency and to bring a new focus on preparing for climate hazards by reducing residents’ and properties’ exposure to hazards and by protecting life, livability, and property when disaster strikes. HUD has offered funding through three GRRP award types targeting HUD-subsidized affordable housing: Elements awards provide modest funding for property owners to incorporate proven and impactful climate resilience and carbon reduction measures to the construction scopes of an in-progress recapitalization transactions. Property owners use the funds to add green or resilient elements to existing scopes of property rehabilitation. Leading Edge awards provide funding for property owners to meet ambitious carbon reduction, renewable energy generation, and resilience goals without requiring extensive technical assistance from HUD. Comprehensive awards provide funding for properties with the highest need for climate resilience and energy efficiency upgrades to undertake a deep retrofit, focused on innovative energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions reductions, green and healthy housing measures, renewable energy generation, and climate resilience investments. Comprehensive Awards are designed for the widest range of properties and are accompanied by direct support from HUD to achieve the retrofit. FACT SHEET: Green and Resilient Retrofit Program Progress to Date GRRP is the first HUD program to simultaneously invest in energy efficiency, renewable energy generation, climate resilience, and low-embodied-carbon materials in HUD-assisted multifamily housing that leads to housing affordability and preservation. All of the investments under the GRRP will be made in affordable housing communities serving low-income families, directly benefiting HUD-assisted housing, in alignment with the Justice40 Initiative. As of May 21, 2024, GRRP funding has been awarded to 122 properties and more than 14,000 rental homes, to make them greener, healthier, and safer for low-income households, seniors, and persons with disabilities. The projects span the range from targeted upgrades to major net-zero renovation for properties in 36 states and the District of Columbia As of May 21, 2024, HUD has awarded more than $610 million in grants and surplus cash loans under the GRRP; $255.5 million in grants and $355.8 million in surplus cash loans. Of the awardees receiving grants and loans in seven rounds of funding, 99 are properties receiving Multifamily Section 8 project-based rental assistance, 21 properties are receiving Section 202 project-based rental assistance for low-income seniors, and one is receiving Section 811 project-based rental assistance for low-income persons with disabilities.

"Friday, May 24, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_127,HUD Makes $26 Million Available to Promote Fair Housing and Root Out Discrimination,"WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is awarding $26 million in non-competitive funding available to HUD’s state and local fair housing enforcement agencies across the country under its Fair Housing Assistance Program (FHAP). The FHAP is an intergovernmental partnership between the federal government and state and local agencies to provide protection to the public against discrimination in housing. The funding to State and local enforcement agencies supports fair housing complaint investigations and education and outreach activities to inform the public, housing providers, and local governments about their rights and responsibilities under both the Fair Housing Act and state and local fair housing laws. “One of HUD’s most important priorities is to ensure that we root out any and all forms of discrimination in housing, but we cannot do this work without our partners on the ground,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “Today, we’re making $26 million more available to enforce the Fair Housing Act and ensure fair housing for all.” The $26 million in fiscal year 2024 funding supports the efforts of 77 State, county, and city agencies that administer fair housing laws that provide rights, remedies, and procedures that are substantially equivalent to those provided by the federal Fair Housing Act. This past year, HUD saw a 6% increase in the total number of cases processed by FHAP agencies. “HUD’s FHAP partner agencies play a pivotal role in our enforcement efforts to minimize discrimination and inequalities that exist in today’s housing market,” said Demetria L. McCain, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. “Discriminatory actions based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex (including sexual orientation and gender identity), disability and familial status are illegal and our partnerships with state and local agencies are essential in the fight for fair housing.” ""These vital funds provide essential support to state and local jurisdictions dedicated to the effective enforcement of fair housing laws in collaboration with HUD,"" said Dr. Alisa Warren, President of the International Association of Official Human Rights Agencies, which comprises FHAP agencies. ""FHAP agencies are actively engaged in human rights implementation within communities to safeguard individuals against discrimination and by leveraging the law in their jurisdiction."" “Fair Housing Assistance Program (FHAP) agencies are an important part of the fair housing ecosystem. These groups enforce state and local fair housing laws that provide critical protections for people trying to obtain secure, fair, and affordable housing opportunities,” said Lisa Rice, President and CEO, National Fair Housing Alliance. “Private fair housing non-profit organizations that work on the frontlines to investigate discrimination complaints need to have strong, well-funded FHAP agencies to ensure people can access the housing they need free from unfair practices.” To learn more about how a state or local jurisdiction can join the Fair Housing Assistance Program, visit the Department’s FHAP website. People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD’s Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 877-8339 (Relay). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to hud.gov/fairhousing. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Thursday, May 23, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_124,HUD and Census Bureau Report New Residential Sales in April 2024,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Census Bureau jointly announced the following new residential sales statistics for April 2024: New Home Sales Sales of new single‐family houses in April 2024 were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 634,000, according to estimates released jointly today by the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. This is 4.7 percent (±12.0 percent)* below the revised March rate of 665,00 and is 7.7 percent (±13.2 percent)* below the April 2023 estimate of 687,000. Sales Price The median sales price of new houses sold in April 2024 was $433,500. The average sales price was $505,700. For Sale Inventory and Months’ Supply The seasonally adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of April was 480,000. This represents a supply of 9.1 months at the current sales rate. The May report is scheduled for release on June 26, 2024. View the full schedule in the Economic Briefing Room. The full text and tables for this release can be found at census.gov/construction/nrs/. EXPLANATORY NOTES These statistics are estimated from sample surveys. They are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated average relative standard errors of the preliminary data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as “2.5 percent (±3.2%) above” appears in the text, this indicates the range (‐0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90‐percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. Changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show irregular movement. It takes 3 months to establish a trend for new houses sold. Preliminary new home sales figures are subject to revision due to the survey methodology and definitions used. The survey is primarily based on a sample of houses selected from building permits. Since a “sale” is defined as a deposit taken or sales agreement signed, this can occur prior to a permit being issued. An estimate of these prior sales is included in the sales figure. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimate of total sales is revised about 3.2 percent. Changes in sales price data reflect changes in the distribution of houses by region, size, etc., as well as changes in the prices of houses with identical characteristics. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found on our website. The Census Bureau has reviewed SOC monthly and quarterly tables to ensure appropriate access, use, and disclosure avoidance protection of the confidential source data (Disclosure Review Board (DRB) approval number: CBDRB‐FY23‐0307). * The 90 percent confidence interval includes zero. In such cases, there is insufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero."

"Tuesday, May 21, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_122,Biden-Harris Administration Announces Nearly $67 Million in New Funding to Make Homes More Energy Efficient and Climate Resilient,"Awards from President Biden’s Investing in America Agenda will combat the climate crisis, advance environmental justice, and improve lives for residents in HUD-supported housing. WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced nearly $67 million in new grant and loan awards for 12 properties under its Green and Resilient Retrofit Program (GRRP) as part of President Biden’s Investing in America agenda, bringing the total funding awarded under this program to more than $610 million. These grants and loans will support energy efficiency and climate resilience renovations to keep more than 14,000 homes at properties housing low-income individuals, families, and seniors safer and more comfortable, especially during extreme weather events. Assistant Secretary for Housing Julia R. Gordon and Deputy Assistant Secretary for Multifamily Housing Ethan Handelman announced the new grant and loan awards at an event at Washington Park apartments in Cincinnati, OH. The property, owned by Preservation of Affordable Housing, Inc., received a $2.2 million surplus cash loan award from HUD for energy efficiency and climate resilience upgrades for 37 homes that serve low-income individuals and families residing at Washington Park. “At HUD, we work to deliver on President Biden’s Investing in America agenda, investing millions more to ensure the families that we serve live in homes that are healthier,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “These investments will reduce costs and make homes healthier, cheaper to operate, and climate resilient.” “Today’s announcement underscores the keen appetite by owners of assisted housing to increase energy efficiency and climate resilience measures across the country and how the President’s Investing in America agenda helps meet that need,” said Assistant Secretary for Housing Julia Gordon. “So far, properties in 36 states and the District of Columbia are putting GRRP funding to work to finance critical upgrades benefitting residents, owners and communities.” “Far too many Americans struggle to stay warm in the winter and cool in the summer,” said John Podesta, Senior Advisor to the President for International Climate Policy. “Today’s awards from the Department of Housing and Urban Development will boost the quality of life for thousands of moderate- and low-income American families by making their homes safer and more comfortable.” All of the investments announced today will advance environmental justice in line with President Biden’s Justice40 Initiative, which sets a goal that 40 percent of the overall benefits of certain federal investments flow to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized by underinvestment and overburdened by pollution. Retrofitting these homes will reduce their carbon emissions, ;protecting homes during extreme weather events, and advancing the President’s housing supply and clean energy agenda, ensuring affordable housing stays affordable for residents and building owners across the nation. In fact, two-thirds of the awardees announced today are in communities designated as environmentally disadvantaged areas, as designated by the White House Council on Environmental Quality’s Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool. The grants and loans announced today are the third set of awards made under the GRRP’s Leading Edge category, which requires property owners to commit to achieving recognized, high performance green certifications, such as the National Green Building Standard Gold with Green+ Net Zero Designation. The certifications recognize significant property upgrades such as on-site solar, wind turbines, impact and wind-resistant roofing, and other substantial energy efficiency and climate resilience improvements. “The enhancements being made to properties using GRRP funding will make the homes of low-income families safer, more efficient, and healthier to live in.” said Deputy Assistant Secretary for Multifamily Housing Ethan Handelman. “We’re pleased to support these efforts to improve the nation’s affordable housing stock while also supporting efforts to combat climate change.” The 12 properties receiving Leading Edge awards today are all properties participating in the HUD Section 8 project-based rental assistance program for low-income individuals and families. Two properties have more than 200 units, seven properties have between 51-200 units, and three properties have 50 or fewer units. View the full list of grantees below. President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act—the largest climate investment in history—established the GRRP in 2022 to fund energy efficiency and resiliency improvements for HUD’s assisted rental portfolio. FACT SHEET: Green and Resilient Retrofit Program Progress to Date GRRP is the first HUD program to simultaneously invest in energy efficiency, renewable energy generation, climate resilience, and low-embodied-carbon materials in HUD-assisted multifamily housing to promote housing preservation and health. All of the investments under the GRRP will be made in affordable housing communities serving low-income families, directly benefiting HUD-assisted housing, in alignment with the Justice40 Initiative. Two-thirds of the awardees announced today are in communities designated as environmentally disadvantaged areas, as designated by the White House Council on Environmental Quality’s Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool. As of May 21, 2024, GRRP funding has been awarded to 122 properties and more than 14,000 rental homes, to make them greener, healthier, and safer for low-income households, seniors, and persons with disabilities. The projects span the range from targeted upgrades to major net-zero renovation for properties in 36 states and the District of Columbia. As of May 21, 2024, HUD has awarded more than $610 million in grants and surplus cash loans under the GRRP; $255.5 million in grants and $355.8 million in surplus cash loans.

"Friday, May 17, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_118,HUD Negotiates Agreement With North Carolina Office of Recovery and Resiliency to Remove Barriers to Disaster Recovery Funds,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has entered into a Conciliation Agreement and Voluntary Compliance Agreement (Agreement) with the North Carolina Office of Recovery and Resiliency (NCORR) resolving an allegation that NCORR discriminated in its disaster recovery programs because of race. A North Carolina resident who filed a complaint in the case and was represented by North Carolina Legal Aid is also a party to the agreement. Read the Agreement. “Subjecting Black storm survivors to barriers that ultimately prevent them from rebuilding their homes is unconscionable,” said Demetria L. McCain, HUD’s Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. “HUD is committed to making sure that disaster recovery funds are administered justly.” The Agreement resolves the complaint filed against NCORR under the Fair Housing Act, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and Section 109 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974. The complaint alleged that NCORR’s heirs’ property policy unlawfully discriminated against Black homeowners and prevented them from accessing disaster recovery funds to repair their homes. “Heirs’ property” is family land inherited without a will or traditional documentation of ownership. Black, Latino, and Indigenous households, as well as low-income people and members of other marginalized groups, are disproportionately heirs’ property owners. NCORR’s heirs’ property policy included proof of ownership criteria that required applicants for disaster relief funds to first consult with anyone with a property ownership claim. Additionally, it required that the owner signing the grant agreement have authority to act on behalf of any occupants of the property as well as anyone who may claim an interest in the destroyed property. The complaint alleged that these requirements denied equal housing opportunities and disparately impacted Black homeowners from seeking disaster recovery assistance funds. In addition to securing relief for the individual complainant, the Agreement requires NCORR to remove existing discriminatory barriers faced by homeowner storm survivors seeking recovery assistance and to comply with fair housing laws in the future. Under the Agreement, NCORR will finalize revisions to its ReBuild NC Homeowner Recovery Program (Program). The revisions will address any discriminatory impact the existing policy had on Black homeowners whose primary residences were directly or indirectly impacted by Hurricanes Matthew and/or Florence. The revisions will allow applicants for disaster recovery funds to submit a signed affidavit as proof of property ownership. The Agreement requires NCORR to provide notice of the policy changes to applicants rejected or otherwise barred from participation in the Program and an opportunity to appeal for reentry into the Program, which will expand access to disaster recovery funds to North Carolina residents. HUD did not issue a letter of findings prior to entering into the Agreement and the Agreement does not constitute admissions by NCORR or evidence of a final determination by HUD of violations of Title VI, Title VIII, Section 109, or any other laws based on the allegations of the complaint. People who believe they are the victims of housing discrimination should contact HUD at (800) 9669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY).

At the event, Vice President Harris discussed investing in communities, building wealth, and ensuring every American has the ability to thrive. During a moderated conversation with comedian, radio host, and author DL Hughley, the Vice President highlighted how the Biden-Harris Administration has taken historic steps to advance economic opportunity by improving access to housing. They were also joined by Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo, Wisconsin Lieutenant Governor Sara Rodriguez, Wisconsin Secretary of State Sarah Godlewski, Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley, Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson, and the offices of U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin and U.S. Representative Gwen Moore. The funding announced today will go to more than 165 housing counseling agencies to help expand housing counseling services across the country. These funds can be used to help homebuyers improve their credit, develop a budget, find down payment assistance programs, understand loan terms and types of mortgages, and identify housing discrimination. Counselors can also help renters search for housing and navigate the application process. HUD estimates that over $300,000 of this new funding will go to help consumers in Wisconsin. The Biden-Harris Administration and HUD have already helped nearly 35,000 Americans through this program in Wisconsin – 19,000 of whom live in Milwaukee. These counseling services are currently serving nearly 12,000 families in Wisconsin, 40 percent of whom are Black families. At the event, three local housing counseling agencies attended: Acts Housing, Housing Resources Inc, and United Community Center. HUD supports a strong national network of 1,480 HUD-approved housing counseling agencies and over 4,300 HUD-certified housing counselors. In 2023 alone, HUD-approved housing counseling agencies served nearly one million individuals and families. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Thursday, May 16, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_116,HUD Officials Visit Portland as Part of National “Road to Innovation” Tour,"PORTLAND - Last week, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary (PDAS) for Policy Development and Research Solomon Greene and Northwest Regional Administrator Andrew Lofton toured innovative affordable housing developments as part of HUD's national ""Road to Innovation” Tour leading up to the 2024 Innovative Housing Showcase in Washington, DC next month. Before visiting Portland, PDAS Greene visited Detroit and Minneapolis and Seattle. “The varied projects we toured in the Portland area, from the nation’s largest Passive House certified multifamily development at Orchards at Orenco to the largest restorative redevelopment project that centers Portland’s Black residents and their history at Albina Vision Trust, demonstrate that Oregon’s housing sector shares in HUD’s belief that new and innovative approaches are needed to solve the housing crisis,” said Solomon Greene, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research. “In meeting with Oregon’s housing leaders, I recognized another shared belief: that innovative approaches can and should center low-income and marginalized residents. It is evident across the state that practitioners are centering marginalized communities in their plans to maximize the impact and longevity of new state policies and funding opportunities.” ""Affordable housing developers are leading the charge in sustainability across Oregon and the Portland region, utilizing cutting-edge technology to build homes that are both affordable and eco-friendly,” said HUD Northwest Regional Administrator Andrew Lofton. “It’s clear that partnerships are essential, and the collaborative efforts in Oregon are a prime example of how we can tackle the housing crisis together.” The “Road to Innovation” tours will culminate in Washington, DC with HUD’s 2024 Innovative Housing Showcase slated for June 7th through 9th on the National Mall. The showcase is a public event during which leading homebuilders, technologists, and designers will show their cutting-edge approaches to increase housing supply, lower construction costs, increase energy efficiency, and reduce housing expenses. The first stop on the tour was to Orchards at Orenco, located in Hillsboro, Oregon, and owned by REACH. Orchards at Orenco is a model of innovation and sustainable design in affordable housing and was named the largest multi‐family Passive House certified building in North America upon construction completion in 2015. The building has a meticulously sealed building shell, resulting in a 90% reduction in heating energy use compared to traditional construction. Some of the innovative features include triple‐paned windows, a heat‐recovery system, and a super‐insulated extremely airtight building envelope. There is also an energy monitoring system located in the lobby, designed to track and help improve tenants’ energy‐use habits. This approach not only benefits the environment but also significantly reduces utility costs for residents. There are 8 HUD vouchers in the project dedicated to assisting households earning 30% or less of the Median Family Income. ""Orchards at Orenco is more than just a building; it's a vibrant community that embodies our commitment to pioneering solutions in affordable housing,"" said Margaret Salazar, CEO of REACH Community Development. ""We're proud to integrate Passive House standards in a way that profoundly impacts the lives of our residents and sets the stage for future developments. With HUD's support through project‐based vouchers, we're making a definitive statement that affordability does not have to compromise quality or environmental responsibility.” Next, the group held a discussion on Cost-Efficient Design and Construction (CEDC) principles which include construction design, assembly, and materials innovation with Walsh Construction Co. and Northwest Housing Alternatives. Walsh has experimented proactively with innovative technologies and methods – including modular construction, mass timber, light gauge steel, insulated concrete forms and structural insulated panels – in a concerted effort to see if these alternatives can produce fundamental improvements in either the cost, speed, or quality of affordable multi-family housing construction. The group engaged in discussion on Oregon state and local policy innovations including a focus on community land trusts and construction in rural areas. Created to help alleviate Oregon’s current housing crisis, the Housing Innovation Partnership consists of innovative leaders from the private, public, and civic sectors who are dedicated to finding new ways to increase housing production. The last stop of the tour was to the historic Albina neighborhood to meet with the Albina Vision Trust (AVT), a local nonprofit developer that is spearheading the largest restorative redevelopment in the United States. AVT's 94-acre, community-led development vision has brought over a half billion dollars of investment to Lower Albina in the past 3 years. Albina One, the nonprofit's first development, will be welcoming families in the summer of 2025. Albina One is a 94-unit, family-focused project in an area of inner N/NE Portland that once was home to over 80% of the city's Black population. These units are designed to counter the intentional displacement of Black people from the neighborhood due to urban renewal, freeway siting, and long-term gentrification. The mix of one, two and three-bedroom units will serve young Portlanders, notably those that work in the trades. AVT is also partnering with the Oregon Department of Transportation to build a developable highway cover over Interstate 5, the highway that bisected Portland's Black community in the 1960s and 70s, as well as moving to acquire the 10.5-acre Portland Public Schools administrative headquarters campus, which will be torn down and redeveloped into over 1,000 units of housing for displaced Portlanders right along the banks of the Willamette River. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

WASHINGTON - Today, Vice President Kamala Harris and HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman announced that the Biden-Harris Administration is awarding nearly $40 million to expand comprehensive housing counseling services for homebuyers, homeowners, and renters throughout America. These awards – through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) Office of Housing Counseling – will fund counseling services that equip individuals and families with vital education and resources to inform decisions about their housing needs and opportunities. The Vice President and Acting Secretary will highlight this new funding while in Milwaukee, WI today for the third stop on the Vice President’s nationwide Economic Opportunity Tour. “Homeownership represents more than just a roof over our heads; it represents financial security, the opportunity to build wealth and equity, and a foundation for a better future for ourselves, our children, and future generations,” said Vice President Harris. “That is why President Biden and I are continuing to address barriers to housing by announcing $40 million to expand housing counseling services in communities across the country. This new funding to more than 165 housing counseling agencies will build economic opportunity while helping homebuyers throughout America improve their credit, find down payment assistance programs, understand loan terms and types of mortgages, navigate the application process, and identify housing discrimination.” “This past year, HUD-approved housing counseling agencies reached almost one million Americans, providing them with invaluable advice on important topics like financial literacy, maintaining a home, and avoiding foreclosure,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “Today, we are providing $40 million more to expand these services – specifically for underserved communities – so we can build the next generation of homeowners and close the racial homeownership gap.” HUD plans to award grants to more than 165 housing counseling agencies and intermediary organizations. Fourteen grantees will also partner with 60 Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Serving Institutions to support new homeowners of color and other marginalized communities. Funds can be used for counseling services covering various topics, including financial management and literacy, homeownership, and affordable rental housing. For example, one of the grantees – Unidos US – aims to creating pathways for Latino homebuyers to build credit, afford a down payment, and get approved for a sustainable mortgage loan. While in Milwaukee, WI today, Vice President Harris and Acting Secretary Todman will speak to the importance of these funds and the Biden-Harris Administration’s broader work to cut housing costs for American consumers. HUD estimates that over $300,000 of this new funding will go to help consumers in Wisconsin. The Biden-Harris Administration and HUD have already helped nearly 35,000 Americans through this program in Wisconsin – 19,000 of whom live in Milwaukee. These counseling services are currently serving nearly 12,000 families in Wisconsin, 40 percent of whom are Black families. At the event, three housing counseling agencies will be present: Acts Housing, Housing Resources Inc, and United Community Center. “We’re proud to make these funds available to HUD-certified housing counselors, who are often the first point of contact for those seeking support with their housing needs,” said Deputy Assistant Secretary for Housing Counseling David Berenbaum. “Given the rising costs of housing, coupled with limited available inventory, housing counseling is a critical resource for homebuyers and renters seeking to navigate challenging processes and decisions.” The list of grant recipients and awards are available here. Fact Sheet: HUD and the Biden-Harris Administration Provides Housing Counseling to Millions of Americans Since 2020, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has helped over 3 million individuals and families to obtain, sustain, and retain their homes. Quick Facts HUD supports a strong national network of 1,480 HUD-approved housing counseling agencies and over 4,300 HUD-certified housing counselors. In 2023 alone, HUD-approved housing counseling agencies served nearly one million individuals and families. Since 2020, HUD has awarded over $140 million in grants to support this work. In 2022 and 2023, OHC awarded over $6.3 million to housing counseling organizations that provided professional development and training opportunities to new and existing HUD-certified housing counselors to equip them with the necessary tools to meet the evolving needs of homeowners, homebuyers, and renters. Nearly 1,500 classes were offered, over 35,000 counselors were trained, and just over 25,000 scholarships were provided to counselors as a result of these grant awards. During the pandemic, HUD-approved Housing Counseling Agencies helped over 250,000 Americans to sustain their housing through applications to the Treasury Emergency Rental Assistance Program (ERAP) and Homeowner Assistance Fund (HAF) programs. How does Housing Counseling Help? HUD-approved housing counseling agencies provide services to address a full range of housing needs including: Budgeting and financial education; Education and one-on-one counseling to renters, homebuyers and homeowners; Helping unhoused individuals transition to affordable housing; Education on emergency preparedness and assisting families with disaster recovery; and Helping seniors determine whether a Home Equity Conversion Mortgage or other reverse mortgage makes sense for them. Budgeting and financial education; Education and one-on-one counseling to renters, homebuyers and homeowners; Helping unhoused individuals transition to affordable housing; Education on emergency preparedness and assisting families with disaster recovery; and Helping seniors determine whether a Home Equity Conversion Mortgage or other reverse mortgage makes sense for them. Working with Minority-Serving Institutions and Historically Black Colleges and Universities In 2021, HUD’s Office of Housing Counseling (OHC) launched the Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) Initiative. Since then, HUD has awarded $9 million to facilitate partnerships between HUD-approved Housing Counseling Agencies and HBCUs and MSIs to provide homebuyer education and housing counseling for students, faculty, administration at participating HBCUs and MSIs as well as community residents. Through this national initiative 14 HUD approved national housing counseling intermediary organizations have formed 60 partnerships with 51 MSIs in 18 states and territories. The overarching goals of this effort are to empower the next generation of homeowners and train the next generation of housing counselors. Let’s Make Home the Goal, a Nationwide Awareness Campaign In 2023, HUD launched “Let’s Make Home the Goal”, a nationwide, multi-year campaign to generate awareness of the availability and benefits of pre-purchase housing counseling provided by HUD-certified housing counselors. The campaign is designed to reach communities of color that have historically faced more difficulties with the homebuying process due to systemic barriers. Through digital advertising, events, and public service announcements, “Let’s Make Home the Goal” reached over 5 million prospective homebuyers in 15 targeted metro areas in states with a concentration of diverse communities and more affordable housing markets. In 2024, Let’s Make Home the Goal is expanding to over 40 metro areas – HUD is expecting to reach over 8 million consumers in this year. Homeownership Initiative Grant Program In March 2024, HUD’s Office of Housing Counseling launched a new $10 million Homeownership Initiative grant program to fund eligible HUD-approved housing counseling agencies (HCAs) to help prepare and equip prospective homebuyers to successfully navigate the homebuying process. The funding affirms the ongoing commitment of the Biden-Harris Administration to help close the racial wealth gap and address homebuying barriers that disproportionately affect marginalized communities. This new funding will enable HUD-approved housing counseling agencies to provide culturally sensitive and linguistically appropriate services for pre- and post-purchase housing counseling, aiming to increase homeownership rates among historically underserved communities. This initiative will fund consumer housing counseling sessions that result in homeownership through a new negotiated fixed-fee with counseling agencies. HUD expects this approach to establish a “market rate” for pre-purchase counseling services that will significantly expand private sector support for homeownership counseling. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Wednesday, May 15, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_114,"HUD Modernizes Country's Largest Affordable Housing Grant Program, Making Housing More Accessible for Families Nationwide","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) published a preview of a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to modernize regulations for the HOME Investment Partnership Program (HOME), with publication in the Federal Register to follow later this month. The proposed rule would streamline program requirements for states and localities, better align HOME funding with other federal housing resources, reduce administrative burden for communities and housing developers, improve assistance and protections for renters, strengthen the use of HOME for homeownership activities, and encourage green and climate resilient building practices. The HOME program is a critical tool to bolster housing supply and preserve existing affordable housing at a time of dire need. Through HOME funding, HUD advances the Biden Administration’s goal of building 2 million units of housing. The Biden-Harris Administration’s Housing Supply Action Plan committed to modernizing and streamlining the HOME program. HOME is the largest Federal block grant to state and local governments for the creation of affordable housing for low-income households. Under the HOME program, states, localities, and territories receive flexible block grants to provide down payment assistance and closing costs; build new housing to own or rent; rehabilitate existing housing; and on a limited basis, provide tenant based rental assistance. HUD recently announced $1.3 billion for fiscal year 2024 to over 650 participating jurisdictions. This notice of proposed rulemaking is the first significant update to the regulations governing the HOME program in over a decade. “For more than 30 years, the HOME program has been used to build affordable housing for homeowners and renters and to provide rental assistance that has played a critical role in advancing housing opportunities for low-income families across the country,” said Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “The proposed rule is a significant step in improving the HOME program, reducing redundant administrative requirements, and expanding access to affordable housing nationwide.” These updates would improve the ability of participating jurisdictions who receive HOME to implement funding more effectively and efficiently – making it easier for States and localities to use HOME to support low-income renters, homeowners, and homebuyers. Additionally, if finalized , the proposed rule would simplify requirements for homeownership activities. The update addresses common challenges in homebuyer activities by extending sales deadlines for HOME-assisted units, adding flexibility for resale provisions, and allowing for rehabilitation of HOME-assisted properties after acquisition. The proposed rule also advances the Biden-Harris Administration’s efforts to strengthen renter protections, including through its Blueprint for a Renters Bill of Rights and acceptable industry standards. The proposed changes to HOME tenant-based rental assistance would support low-income renters by creating a mandatory lease addendum with enhanced tenant protections, better define ‘good cause’ in the HOME program and reduce burdensome paperwork for tenants. Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development Marion McFadden added: “For years, stakeholders, elected officials, and grantees have asked ‘How can we make HOME funding easier to use?’ We meticulously evaluated how we could modernize and improve the program. This proposed rule would strengthen the program – benefiting families of modest means, small property owners, nonprofit organizations, and communities for years to come.” The update would also expand opportunities for nonprofit organizations and developers who use HOME funding to create and retain renter or homeowner activities in their neighborhoods, such as revised requirements for community housing development organizations and community land trusts. Further supporting housing investments, the proposed rule also simplifies requirements for small-scale rental housing projects and better aligns HOME with Low Income Housing Tax Credits. It would also provide incentives for green building and energy efficiency standards, which could result in lower utility and insurance costs for homeowners. If finalized, this proposed rule would reduce administrative burden by aligning utility allowances with other HUD programs, aligning inspection requirements with NSPIRE, reducing the frequency of income determination certification, and eliminating arduous waiting list requirements for small properties. HUD seeks public comment on this proposed rule and invites all interested parties and members of the public to submit their views, comments, and recommendations for improvement for this proposal. Comments may be submitted electronically through www.regulations.gov, or through the methods described in the proposed rule. HOME is a formula grant program which provides funding to all fifty states and over 650 localities – exclusively benefiting low-income households. Further information regarding HOME, click here. For the full proposed rule text find HUD's preview of the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on the HOME Investment Partnership Program here. The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking will soon be published in the Federal Register. Comments will be due no later than 60 days after publication. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Wednesday, May 15, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_113,Biden-Harris Administration Announces $1.1 Billion for Tribal Housing and Community Development,"WASHINGTON - Today, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman welcomed the Tribal Intergovernmental Advisory Committee at HUD Headquarters where she announced awarding a record $1.1 billion in funding for the Indian Housing Block Grant (IHBG) program and a $75 million funding opportunity for the Indian Community Development Block (ICDBG) program to support housing and community development projects. “By prioritizing funding and support for housing in Tribal communities, HUD is living up to its mission of ensuring that everyone in this country has access to affordable housing options,” said Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “As we commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Indian Community Development Block Grant program, we are investing in the continued health of Tribal communities across our country. Today’s announcement emphasizes the Biden-Harris Administration’s dedication to strengthening the Nation-to-Nation relationship with Tribes and making key investments in Indian Country.” The IHBG program is the primary means by which the Federal Government fulfills its trust responsibilities to provide adequate housing to Native Americans and is the single largest source of Indian housing assistance. The $1.1 billion in funding represents a 40-percent increase from last year and marks the largest ever funding investment in Indian housing. Funding can be used for affordable housing activities including new housing construction, rehabilitation, and housing services, and more. The $75 million that will be awarded through the ICDBG program will provide eligible grantees with assistance in developing viable American Indian and Alaska Native communities. Projects in Indian Country tend to focus on affordable housing rehabilitation, and construction of community buildings and infrastructure. At the onset of this Administration, we witnessed unprecedented housing challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, rising rents, historically high interest rates, affordable housing shortages, and the cumulative effects of a deep history of housing discrimination. Millions of Americans were behind on their rents and mortgages and HUD stood in the gap. Issues facing the American people at the start of 2021 burdened families of all income levels, with a particular impact on low- and moderate-income families. This was particularly true for Tribal communities. Since that time, the Biden-Harris Administration has taken great strides to affect positive change in Tribal housing, including: HUD Provided Historic Investments in Tribal Communities In FY 2024, HUD has awarded more than $1 billion in funding for housing in Tribal communities through the following three major programs: the Indian Housing Block Grant (IHBG) program the IHBG Competitive program the Indian Community Development Block Grant program the Indian Housing Block Grant (IHBG) program the IHBG Competitive program the Indian Community Development Block Grant program In FY 2023 alone, Tribes and Tribally Designated Housing Entities acquired almost 1,000 new housing units through the IHBG and IHBG Competitive programs. HUD Made Homeownership More Accessible and Affordable for Native American Families HUD reduced fees charged to homebuyers with Section 184 Indian Home loan – a move that allowed more people to qualify for a mortgage and can save the average Native American family almost $6,800 over the term of their loan. Additionally, new regulations were published to improve and modernize the Section 184 program this spring. HUD Honors Trust Responsibilities and Promotes Self-Determination On December 6, 2023, President Biden issued an Executive Order to reform Federal processes for Tribal Nations and better support Tribes in embracing trust responsibilities and promoting the next era of Tribal self-determination. The Executive Order directs all Federal agencies to assess historical underfunding of Tribal programs by reviewing and evaluating programs and funding sources where Tribes are eligible and take action to increase access and reduce administrative burden for Tribes. HUD has already taken steps to implement the Executive Order by establishing funding set-asides for Tribes in various competitive programs and will continue to take action to further the purposes of the Executive Order across HUD programs. HUD Worked to Strengthen Nation-to-Nation Relationships On January 26, 2021, President Biden issued a Presidential Memorandum on Tribal Consultation and Strengthening Nation-to-Nation Relationships. The Memorandum affirms the Administration’s commitment to Tribal sovereignty and to fulfilling Federal trust and treaty responsibilities to Tribal Nations and calls for Federal agencies to take action. HUD quickly responded by developing a Tribal Consultation Plan of Actions and expanding its Tribal consultation efforts throughout the Department. In response to President Biden’s Memorandum on Tribal Consultation and Strengthening Nation-to-Nation Relationships, HUD established its first Tribal Intergovernmental Advisory Committee (TIAC). The TIAC brings together senior HUD leadership and Tribal Leaders to ensure the needs of Tribes are being met in how HUD programs are designed and implemented. HUD provided relief to Tribal communities during the COVID-19 Pandemic The Biden-Harris Administration responded with the American Rescue Plan, which provided $750 million in HUD resources to Indian Country. HUD works to serve Native Veterans every day The Biden-Harris Administration has provided continued support for Native veterans through the Tribal HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (Tribal HUD-VASH) program, which links housing with other vital services for veterans. More than 440 Native veterans are currently being served through the Tribal HUD-VASH program. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Tuesday, May 14, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_112,HUD Announces $30 Billion Investment to Keep American Families Housed,"WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced $30 billion in renewal funding for the Housing Choice Voucher Program (HCV). This funding will help Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) continue to provide assistance to families and individuals who are in need of affordable housing options. “These housing choice vouchers will create stability and certainty for individuals and families throughout the country,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “As HUD’s single largest investment in affordable housing, these funds make accessing affordable housing less burdensome for renters, public housing authorities, and landlords. Since last year, the HCV program saw a $2 billion increase in funding to help maintain housing vouchers for families across the country. Since 2022, this budget allocation has grown nearly 20% (over $4 billion), allowing the value of a Housing Choice Voucher to keep pace with rising rental costs, and helping to make sure that voucher holders can continue to access neighborhoods of opportunity. This announcement is a continuation of the Biden-Harris Administration’s efforts to increase the housing supply across the country for those who are most in need. “The HCV program is the most successful rental program ever conceived,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, Richard J. Monocchio. “Not only do housing vouchers free up income for basic needs, but when families are able to live in stable, affordable housing in low-poverty communities, we see higher cognitive test scores and educational outcomes for children and increased chances of attending college and earning more as adults.” Housing Vouchers assist over 2.3 million families in need of housing, including families with children, older adults, veterans, and people with disabilities, making it the most effective intervention to reduce homelessness and housing instability. Housing Vouchers offer families flexibility and a wider range of affordable housing options in communities with better schools, or access to jobs or other opportunities, but landlords must be willing to accept vouchers for them to be effective. HUD continues to work with communities to help them promote the housing choice voucher program by offering tools for landlord engagement and working with PHAs to meet their local housing needs with the HCV utilization resources.

Rocket Mortgage denied the loan application. As a result, complainants allege they were forced to pay a higher interest rate and accept a loan from another lender on less-favorable terms. The agreement resolves the complaint with Rocket Mortgage. “No one seeking to purchase a home should be subjected to unlawful discrimination when applying for a home mortgage,” said Demetria L. McCain, HUD’s Principal Deputy Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. “This agreement demonstrates HUD’s commitment to ensuring fair lending for homeowners and home purchasers living on Tribal lands.” The agreement secures $65,000 compensation to complainants, requires Rocket Mortgage to provide fair lending training to its employees, and requires Rocket Mortgage to abide by fair lending requirements for applicants seeking residential mortgage credit located within the boundaries of a Native American reservation. Additionally, Rocket Mortgage will invest at least $30,000 to provide financial support for programs that improve housing conditions, consumer financial literacy and education, outreach and homeownership education or counseling for Native Americans. Rocket Mortgage also agreed to conduct outreach through its website and social media platforms describing the company’s broad range of financing options available to eligible applicants whose loans are secured by property located within the boundaries of Native American reservations. People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 877-8339 (Relay). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed at hud.gov/fairhousing. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Monday, May 13, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_110,HUD is Expanding Solutions to Tackle Homelessness with Housing Vouchers,"WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced a new opportunity for communities to expedite housing assistance for people experiencing homelessness in the Housing Choice Voucher program. Housing agencies can now request to accept self-certification of income to determine program eligibility for people experiencing homelessness. This can help shorten the amount of time it takes to move into healthy, stable homes. “Broadening the Biden-Harris Administration’s efforts to keep American’s housed, HUD is doing all we can to support communities’ actions to end homelessness and transition into affordable homes.” Said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “Today’s announcement of flexibilities helps to make federal rental assistance more accessible and more quickly available to the individuals and families that need it the most.” People experiencing homelessness often may not have the necessary documents readily available that are typically required to establish their eligibility for voucher assistance such as social security cards or pay stubs. Because missing documents can significantly delay assistance and timely access to housing, these Housing Choice Voucher waivers will allow housing agencies to accept self-certification of income, disability status, and other specific information to expedite assistance to people experiencing homelessness. Agencies must then verify tenants’ eligibility within 90 days after they begin receiving assistance. Housing Choice Vouchers help low-income families, the elderly, and persons with disabilities accessibility to decent and safe rental housing in the private market, and are an important part of federal, state, and local strategies to reduce homelessness. The waivers that HUD has approved are available to communities experiencing significant or rising rates of homelessness. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Wednesday, May 8, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_105,"HUD Invests $750,000 to Boost Energy Efficiency and Climate Resilience for Low-Income Senior Housing in Tennessee","LEXINGTON, TN - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) Office of Multifamily Housing Programs, announced it has completed a $750,000 grant transaction under the Green and Resilient Retrofit Program (GRRP) with Wesley Living of Tennessee. The transaction will be used to finance energy efficiency and climate resilient renovations of the Woodland Homes apartment community in Lexington, Tennessee. This represents the incorporation of a GRRP award into a construction project to increase the energy efficiency and climate resilience of the property. “Supporting sustainable and affordable homes for all is at the core of our mission,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “The completion of this transaction under GRRP in support of a low-income senior housing community in rural Tennessee is just one example of our investments into climate resilience for communities across the country.” Woodland Homes is a 61-unit, 15-building apartment community serving very low-income seniors. HUD provides project-based rental assistance to 60 of the households at the property. Originally constructed in 1920 and last renovated in 2011, the property is undergoing a $5.09 million dollar rehabilitation to upgrade the electrical system at the property, replace roofs, and perform additional building envelope improvements. Wesley Living will use HUD's GRRP funding to supplement transformer upgrades for electrification work, and to replace the existing gas fired furnace with split HVAC systems. “We are pleased to complete this Green and Resilient Retrofit Program funding transaction with Wesley Living to help upgrade the property, reduce carbon emissions, and make residents’ homes safer and more energy efficient,” said Deputy Assistant Secretary for Multifamily Housing Programs Ethan Handelman. “Funding this work in Tennessee and similar properties throughout the country to improve the lives of residents is exactly what the program was designed to do.” About GRRP Funded under the Inflation Reduction Act, GRRP provides funding for direct loans and grants to make improvements to HUD-subsidized properties serving very low-income families, seniors, and persons with disabilities. Properties were selected through three distinct funding opportunities designed to meet the diverse needs of properties across the country. Funding can be used to improve energy or water efficiency, enhance indoor air quality, install zero-emission electricity generation and energy storage equipment, acquire low-emission building materials, implement building electrification strategies, or address and improve climate resilience. The program seeks to amplify recent technological advancements in energy and water efficiency and to bring a new focus on preparing for climate hazards by reducing residents’ and properties’ exposure to hazards and by protecting life, livability, and property when disaster strikes. HUD has offered funding through three GRRP award types targeting HUD-subsidized affordable housing: Elements awards provide modest funding for property owners to incorporate proven and impactful climate resilience and carbon reduction measures to the construction scopes of an in-progress recapitalization transactions. Property owners use the funds to add green or resilient elements to existing scopes of property rehabilitation. Leading Edge awards provide funding for property owners to meet ambitious carbon reduction, renewable energy generation, and resilience goals without requiring extensive technical assistance from HUD. Comprehensive awards provide funding for properties with the highest need for climate resilience and energy efficiency upgrades to undertake a deep retrofit, focused on innovative energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions reductions, green and healthy housing measures, renewable energy generation, and climate resilience investments. Comprehensive Awards are designed for the widest range of properties and are accompanied by direct support from HUD to achieve the retrofit. FACT SHEET: Green and Resilient Retrofit Program Progress to Date GRRP is the first HUD program to simultaneously invest in energy efficiency, renewable energy generation, climate resilience, and low-embodied-carbon materials in HUD-assisted multifamily housing. As of March 28, 2024, HUD has awarded $544.4 million in GRRP funding to improve 109 properties in 38 states and the District of Columbia. These GRRP investments will improve over 12,600 rental homes. GRRP projects range from targeted upgrades supplementing in-progress recapitalization efforts to major net-zero renovations. More than 700 properties have also signed up for HUD’s free energy and water consumption benchmarking service, also funded through the Inflation Reduction Act. With benchmarking, HUD-assisted housing property owners can better understand the energy and water consumption at their properties to assess potential upgrades. In addition to ensuring that participating properties undergo deep retrofit work to increase their efficiency, make them greener and more resilient to climate hazards, it will also serve to preserve these units as affordable housing long-term.

"Tuesday, May 7, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_104,HUD Revitalizes Housing Voucher Program,"This Rule increases efficiency and creates opportunities for housing providers to preserve and grow the supply of affordable housing. WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced the publication of a new rule implementing portions of the Housing Opportunity Through Modernization Act of 2016 (HOTMA). Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing Richard J. Monocchio made the announcement in DeKalb County, Georgia. “HUD is meeting the moment to address the Nation’s affordable housing supply shortage. This Final Rule comprehensively modernizes our voucher programs to meet the needs of housing providers and deliver greater support for tenants,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “This effort represents collaboration between HUD and our stakeholders to build more affordable housing and make existing housing more affordable.” The Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) and Project Based Voucher (PBV) programs help communities preserve and expand the supply of affordable housing for low-income families and streamline and accelerate processes to reduce the regulatory burdens on Public Housing Agencies (PHAs). These programs supply PHAs with the necessary tools to support activities that both preserve and expand the supply of affordable housing. “These policy reforms help preserve and expand housing supply in our communities by making development actions easier and more flexible for housing agencies,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, Richard J. Monocchio. “It also lays the groundwork for long-term improvements in our most vital programs, which ultimately benefit residents and the broader community.” The HOTMA Final Rule makes important enhancements and reduces barriers in the HCV and PBV Program, which has become a vital strategy for communities to increase the supply of affordable housing. PHAs can choose to tie long term federal PBV rental assistance to specific units or developments rather than to a tenant. Project owners can secure additional private and public financing by leveraging the PBV assistance. The rule aligns with and supports emerging National and local strategies to rapidly increase affordable housing supply while ensuring families are able to successfully lease a decent, safe and sanitary unit with tenant based or project-based voucher assistance. Among other significant updates, these new policies: Allow for PBV assistance to be paired with manufactured housing Establish local project-specific waiting lists to help families move into units more quickly Codify important tenant protections for families in the areas of inspections and property and contract dispositions Ensure families are able to find units in the local rental markets by providing PHAs additional flexibilities to increase rents. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

These annual formula grants provide critical funding for a wide range of activities to address their most pressing local needs, providing flexible resources to build homes, support renters and homeowners, provide life-saving assistance to people experiencing homelessness, create jobs, and improve public facilities, community resilience, and local economies. The White House announced these funds this morning, and HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman will highlight the announcement at a press conference in Reno, Nevada today. “Homeownership is an essential part of the American Dream that represents so much more than a roof over our heads. For people all across our nation, a home represents financial security, the opportunity to build wealth and equity, and a foundation for a better future for themselves, their children, and future generations,” said Vice President Kamala Harris. “That is why President Biden and I are expanding on our historic investments in housing by announcing $5.5 billion that will increase access to affordable housing, invest in economic growth, and address homelessness in communities throughout America. This funding will build more affordable homes and support renters and homeowners while also lowering costs, building wealth, and creating jobs.” “A coordinated whole-of-community approach is crucial to build strong and resilient communities, invest in decent housing, create healthy environments, expand economic opportunities accessible to low-income households, and support aspiring homebuyers and those experiencing homelessness,” said Acting HUD Secretary Adrianne Todman. “The funding made available today serves as building blocks to empower communities to take ownership of community development investments and put the needs of residents first.” “For 50 years HUD has provided flexible grant funding so that communities nationwide can make their own choices about addressing their most urgent challenges. These funds will be used to create permanent housing, offer temporary shelter, provide downpayment assistance for ready homebuyers, support community infrastructure - like water and sewer projects - and invest in small businesses,” said Marion McFadden, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development. The next step is for communities to seek public feedback on their proposed use of the funds. Find your local grantee on our HUD Exchange website here. The grants announced today are provided through the following HUD programs: $3.3 billion to 1,254 grantees to build stronger communities - The Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) provide annual grants on a formula basis to States, cities, counties, and insular areas to develop stronger, more resilient communities by providing decent housing and a suitable living environment, and by expanding economic opportunities, principally for low- and moderate-income people.

"Monday, May 6, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_102,"HUD Extends Additional Relief to Borrowers in Maui, HI","WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), through the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), announced it is extending its foreclosure moratorium for borrowers with FHA-insured mortgages in Maui County, HI, through August 4, 2024. FHA is taking this action due to the extent of the devastation from the wildfires, the reduced capacity for borrowers to access needed resources, and the unique challenges associated with the geographic location of Maui. The extension will provide affected borrowers more time to obtain federal, state, and local assistance, to work with a HUD-certified housing counselor, and/or to rebuild without the added burden of dealing with foreclosure actions. FHA’s foreclosure moratorium for Maui County has been in place for eight months and was set to expire on May 6, 2024. “This past September, I visited Maui and saw the damage that wildfires inflicted on homes, communities, and families. I also met with local officials, ensuring them that HUD and the entire Biden-Harris Administration is with them for the long haul,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “Today, we are extending our foreclosure moratorium once again, assuring Maui homeowners that HUD continues to support their full recovery from this disaster.” “We’ve extended the foreclosure moratorium in Maui County, a county that experienced extreme devastation,” said Federal Housing Commissioner Julia Gordon. “We remain committed to doing all that we can to help the residents of Maui County recover from this disaster.” With this extension, FHA is instructing mortgage servicers that they must not initiate new, or continue with existing, foreclosure actions on FHA-insured single family forward mortgages and Home Equity Conversion Mortgages for properties located in Maui County. For Borrowers and Renters in Maui County For those with a home with a mortgage insured by FHA in the Maui County disaster area and who are unable to make their mortgage payments, immediate relief is available. Homeowners are likely to have a range of options that can help them avoid the need to default on their mortgage or to sell their home or land. Borrowers should contact their mortgage servicer for assistance as soon as practical. Borrowers may also contact the FHA Resource Center at (800) CALL-FHA (1-800-877-8339; or for TTY 1-800-877-8339) for assistance. For borrowers and renters who need immediate housing and disaster recovery assistance, HUD-certified housing counselors are prepared and well-trained to provide guidance on the options that are available. To find a HUD-approved housing counseling agency, borrowers can use HUD’s online search tool at hud.gov/findacounselor or use our phone search by calling (800) 569-4287 or (202) 708-1455 (TTY). ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Friday, May 3, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_100,HUD Delivers First Deal to Promote Energy Efficiency and Climate Resiliency for Massachusetts Families,"QUINCY – Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) Office of Multifamily Housing Programs, announced it completed a $750,000 grant transaction under the Green and Resilient Retrofit Program (GRRP) with Wollaston Lutheran Church. Grant funds will be used to finance energy efficiency and climate resilience renovations of the Bauer House apartment community in Quincy, Massachusetts. This project represents the first instance of the incorporation of a GRRP award into a construction project to increase the energy efficiency and climate resilience of the property. “Today’s news is a milestone of HUD’s Green and Resilient Retrofit Program, marking the closure of our first grant transaction supporting climate resiliency and restoration projects in affordable housing,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “This Administration is investing to help communities like Bauer House all across the country, ensuring they have access to sustainable, affordable housing that is safe for all residents.” Bauer House is a 75-unit, four-story building serving very low-income seniors. HUD provides rental assistance via the Section 202 Supportive Housing for Low-Income Elderly program to 74 of the households at the property. Originally constructed in 1996, the property is undergoing rehabilitation to upgrade the HVAC system and improve air quality for residents. Wollaston Lutheran Church will use HUD’s GRRP funding to support the cost of replacing the existing natural gas heating and cooling system with an efficient heat pump system. “We are pleased to complete this Green and Resilient Retrofit Program funding transaction with Wollaston Lutheran Church to help upgrade the property, reduce carbon emissions, and make residents’ homes safer and more energy efficient,” said Deputy Assistant Secretary for Multifamily Housing Programs Ethan Handelman. “Funding this work at Bauer and similar properties throughout the country to improve the lives of residents is exactly what the program was designed to do.” About GRRP Funded under the Inflation Reduction Act, GRRP provides funding for direct loans and grants to make improvements to HUD-subsidized properties serving very low-income families, seniors, and persons with disabilities. Properties were selected through three distinct funding opportunities designed to meet the diverse needs of properties across the country. Funding can be used to improve energy or water efficiency, enhance indoor air quality, install zero-emission electricity generation and energy storage equipment, acquire low-emission building materials, implement building electrification strategies, or address and improve climate resilience. The program seeks to amplify recent technological advancements in energy and water efficiency and to bring a new focus on preparing for climate hazards by reducing residents’ and properties’ exposure to hazards and by protecting life, livability, and property when disaster strikes. HUD has offered funding through three GRRP award types targeting HUD-subsidized affordable housing: Elements awards provide modest funding for property owners to incorporate proven and impactful climate resilience and carbon reduction measures to the construction scopes of an in-progress recapitalization transactions. Property owners use the funds to add green or resilient elements to existing scopes of property rehabilitation. Leading Edge awards provide funding for property owners to meet ambitious carbon reduction, renewable energy generation, and resilience goals without requiring extensive technical assistance from HUD. Comprehensive awards provide funding for properties with the highest need for climate resilience and energy efficiency upgrades to undertake a deep retrofit, focused on innovative energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions reductions, green and healthy housing measures, renewable energy generation, and climate resilience investments. Comprehensive Awards are designed for the widest range of properties and are accompanied by direct support from HUD to achieve the retrofit. FACT SHEET: Green and Resilient Retrofit Program Progress to Date GRRP is the first HUD program to simultaneously invest in energy efficiency, renewable energy generation, climate resilience, and low-embodied-carbon materials in HUD-assisted multifamily housing. As of March 28, 2024, HUD has awarded $544.4 million in GRRP funding to improve 109 properties in 38 states and the District of Columbia. These GRRP investments will improve over 12,600 rental homes. GRRP projects range from targeted upgrades supplementing in-progress recapitalization efforts to major net-zero renovations. More than 700 properties have also signed up for HUD’s free energy and water consumption benchmarking service, also funded through the Inflation Reduction Act. With benchmarking, HUD-assisted housing property owners can better understand the energy and water consumption at their properties to assess potential upgrades. In addition to ensuring that participating properties undergo deep retrofit work to increase their efficiency, make them greener and more resilient to climate hazards, it will also serve to preserve these units as affordable housing long-term.

"Thursday, May 2, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_098,HUD Issues Fair Housing Act Guidance on Applications of Artificial Intelligence,"Department recommends best practices to prevent discriminatory uses of artificial intelligence in tenant screening and advertising of housing and housing-related services WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) released two guidance documents addressing the application of the Fair Housing Act to two areas in which the use of artificial intelligence poses particular concerns: the tenant screening process and its application to the advertising of housing opportunities through online platforms that use targeted ads. Today’s announcement is in accordance with President Joe Biden’s Executive Order, which called on HUD to provide guidance to combat discrimination enabled by automated or algorithmic tools used to make decisions about access to housing and in other real estate-related transactions. “Under this Administration, HUD is committed to fully enforcing the Fair Housing Act and rooting out all forms of discrimination in housing,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “Today, we have released new guidance to ensure that our partners in the private sector who utilize artificial intelligence and algorithms are aware of how the Fair Housing Act applies to these practices.” “The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex (including gender and sexual orientation), disability, and familial status,” said Demetria McCain, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. “Housing providers, tenant screening companies, advertisers, and online platforms should be aware that the Fair Housing Act applies to tenant screening and the advertising of housing, including when artificial intelligence and algorithms are used to perform these functions.” The tenant screening guidance describes fair housing issues created by tenant screening practices, including the increasing use of third-party screening companies to aid with tenant screening decisions and the emerging use of machine learning and artificial intelligence. The guidance also suggests best practices for fair, transparent, and non-discriminatory tenant screening policies, for both housing providers and companies that offer tenant screening services. The Fair Housing Act prohibits both intentional housing discrimination and housing practices that have an unjustified discriminatory effect. Housing providers and tenant screening companies both have a role to play in ensuring that tenant screenings are transparent, accurate, and fair. The tenant screening guidance makes clear that use of third-party screening companies, including those that use artificial intelligence or other advanced technologies, must comply with the Fair Housing Act, and ensure that all housing applicants are given an equal opportunity to be evaluated on their own merit. Read the tenant screening guidance here. Advertisers and online platforms should be alert about the risks of deploying targeting advertisement tools for ads covered by the Fair Housing Act. Violations of the Act may occur when certain ad targeting and delivery functions unlawfully deny consumers information about housing opportunities based on the consumers’ protected characteristics. Violations of the Act may also occur when ad targeting and delivery functions are used, on the basis of protected characteristics, to target vulnerable consumers for predatory products or services, display content that could discourage or deter potential consumers, or charge different amounts for delivered advertisements. Read the guidance for use of online platforms here. The release of these guidance documents follows HUD’s pledge in an April 4 joint statement with other federal agencies to enforce civil rights laws as new technologies like artificial intelligence become more common. HUD’s release of the tenant screening guidance also fulfils a commitment HUD made in the Biden-Harris Administration’s Blueprint for a Renters Bill of Rights. People who believe they are the victims of housing discrimination should contact HUD at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY) or file a complaint here: www.hud.gov/fairhousing/fileacomplaint. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Thursday, May 2, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_097,HUD Announces Nearly $90 Million to Make Low-income Families’ Homes Safer and Healthier,"WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced nearly $90 million available to reduce residential health hazards for low-income families, including lead-based paint hazards, carbon monoxide, mold, radon, fire safety, and asbestos, advancing President Biden’s Lead Pipe and Paint Action Plan. With this investment, since 1993, HUD has made more than $3.5 billion available to protect children, families, and individuals from exposure to lead and other hazards in their homes. “All families across our Country deserve to live in a healthy home free from toxic lead exposure and other dangerous home health hazards,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “HUD continues to fulfill the important commitments that protect children and families made under the Biden-Harris Administration's Lead Pipe and Paint Action Plan, including the new funding opportunities we have announced today.” The Housing-related Hazards Capital Fund (HRHCF) & Lead-based Paint Capital Fund Program (LBPCF) NOFO provides grants to Public Housing Authorities and Indian Housing Authorities to evaluate and reduce residential health hazards in public housing. HUD estimates that addressing health hazards like mold, carbon monoxide, fire safety, radon, and lead-based paint in public housing units will cost an average of $15,000 per unit. This is notably higher than the average of $3,500 per unit received through Capital Fund Formula grants. Funding for the evaluation and remediation of lead-based paint hazards remains a critical need as most public housing units were constructed prior to 1978, before lead-based paint was banned from residential use and have extensive potential for lead-based paint. These grants are critical particularly for children under the age of six who are most at risk of suffering the devastating effects of lead poisoning. Funding opportunities like the HRHCF and LBPCF grants address urgent health and safety issues that Public Housing Authorities are often unable to address with their annual Capital Fund Formula grants alone. These programs are part of President Biden’s Justice40 Initiative, which sets a goal that 40% of the overall benefits of certain federal climate, clean energy, affordable and sustainable housing, and other investments flow to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized by underinvestment and overburdened by pollution. Additionally, to further HUD’s commitment to addressing lead-based paint hazards, HUD’s Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes will soon release funds for the Lead Hazard Reduction and Lead Hazard Reduction Capacity Building grants for state and local governments. The Healthy Homes Production grants will also be made available, which continues to support a broad spectrum of interventions, including those addressing lead, to promote safer and more resilient living conditions, especially for families living in disadvantaged communities. Public Housing Authorities and Indian Housing Authorities have until July 1, 2024 to apply for the Housing-Related Hazards & Lead-Based Paint Capital Fund Program funding opportunity on grants.gov. Lead safety is a critical component to the Biden-Harris Administration’s strategy to protect communities against lead exposure. Today’s White House Fact Sheet reinforces the Biden-Harris Administration’s ongoing commitment to protect children and families from lead poisoning.

"Wednesday, May 1, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_096,HUD Issues New Guidance to Protect Borrowers from Appraisal Bias,"Federal Housing Administration’s new Reconsideration of Value policy requires lenders to provide a pathway for borrowers to request reviews of home appraisal valuations. WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), through the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), announced a major new step in the Department’s work to protect borrowers from racial or ethnic bias in home appraisals. FHA’s new requirement for lenders participating in its Single Family program will enable borrowers to request a re-assessment of the appraised value of their property if they believe that the appraisal was inaccurate or biased. The Reconsideration of Value policy represents months of collaboration with the Federal Housing Finance Agency to develop an aligned approach for both FHA-insured mortgages and those purchased or guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. “We know that biased home appraisals not only disproportionately harm homeowners of color, but stunt economic opportunity for the communities we serve,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “Today, we are announcing a new step in our work to root out racial and ethnic bias in home valuations, which will give borrowers greater ability to have their home valuation reconsidered.” Today’s announcement fulfills a commitment of the Interagency Task Force on Property Appraisal and Valuation Equity (PAVE), made up of leaders from 13 federal agencies, to establish a transformative set of recommendations to root out racial and ethnic bias in home valuations. “Appraisal bias harms homeowners of color at every stage of homeownership, and it can lock in inappropriately lower values for entire neighborhoods,” said Federal Housing Commissioner Julia Gordon. “Our new policies will arm homeowners, lenders, and FHA with a clear process to address biased or inaccurate appraisals.” Effective for FHA case numbers assigned on or after September 2, 2024, FHA policy contained in its Single Family Housing Policy Handbook 4000.1 will include an updated Reconsideration of Value section with new guidance on borrower initiated reconsideration of value requirements. These updates include requirements for transactions in both single family forward and Home Equity Conversion Mortgage programs. FHA’s new policy requires lenders to disclose to borrowers that they may request a reconsideration of value with instructions that explain the process, including what information will be required from a borrower and the expected Reconsideration of Value processing times. These disclosures must be provided at both the time of mortgage application and at the presentation of the appraisal. For lenders, the new policy includes: A requirement that underwriters be trained to identify and remedy appraisal deficiencies, including racial and ethnic bias; Requirements for lenders when receiving, processing, and communicating the status of the reconsideration of value requests initiated by a borrower; Standards for lender quality control of appraisal reviews and reconsiderations of value; and Standards for appraisers to respond to requests from lenders for a reconsideration of value review. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Monday, April 29, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_092,HUD Approves Settlement with Pennsylvania Housing Providers Resolving Claim of Housing Discrimination,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today it approved a Conciliation Agreement under the Fair Housing Act between the Metropolitan Management Corporation and Lancaster Court Associates and a family of former tenants. The agreement resolves allegations that the housing providers discriminated against the family when terminating their lease because a member of the family had a second child. The Fair Housing Acts makes it illegal to discriminate in the sale or rental of housing based on race, color, national origin, disability, religion, sex (including sexual orientation and gender identity), and familial status. The agreement stems from a complaint alleging that Metropolitan Management Corporation and Lancaster Court Associates violated the Fair Housing Act by having an overly rigid occupancy policy that discriminated based on familial status. The complaint alleges that when a baby was born to a family of four, Respondents terminated the family’s lease for a two-bedroom unit because of Respondents’ occupancy policy. “No tenant should be subjected to housing discrimination based on their familial status or family status as some call it” said Demetria L. McCain, Principal Deputy Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. “This agreement demonstrates HUD’s commitment to enforcing the Fair Housing Act and making sure all families have access to fair and inclusive housing.” Under the terms of the agreement, Metropolitan Management Corporation and Lancaster Court Associates will pay $70,000 to the tenants as well as attend fair housing training, develop an occupancy policy that conforms with the Fair Housing Act, and train their staff on the new occupancy policy. People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 877-8339 (Relay) or at hud.gov/fairhousing. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Monday, April 29, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_093,"Acquisition Excellence: HUD Receives an ""A+"" Grade on SBA's Annual Small Business Procurement Scorecard","WASHINGTON - For Fiscal Year (FY) 2023, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is honored to receive an annual procurement scorecard rating of “A+,” the highest grade available from the Small Business Administration (SBA). The annual Scorecard is an assessment tool that measures how well federal agencies reach their small business and socio-economic prime contracting and subcontracting goals and reports agency-specific progress. “This achievement underscores our unwavering commitment to fostering economic growth and empowering small businesses,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “This recognition reaffirms our dedication to inclusivity and innovation in procurement practices, driving forward our mission to create thriving communities nationwide.” This National Small Business Week, HUD honors the ingenuity, resilience, and vital contributions of small businesses to our economy. SBA’s Scorecard measures Federal agencies’ success in meeting their overall small business contracting goals. The “A+” recognition represents significant accomplishments made by HUD to create contracting opportunities for small business concerns in all categories. For FY 2023, HUD exceeded its small business annual prime and socio-economic goals— Small Disadvantaged, Women-Owned, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, and HUBZone. The Department awarded 35.98% of total contracting dollars to small businesses, far exceeding the 23% goal for the federal government. Additionally, the Department exceeded the heightened federal government small disadvantaged business goal of 12% and achieved 21.11%. This achievement was due to the collaborative efforts of the program offices, procurement and OSDBU staff, and the Department’s senior leadership. HUD recognizes that there is more work to be done and remains committed to continually focusing its acquisition workforce and clients on changes in acquisition policies and regulations that impact small business utilization and programs. With its robust acquisition planning processes, the Department will continue identifying areas to maximize practicable opportunities for small businesses in contracting and advancing procurement equity.

This Earth Week, HUD and the entire Biden-Harris Administration are marking achievements in supporting energy efficiency, climate resilience, and sustainability across the country. “We know that as our country invests in sustainable housing, low-income and disadvantaged communities are often left behind. Under this Administration, we have invested billions to ensure that affordable housing is similarly efficient, resilient, and sustainable,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “It’s my honor to be here with our partners in Philadelphia, during Earth Week, to celebrate their achievements as we look to build America’s green future.” Acting Secretary Todman joined U.S. Rep. Dwight Evans (PA-03), State Sen. Sharif Street, State Rep. Donna Bullock, Aren Platt, Chief Deputy Mayor of Planning and Strategic Initiatives, and Kelvin A. Jeremiah, the President & CEO of the Philadelphia Housing Authority, for a press conference at the 83-Development, an Energy Star and Green Community-certified new development, which serves 83 new units and a new street. HUD funds helped build this property through a $30 million Choice Neighborhood Implementation Grant. This site features a variety of energy-efficient and climate resilient improvements, including solar panels and storm water retention basins. Following the press conference, Acting Secretary Todman planted a tree alongside local officials, symbolizing the importance of investing in green spaces for affordable housing.

"Thursday, April 25, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_090,"Fact Sheet: HUD Prioritizes Resilient, Efficient, and Green Homes and Community Development","WASHINGTON - Under the Biden-Harris Administration, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is improving the lives of the families and communities that HUD serves by reducing energy and insurance costs and improving resilience. As the nation drives toward a clean energy and carbon free future, HUD is ensuring that low-income and historically disadvantaged communities are part of the transformation – sharing in the economic and health benefits these actions provide. Building on the historic investments under President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, over the past year, HUD has focused on increasing access to and awareness of funding opportunities and building stronger relationships with interagency partners, to collaborate on gathering climate data and ensure that climate investments enhance housing affordability. Across the Department, HUD is engaging in new and critical ways to combat our changing climate and advancing our Climate Action Plan, making significant strides towards the agency’s goals: Advancing climate resilience in our most vulnerable communities: This week, HUD announced its first actions to address extreme heat in properties and communities: establishing an internal working group to improve resilience to extreme heat, publishing a Quick Guide for Extreme Heat and launching a centralized library of technical assistance resources related to extreme heat on HUD.gov/ExtremeHeat. In February 2024, HUD published 11 standalone briefs that highlight key strategies and resources for equitable resilience, alerting and informing communities of important elements of post-disaster resilience that research has shown are often overlooked or less understood in the immediate wake of a disaster. Since 1993, HUD has provided over $100 billion to help disaster-stricken low- and moderate-income communities recover and build resilience. HUD published the Resilient Transportation and Mobility Solutions Guide, to assist communities in implementing mobility improvements to decarbonize their transportation systems, build resilience, and adapt to the impacts of natural hazards. This builds upon HUD’s work with the Department of Energy (DOE), Department of Transportation (DOT), and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the U.S. National Blueprint for Transportation Decarbonization. HUD and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) developed the Pre-Disaster Housing Planning Initiative (PDHI) to support state planning for housing recovery before disasters occur and promote collaborative approaches to housing recovery. HUD launched a website on Tribal climate resilience and adaptation, advertising maps, data sets, adaptation plans, and information on Federal funding supports for Tribes addressing climate change. In July 2023, HUD prioritized climate risk planning, requiring public housing authorities participating in the Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) to establish property-specific disaster plans under the RAD Supplemental Notice and raising the minimum energy efficiency standards applicable to new construction in the RAD program. This week, HUD published the Federal Flood Risk Management Standard (FFRMS) final rule in the Federal Register to help communities prepare for and reduce flood damage. By implementing the FFRMS, HUD will help communities become resilient to flooding, protect lives and properties, minimize damage to households, reduce insurance costs, and safeguard federal investments – ensuring that federally funded construction projects are built to withstand current and future flood risks. Ensuring that resilient HUD-supported housing is energy efficient, with reduced carbon emissions: This week, HUD and the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced the adoption of the updated Minimum Energy Standards: a final notice that will improve resident health and comfort, increase resilience of both single and multifamily homes, reduce carbon emissions for new construction, and yield significant cost savings for residents. By strengthening energy efficiency standards, HUD reduces the burden on household budgets, while protecting the environment for future generations. The energy codes adopted are estimated to result in an equivalent carbon emission reduction of taking 46,000 cars off the road every year for 30 years. In March 2024, HUD reached a significant milestone: awarding over 50 percent of funding available under its Green and Resilient Retrofit Program (GRRP) established by President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). As of today, approximately $550 million is going to 109 qualified HUD-assisted multifamily properties to decrease energy and water consumption, reduce emissions, and improve climate resilience. This HUD funding will enable nearly 13,000 homes to build climate resilience, increase energy efficiency, improve resident health, and reduce carbon emissions, with thousands more residents expected to join them as the second half of GRRP funding is awarded. HUD is helping nonprofits, local governments, affordable housing providers, private citizens, tribes and others understand and access the historic investments from the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to enhance climate resiliency, energy efficiency, renewable energy integration, healthy housing, workforce development, and environmental justice. The HUD Exchange Build for the Future site provides critical access to a curated library of funding opportunities, guidance materials, and fosters peer-to-peer knowledge sharing. It also links to the Build For the Future Funding Navigator, a continuously updated database of hundreds of opportunities searchable by development goals, audience, and funding type, which has been accessed over 20,000 times since launching in September 2023. In January 2024, HUD amplified these efforts through the “Build for the Future” Summit in Denver, CO, where key federal agencies including the EPA, DOE, USDA, and U.S. Department of the Treasury for strategic discussions with over 200 representatives from local governments and community partners around the opportunities, challenges and actions needed to successfully deploy available resources. In January 2024, HUD amplified these efforts through the “Build for the Future” Summit in Denver, CO, where key federal agencies including the EPA, DOE, USDA, and U.S. Department of the Treasury for strategic discussions with over 200 representatives from local governments and community partners around the opportunities, challenges and actions needed to successfully deploy available resources. HUD Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes (OLHCHH) is working with DOE’s Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) to coordinate efforts to make homes healthier and more energy efficient for families, reducing time and costs for making energy interventions in low-income households by establishing categorical income eligibility for HUD-assisted households for weatherization assistance. HUD's Energy Branch received two awards – the Smart Energy Decision’s 2023 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Award and the Association of Energy Engineers Institutional Energy Management Award – recognizing its remarkable initiatives in energy efficiency and sustainability for public housing authorities. In December 2023, HUD launched its free energy and water benchmarking service –funded through President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act – which provides multifamily property owners with data on energy and water consumption at their properties so they can identify opportunities for energy efficiency improvements. As of mid-April, over 787 properties, representing more than 60,000 units, are participating in this effort that is targeted to serve at least 40 percent of the assisted multifamily portfolio over the next four years. HUD’s Office of the Chief Financial Officer has implemented the inclusion of Climate Change and Environmental Justice preference points in Notices of Funding Opportunities (NOFOs) to encourage activities in support of interdepartmental initiatives. HUD now awards up to two (2) preference points for applications that invest in climate resilience, energy efficiency, and renewable energy; and up to two (2) preference points for applications that advance Environmental Justice by reducing exposure to health risks, environmental hazards, and substandard housing, especially for low-income households and communities of color. Committing to embedding environmental justice considerations across HUD programs: HUD is committed to ending housing discrimination that violates the Fair Housing Act and other civil rights authorities, including environmental discrimination. For example, following complaints of noncompliance, HUD and the City of Chicago reached an agreement in which Chicago will complete a comprehensive study of environmental burdens, health conditions, and social stressors across Chicago. HUD entered into two Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) with EPA and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in February 2024, to address the risk of exposures to lead. These MOUs will expand efforts to address lead-based paint hazards in housing and establish a pilot program to share data across agencies to identify communities and families at higher risk of health and safety hazards. In January 2024, HUD published a notice to protect families and communities from radon, simultaneously investing $3 million in radon testing and mitigation grants to public housing agencies to reduce radon exposure. Building interagency partnerships to advance climate resilience, decarbonization, and environmental justice across the country: In December 2023, HUD announced at the 28th U.N. Climate Conference (COP28) in Dubai announced that the Department would become the 15th member of the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP), committing to ensure that the needs of HUD-assisted tenants, low-income households and communities most vulnerable to both climate change and housing challenges are considered and addressed in federally supported climate research. Last week, HUD partnered with NOAA and HHS on NOAA’s Urban Heat Island Campaign, supporting community scientists in mapping the hottest neighborhoods in 14 U.S. communities. The data collected will enable HUD to develop evidence-based policies and programs to mitigate these impacts, including improving housing resilience, enhancing access to cooling infrastructure, and supporting community adaptation strategies. In January 2024, HUD sent a joint a letter with DOE and EPA to utility companies asking them to make energy and water usage data available for multifamily properties, which would help building owners access funding to increase efficiency and could significantly reduce energy and water costs. In December 2023, HUD and DOE signed an MOU to advance equitable building decarbonization through a variety of strategies that leverage both agencies’ expertise in research and development, energy technology, construction, and housing and energy policy. Investing in internal training and learning opportunities for HUD staff to gain important knowledge on climate change and environmental justice issues: Last year, over 4,000 HUD-employees attended a five-part series of conversations focused on key elements of HUD’s climate portfolio and HUD’s role in advancing a climate-resilient nation. HUD is continuing this work, hosting a second round of “Climate Convenings” for all HUD-staff focused on extreme heat, environmental justice, climate investment and other cross-cutting topics important to meeting HUD’s mission. To commemorate the Total Solar Eclipse, HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman hosted physics and astronomy students from neighboring Howard University to teach HUD staff about the eclipse, while engaging the students about the work HUD does in the path of the eclipse. This event brought together partners and staff to appreciate our environment and the natural resources that we share. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Wednesday, April 24, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_088,HUD Kicks Off a Series of New Actions to Help Communities Fight Extreme Heat,"WASHINGTON – Today, as part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s historic Earth Week initiatives, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced new actions helping support communities to increase resilience to extreme heat. For the first time in its history, HUD published a webpage on Extreme Heat that serves as a hub highlighting actions communities can take to prepare and respond to extreme heat events and available resources to help fund climate resilience projects. HUD also shared two new technical assistance products, an Extreme Heat Quick Guide, to help communities plan for extreme heat and identify mitigation strategies, and a webinar on Extreme Heat and Cold, focused on community resilience. In addition, HUD will hold a stakeholder briefing on extreme heat on May 23, 2024. “Extreme heat affects all of us. Historically underserved communities are even more vulnerable.” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “At HUD, our priority is to increase awareness about the dangers of extreme heat and support local and state leaders as well all respond to this climate hazard.” HUD is partnering with over 20 Federal agencies to participate in the National Integrated Heat Health Information System to build awareness about the dangers of extreme heat and develop solutions to reduce the negative impacts of extreme heat on communities throughout the country. Last week, HUD joined the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to announce a plan to map urban heat islands across 14 American communities. HUD also hosted a roundtable in Puerto Rico to highlight climate resilience funding opportunities in the region. Importantly, much of HUD’s work serving low-income families aligns with the Administration’s Justice40 Initiative ensuring historically marginalized communities benefit from Federal investment. These actions represent only the first element of announcements to come on HUD’s actions to address extreme heat. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Tuesday, April 23, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_087,HUD and Census Bureau Report New Residential Sales in March 2024,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Census Bureau jointly announced the following new residential sales statistics for March 2024: New Home Sales Sales of new single‐family houses in March 2024 were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 693,000, according to estimates released jointly today by the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. This is 8.8 percent (±17.2 percent)* above the revised February rate of 637,000 and is 8.3 percent (±19.5 percent)* above the March 2023 estimate of 640,000. Sales Price The median sales price of new houses sold in March 2024 was $430,700. The average sales price was $524,800. For Sale Inventory and Months’ Supply The seasonally‐adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of March was 477,000. This represents a supply of 8.3 months at the current sales rate. The April report is scheduled for release on May 23, 2024. View the full schedule in the Economic Briefing Room: The full text and tables for this release can be found at www.census.gov/construction/nrs/. EXPLANATORY NOTES These statistics are estimated from sample surveys. They are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated average relative standard errors of the preliminary data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as “2.5 percent (±3.2%) above” appears in the text, this indicates the range (‐0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90‐percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. Changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show irregular movement. It takes 3 months to establish a trend for new houses sold. Preliminary new home sales figures are subject to revision due to the survey methodology and definitions used. The survey is primarily based on a sample of houses selected from building permits. Since a “sale” is defined as a deposit taken or sales agreement signed, this can occur prior to a permit being issued. An estimate of these prior sales is included in the sales figure. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimate of total sales is revised about 3.2 percent. Changes in sales price data reflect changes in the distribution of houses by region, size, etc., as well as changes in the prices of houses with identical characteristics. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found on our website. The Census Bureau has reviewed SOC monthly and quarterly tables to ensure appropriate access, use, and disclosure avoidance protection of the confidential source data (Disclosure Review Board (DRB) approval number: CBDRB‐FY23‐0307). * The 90 percent confidence interval includes zero. In such cases, there is insufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero."
"Tuesday, April 23, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_086,HUD and Terner Housing Innovation Labs Advance Affordable Housing Initiatives,"DETROIT – Last week, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and Terner Labs cohosted an event in Detroit, Michigan, uniting leaders from the public sector, housing experts, researchers, and technologists for the third iteration of their Housing & Technology Symposium series. HUD leaders also traveled to Minneapolis, Minnesota to highlight innovative affordable housing partnerships. “These are a first-of-its-kind innovations that leverage both HUD funding and modular housing construction – a technology that PD&R and HUD are eager to help scale – to create high-quality affordable housing that is sustainable, energy-efficient, and well-integrated into the surrounding neighborhood,” said Solomon Greene, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research. “It leverages so many innovations all at once – including Minneapolis first-in-the-nation comprehensive zoning reforms – to better serve communities.” The visits were the first in HUD’s “Road to Innovation” tour series, led by the Office of Policy Development & Research (PD&R), where HUD leaders will travel around the country to uplift examples of investment in innovative construction techniques boosting affordable housing supply. The partnership with Terner Labs, announced by HUD’s former Secretary Marcia L. Fudge in 2023, aligns with the Biden-Harris administration’s Investing in America Agenda and the Administration’s housing supply action plan, offering enhanced access to funding and resources. The Detroit event explored the use of technology to promote homeownership and wealth-building for Black Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC) communities, particularly in the Midwest. Technology and development experts presented demonstrations on credit repair and policy tools, offering valuable insights into the homebuying process. Solomon Greene, HUD’s Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary in the Office of PD&R, alongside HUD Great Lakes Regional Administrator Diane Shelley, emphasized the importance of encouraging investment in homeownership assistance. “HUD is deeply committed to expanding housing and community development, with a steadfast focus on creating equitable, inclusive communities and ensuring quality, affordable homes for all individuals and families,” said Great Lakes Regional Administrator Diane Shelley. In Minneapolis, HUD leaders explored the city’s most innovative public housing initiatives. The officials toured several sites, including one of Minneapolis Public Housing Authorities’ (MPHA) sixteen Family Housing Expansion Program (FHEP) “scattered sites,” strategically located to foster community growth while meeting the cities affordability goals. Taking advantage of HUD’s Moving to Work (MTW) flexibilities and project-based vouchers, the FHEP projects have added 84 units of affordable family housing to MPHA’s stock using modular construction techniques and 16 solar roof arrays, increasing housing accessibility in a growing community. The tour concluded at Miro Apartments, showcasing a modular approach, affordable units, Opportunity Zone funds, and a large solar roof array, all contributing to housing accessibility in a growing neighborhood. The “Road to Innovation” tours will culminate in Washington, DC with HUD’s 2024 Innovative Housing Showcase slated for June 7th through 9th on the National Mall. The showcase is a public event during which leading homebuilders, technologists, and designers will show their cutting-edge approaches to increase housing supply, lower construction costs, increase energy efficiency, and reduce housing expenses. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Monday, April 22, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_085,HUD Announces Final Rule that will Protect Communities from Flooding Events and Rising Insurance Costs,"WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) published a Federal Flood Risk Management Standard (FFRMS) final rule in the Federal Register to help communities prepare for and reduce flood damage. This rule aims to protect communities from flood risk, heavy storms, increased frequency of severe weather events and disasters, changes in development patterns, and erosion. By implementing the FFRMS, communities can become resilient to flooding, protect lives and properties, minimize damage to households, reduce insurance costs, and safeguard federal investments – ensuring that federally funded construction projects are built to withstand current and future flood risks. “Across the country, I’ve seen firsthand the devastating impact flooding disasters have had on families and communities – especially those least equipped to handle the emotional and financial burden of recovery. HUD’s announcement today lessens the burden these disasters have on people,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “As climate change progresses, flooding disasters will continue to become more frequent, more severe, and more costly for families and taxpayers. This final rule will increase awareness for renters and homeowners, saving lives and reducing costs for years to come.” The final rule implements the FFRMS required by Executive Order (E.O.) 13690 by updating two of HUD’s regulations: Part 55, Floodplain Management and Protection of Wetlands and Part 200, Minimum Property Standards. This rule strengthens standards by increasing elevations and flood proofing requirements of properties in areas at risk of flooding, where federal funds are used to develop or provide financing for new construction within the now defined FFRMS floodplain. It also applies to substantial improvement to structures financed through HUD grants, subsidy programs, and applicable multifamily programs. The update to Minimum Property Standards only applies to FHA-insured new construction within the 100-year floodplain. “In updating flood risk standards, HUD is providing communities the flexibility to calculate their true risk. People of modest means are more likely to live in a flood-prone place and have a longer time recovering when disaster strikes,” said Marion McFadden, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development. “This rule will ensure HUD supported properties have the best chance of being undisturbed when flooding occurs. It is the responsibility of the federal government to ensure that taxpayer investments are built to withstand foreseeable risk – and has the added benefit of reducing the cost of flood insurance for property owners.” HUD estimates approximately 10% of new Federal Housing Administration (FHA) single family homes constructed each year are within the 100-year floodplain, and many of those homes are already located in areas where state or local standards are higher than HUD’s previous standard. The updated standard reduces FHA homeowners’ exposure to losses caused by flooding, reduces insurance costs, and most importantly protects the risk to life faced in areas of greater flood risk. Flooding is the most common and costly weather-related disaster in the United States costing taxpayers billions of dollars a year in economic losses, health impacts and funding to recover damages and rebuild or repair property. In 2023, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that the expected annual flood damages in 2020 to homes with federally backed mortgages were $9.4 billion and projected to increase to $12.8 billion annually by 2050. The impact on individual and multifamily homeowners is estimated to be equally staggering, with just 1 inch of floodwater resulting in losses ranging from $10,000 to $27,000 depending on the size of the home. When the elevation and floodproofing standards required by the rule are applied, HUD estimates the total combined benefits for each year of construction will result in approximately $56.4 million to $324.3 million of savings over the lifetime of the properties (40 years). These savings are a result of cost reductions due to decreased flood insurance premiums, reduced flood damage to buildings, cost avoided for homeowners and tenants, reduced expenses associated with relocation or temporary housing, and loss of income due to flooding events. According to the National Institute of Building Sciences, investments in elevation of structures more than pay for themselves when flooding occurs. Building to higher elevations is cost effective when subsequent flooding occurs, providing a benefit of $6 in damages avoided for every $1 invested in elevation (Natural Hazard Mitigation Saves report). Underserved communities are disproportionately impacted by flooding events. Research from real estate company Redfin found that formerly redlined neighborhoods face a 25% greater risk of flooding than non-redlined neighborhoods. There are several examples where communities have benefited from the standards outlined in this final rule. For example, as part of its 2008 flood recovery efforts, the City of Cedar Rapids, Iowa worked closely with state officials to increase their resilience to inland flooding. They implemented a variety of measures, including reassessing flood risks. In 2016 when the city experienced the second-highest flooding on record, their efforts proved successful, and they suffered less damage. After Hurricane Katrina, the State of Louisiana and the City of New Orleans used HUD funding to replace damaged public housing with new homes elevated beyond the minimum requirements at the time. When subsequent flooding occurred a decade later, because of the increased elevation of the homes, water never breached the first floor and therefore caused no property damage sparing residents the burden and expense they would have otherwise had to endure. This rule will save homes and save lives. In the past decade alone, there were more than 1,100 direct flood fatalities in the United States. This year’s spring flooding season is projected to place approximately 122 million people at risk. Elevation for flooding is already required in 80% of states and over 600 local communities and municipalities. Saving lives, keeping families in their homes, and shortening time and costs for community recovery after a flood are immeasurable benefits for communities across the country. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Friday, April 19, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_083,HUD Officials Highlight Climate Resilience Funding Opportunities in Puerto Rico and US Virgin Islands,"During a roundtable event, HUD officials shared information about the Green and Resilient Retrofit Program to over 150 participants, showcasing a new source of federal funding for affordable housing rehabilitation focused on energy efficiency and climate resilience. PUERTO RICO - This week, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) hosted a bilingual roundtable about HUD’s Green and Resilient Retrofit Program (GRRP) for stakeholders in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The roundtable was attended by over 150 participants who learned about the GRRP and other federal funding sources for upgrading and renovating properties to become more energy efficient and climate resilient. During the roundtable, HUD officials highlighted grant and loan funding opportunities under the GRRP and other federal agency sources from the Inflation Reduction Act that can help make multifamily properties participating in HUD project-based rental assistance programs around the nation more energy efficient, and more resilient against extreme weather events largely caused by climate change, while improving the homes of residents. Officials shared guidance and answered questions about the types of awards, eligibility requirements, and the funding application process. A part of President Biden’s Investing in America Agenda, the Inflation Reduction Act established the GRRP in 2022 to support energy efficiency and climate resiliency for HUD’s assisted rental portfolio. To date, $544 million of GRRP funding has been awarded for projects across the nation – representing roughly 50 percent of available program funding. The awarded projects range from targeted upgrades to major net-zero renovations for 109 properties in 36 states and the District of Columbia, affecting over 12,500 homes. “The Green and Resilient Retrofit Program is helping to improve properties and create more resilient communities for families across our nation,” said Deputy Assistant Secretary for Multifamily Housing Programs Ethan Handelman. “We are committed to creating safer and healthier homes for low-income residents and look forward to supporting more projects with funding through GRRP.” GRRP is the first HUD program to simultaneously invest in energy efficiency, renewable energy generation, climate resilience, and low-embodied-carbon materials in HUD-assisted multifamily housing. The investments under the GRRP are being made in affordable housing communities serving low-income families, in alignment with the Administration’s Justice40 Initiative. GRRP funding is designed for properties of all sizes and retrofit needs, and can be used for insulation, energy efficient windows and doors, hurricane-resistance retrofits, heat-resistant roofs, energy efficient heating and cooling, renewable energy generation, and other energy-efficiency and resilience measures. Green and Resilient Retrofit Program Background Detail The GRRP Notices of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) and more guidance detail the multiple funding options for which property owners may apply: Elements funds owners for proven and meaningful climate resilience and utility efficiency measures in projects already in the process of being recapitalized. Leading Edge funds owners with plans for ambitious retrofit activities to achieve zero energy retrofits and an advanced green certification. Comprehensive funds properties with the highest need for climate resilience and utility efficiency upgrades, regardless of prior development or environmental retrofit experience. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Friday, April 19, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_082,Ginnie Mae President Alanna McCargo Announces Resignation,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced that Alanna McCargo, President of the Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae) will resign, effective May 3, 2024. McCargo has served in the Biden-Harris Administration since January 2021, first as Senior Advisor for Housing Finance in the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for former Secretary Marcia L. Fudge and later nominated by President Biden to lead Ginnie Mae. McCargo’s confirmation, with bipartisan support by the U.S. Senate, made history as she became the first woman and woman of color at the helm of the government corporation. Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman shared her gratitude for McCargo’s service and leadership. “I thank President McCargo for her service to our country and at HUD. In her time at the agency, she has been a zealous advocate for housing affordability and ensuring a more equitable housing finance system. As President of Ginnie Mae, Alanna has helped expand Ginnie Mae’s reach in serving historically underserved communities and has been a champion for advancing market-driven initiatives that support mortgage programs across the government,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “It has been a joy to work with President McCargo. I am proud to say that she has left Ginnie Mae stronger than when she arrived, and her tenure sets a high standard for servant leadership.” “The past 3.5 years in public service with the Biden-Harris Administration has been the most important and fulfilling work of my 25-year career in housing finance and I am deeply grateful for the opportunity to serve my country and advance a bold housing agenda across the globe as President of Ginnie Mae. I am incredibly proud of what we have accomplished together and grateful for the housing leadership this Administration and agency have demonstrated since our first day in office. This has been a deeply personal decision to return to private life,” Ginnie Mae President Alanna McCargo said in a statement. “I am most proud of the team of career public servants at Ginnie Mae that I have had the privilege of working alongside since my confirmation. The talent, commitment, and dedication of the Ginnie Mae team is breathtaking, and the enormity of responsibility they carry out each day in our complex $2.5 Trillion guarantee business is remarkable. I am pleased with the progress and accomplishments Ginnie Mae has achieved during my tenure, the precision with which the team executes on our obligations and authorities, and the groundwork that we have laid for Ginnie Mae to grow and build the capacity needed to meet its crucial affordable housing and capital markets mission on behalf of the United States Government.” she said. Principal Executive Vice President (PEVP) Sam Valverde will serve as Acting President upon President McCargo’s departure.

"Thursday, April 18, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_081,HUD Makes Nearly $13 Million in Funding Available for Public Housing Agencies to Help Youth Aging out of Foster Care,"HUD encourages agencies to apply in efforts to prevent youth homelessness. WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced that it will make available $12,746,450 to public housing authorities (PHAs) on a competitive basis through HUD’s Foster Youth to Independence (FYI) Initiative to provide housing assistance to young adults transitioning out of foster care. HUD Northwest Regional Administrator Andrew Lofton made the announcement in Seattle at an event with the Seattle Housing Authority. Transitioning out of foster care can create a time of uncertainty and instability in the lives of young people and increase the risk of experiencing homelessness. FYI makes Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) assistance available to Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) in partnership with Public Child Welfare Agencies (PCWAs). This funding helps connect youth and young adults in foster care with stable housing and mitigate experiences of homelessness during their transition out of foster care. “Youth aging out of foster care are particularly vulnerable to homelessness. That is why we are so committed to making sure housing agencies have the resources they need to help at-risk youth transition from foster care to secure housing,” said Acting HUD Secretary Adrianne Todman. “Every young person deserves a stable, affordable home.” These FYI vouchers will be used to provide housing assistance to young adults in between the ages of 18 years and not more than 24 years old who left foster care or will leave foster care in the next 90 days and are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless. “One of our most essential responsibilities as a nation is the duty to care for young people,” said Richard Monocchio, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing. “Through the FYI Program and through partnerships with local PHAs and child welfare systems, HUD stands in support of youth transitioning from foster care by providing a platform for them as they begin to build toward the future of their dreams.” In nearly 15 years of working with youth exiting the foster care system, the Seattle Housing Authority (SHA) has developed an integrated model to provide personalized wraparound services designed to equip youth with the housing and education, training and employment services they need to stabilize and build toward self-sufficiency. Based on its success, and a regional network SHA partners with, it was one of the first housing authorities to receive an allocation of Foster Youth to Independence vouchers, followed by a second allocation approximately a year later. SHA’s funding flexibility through HUD’s Moving to Work program has also enabled SHA to extend the time frame for voucher and service support to formerly foster youth who are actively working to establish independence but need a little more time to be successful. Eligibility requirements to apply for the FYI Competitive vouchers can be found here. Questions regarding the FYI Competitive Notice of Funding Opportunity for Fiscal Years 2023 and 2024 should be directed to FYICompetitive@hud.gov. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Thursday, April 18, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_080,HUD Updates Multifamily Insurance Deductibles to Address Rising Costs of Wind and Storm Coverage,"Revisions will reduce costs for owners while continuing to ensure that properties have adequate insurance coverage - a key element of HUD’s work to address insurance costs and ensure communities recover from disaster WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, through the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), updated its policies for wind and named storm insurance coverage required for multifamily properties financed with an FHA-insured mortgage, as part of HUD’s broader work to address rising insurance costs. Insurance costs for multifamily properties have risen significantly in recent years, largely due to the greater frequency and severity of storms resulting from climate change. The updates announced today are designed to provide lenders and property owners greater flexibility in obtaining and negotiating property insurance premiums from insurance carriers so properties can obtain the coverage they need without unduly jeopardizing their financial stability. “I have traveled around the country, talking to homeowners about how rising housing costs are affecting them and their communities - particularly, the cost of insurance. Today, HUD is taking an additional step to address those very real challenges,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “The increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events have contributed to this steep rise in insurance costs, which is especially difficult for property owners trying to maintain affordable rents. We are working hard to bring down housing costs and increase the resilience of communities.” Extreme weather events, which are expected to continue to increase due to climate change, have had a devastating impact on communities across the country. HUD’s disaster recovery program has invested almost $100 Billion in vulnerable and at-risk communities to ensure the families and people affected can recover from this catastrophic damage. Prior to today’s announcement, HUD started to address this issue by revising its methodology for calculating the Operating Cost Adjustment Factors (OCAF) for multifamily properties to better account for rising insurance costs. In the coming months, HUD anticipates further work to address the impact of rising insurance costs across the nation. “Today’s policy change aligns FHA with practices across the industry,” said Julia Gordon, Assistant Secretary for Housing and Federal Housing Commissioner. “It will help enable FHA’s partners to continue to offer the affordable rental housing that is so desperately needed in every part of the country.” Effective immediately, FHA is increasing the maximum permissible wind or named storm deductible to the greater of $50,000 or five percent of the insurable value per location, up to a maximum amount of $475,000 per occurrence. Previous MAP Guide policy prohibited this deductible from exceeding the greater of $50,000 or one percent of the insurable value for any insured building up to a maximum amount of $250,000. “Raising the deductible amount provides important flexibility for lenders and property owners to obtain and maintain appropriate property insurance that covers their properties in the event of catastrophic weather damage, while maintaining appropriate safeguards to ensure that properties are adequately insured,” said Ethan Handelman, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Multifamily Housing. “Not only is it required by FHA, but being able to secure property insurance coverage is critical to developing new and maintaining existing affordable and market-rate multifamily rental housing.” About Wind and Named Storms Heavy rainfall, high winds and storm surges associated with intense storms have the potential to cause significant damage to property, more so than average seasonal storms that may be historically typical for any given geographical area. Because these stronger storms have the potential to cause significant damage to property, property insurance providers generally define them as “named storms” and assess an increased named storm deductible as a condition of providing coverage in the event of a catastrophic loss. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Tuesday, April 16, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_079,HUD Takes a Major Step to Boost Homeownership in Tribal Communities,"Enhanced home loan program helps to further the homeownership dream for Native American families. WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced a final rule that will increase lender participation in the Section 184 Indian Housing Loan Guarantee (Section 184) program, strengthen regulations to meet the program’s growing demands, and ensure that the program will remain a vital resource for Native American families looking to become homeowners for years to come. HUD worked closely with Tribal leaders and other stakeholders to reinforce the program, designed to bolster homeownership across Indian Country. HUD’s Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, Richard Monocchio made the announcement in Indian Country while meeting with Tribal leaders across Oklahoma. Homeownership is key to building generational wealth. By enhancing the Section 184 program, we are ensuring homeownership and wealth-building opportunities are available to Native American borrowers,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “Today’s announcement emphasizes the Biden-Harris Administration’s dedication to strengthening the Nation-to-Nation relationship with Tribes and making key investments in Indian Country. Section 184 loans can be used for new construction, rehabilitation, the purchase of an existing home, or to refinance. For example, an American Indian or Alaska Native family can utilize the program to purchase their first home, or Tribes can use the program to finance the construction of new housing for their communities. “Since its inception, the Section 184 program has guaranteed over $10 billion in mortgage loans to Native American homebuyers. “The Section 184 program is a vital tool to so many Native American homebuyers. The new regulations will bring additional transparency and predictability to this important program and is another example of the actions this Administration has taken to expand homeownership opportunities,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary Richard Monocchio. HUD’s Section 184 program allows eligible borrowers with a range of incomes the opportunity to purchase, rehab, or build quality housing on or off Tribal lands by guaranteeing home mortgages provided by private lenders. The program is synonymous with Tribal homeownership because of flexible underwriting requirements, minimal down payments, and reduced fees. The updated regulations build on past program successes, increase Native American borrower protections, and encourage new lender participation to broaden access to mortgage capital in Indian Country.

Headquarters to View Solar Eclipse,"Acting Secretary Todman invited students from the Howard University Society of Physics to see the historic event on HUD’s Weaver Building rooftop. WASHINGTON - On April 8, 2024, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman, hosted members of the student chapter of the Howard University Society of Physics to view a historic event from the vantage of HUD’s Weaver Building’s rooftop: the 2024 Solar Eclipse. “Here at HUD headquarters, on our historic Weaver Building’s rooftop, we had the opportunity to get an excellent glimpse of the 2024 Total Solar Eclipse – a historic event for those of us in North America,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “It was my honor to host a fantastic group of physics and astronomy students from neighboring Howard University, providing us at HUD the opportunity to learn from them, and an opportunity for the students to engage with HUD and gain insights into our work. Sharing this moment together was incredibly rewarding for all involved.” Acting Secretary Todman kicked off the event, speaking to HUD’s impact on communities. The event featured dual presentations – a session on the Solar Eclipse by leaders from the Howard University Society of Physics Student Chapter and interactive activities to engage the students in HUD’s work across the U.S. to promote access to safe, affordable housing.

"Wednesday, April 10, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_075,HUD and City of Indianapolis Partner to Take Possession of Indianapolis Housing Agency,"Federal and local officials jointly addressing housing conditions and operational failures impacting Indianapolis residents. WASHINGTON - Today, HUD Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary Richard J. Monocchio and Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett signed a Cooperative Endeavor Agreement (CEA) between the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the City to jointly take action to restore public confidence in and accountability over the Indianapolis Housing Agency (IHA). This action will not impact IHA residents’ access to their housing or vouchers and is being done with the sole purpose of enhancing their quality of life. The announcement follows HUD and the City’s commitment in September 2023 to pursue a collaborative approach to address IHA’s numerous operational, administrative, and financial failures that have had a detrimental impact on Indianapolis residents. “Seeing the conditions and dysfunction that have negatively impacted IHA residents, and numerous operational issues hindering the agency, HUD knew it had to take strong action to correct course as soon as possible,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Public and Indian Housing, Richard J. Monocchio. “But our efforts will be even stronger in partnership with the City and Mayor Hogsett. We have a lot of work ahead, but we intend to deliver change for residents living in IHA communities that have already waited too long.” The first action taken by HUD today was replacing the IHA Board with Kimberly Wize, who is HUD’s Indiana Field Office Director. The City of Indianapolis will soon appoint a local Recovery Monitor. Interim IHA Chief Executive Officer Greg Stocking will remain at the agency to assist with the turnaround efforts. While all parties will work together, HUD retains ultimate authority over IHA’s recovery. “This one-of-a-kind partnership between the City of Indianapolis and HUD acknowledges that a safe, stable, and habitable home is at the core of overall health and wellbeing,” said Mayor Joe Hogsett. “Today’s partnership ensures that IHA – a fundamental resource in providing housing to Indianapolis’ most vulnerable neighbors – will be fully functional, transparent, and accountable.” Unlike other receiverships undertaken by HUD, the partnership between the City and federal government in this possession signals the joint commitment to addressing the issues facing IHA residents and restoring confidence in the agency’s operations. To establish a path forward, HUD will work with the City to develop a detailed strategy to stabilize the housing agency’s operations and rectify specific issues identified by HUD. The CEA signed today outlines HUD and the City’s respective roles and responsibilities. IHA and its subsidiaries are currently responsible for managing and administering rental assistance for over 20,000 low-income individuals. A list of the properties managed by IHA can be found here. “Housing is a human right,” said Congressman André Carson. “IHA serves more than 20,000 of our neighbors, and this partnership will only further strengthen our ability to provide safe, affordable, and livable housing for years to come. I’ve long supported rental assistance, rehabilitating public housing, and more efforts to ensure Indianapolis’ housing needs are met. This partnership is a logical, innovative next step to repair an agency that so many rely on every day.” HUD and the City will be in frequent communication with IHA residents and will be as accessible as possible to guide them through upcoming changes to the agency. Residents’ rental assistance and housing will continue, and residents should see improvements to housing, programs, and services over the coming months. To inform recovery efforts, IHA, under HUD’s oversight and in partnership with the City, will soon issue a request for proposals for a management assessment and forensic audit of the agency. This next phase for IHA is critical to ensuring the individuals and families served by IHA receive the highest level of service and care. This proactive intervention over IHA aligns with HUD’s mission to ensure access to safe, affordable housing and to promote sustainable communities. By intervening and joining forces with the City, HUD aims to improve the quality of housing and enhance the overall well-being of HUD-assisted residents. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

WASHINGTON - Today, Acting Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Adrianne Todman announced a new notice of funding opportunity through the FY24 Choice Neighborhoods Planning Grant that will provide $10 million to support local planning efforts to revitalize communities. She made this announcement while addressing stakeholders at the annual National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials conference. “These resources support the creation and preservation of housing, and enhances community amenities, like grocery stores and parks,” said Acting Secretary Todman. “Paired with meaningful community engagement and thoughtful planning, this funding opportunity will help leaders and neighbors improve quality of life and attract the partners and resources that communities deserve.” Choice Neighborhoods Planning Grants support the development of comprehensive neighborhood revitalization plans which focuses on directing resources to address three core goals: Housing, People and Neighborhoods. To achieve these goals, communities must develop and implement a comprehensive neighborhood revitalization strategy, or Transformation Plan. The Transformation Plan will then become the guiding document for the revitalization of the public and/or assisted housing units while simultaneously directing the transformation of the surrounding neighborhood and positive outcomes for families. “Choice Neighborhoods Planning Grants lead to real results for public housing communities,” said Richard Monocchio, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing. “Planning Grants are a great first step to bringing partners and significant resources to distressed communities – and they better position communities to pursue the funding necessary to bring a community's vision to life.” Approximately 20 communities will be selected for Planning Grant funding, continuing the expansion of HUD’s Choice Neighborhoods program. These grants may provide funding to communities of all sizes, including small towns, mid-sized cities, large urban areas, and tribal communities. Planning Grantees will receive additional points and priority in future Implementation Grant applications. Choice Neighborhoods Implementation Grants provide up to $50 million to implement the community Transformation Plan. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Friday, April 5, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_071,HUD Investigation Finds Luxury Condominium in Puerto Rico Violates the Accessibility Requirements of the Fair Housing Act,"SAN JUAN - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is charging multiple entities for failing to design and construct Quantum Metrocenter Condominiums (“QMC”) in San Juan, Puerto Rico, in accordance with the accessibility requirements of the Fair Housing Act (“Act”) based upon a complaint initiated by HUD. These entities include the architectural firm that designed the drawings used for the construction of QMC, the general contractor, and both the original and subsequent owners. HUD has also charged some of the entities with failing to approve a reasonable accommodation request made by two residents due to the inaccessible design and construction features of QMC. Read the Charge. The Act requires multifamily housing built after March 1991 to contain accessible features for people with disabilities. The Act also prohibits discrimination because of disability, including refusing to allow reasonable accommodations that would otherwise permit homeowners with disabilities an equal opportunity to use and enjoy their housing. “It is unacceptable to deny residents equal use and enjoyment of their homes because of their disability,” said Demetria L. McCain, HUD Principal Assistant Deputy Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. “HUD is steadfast in ensuring that people with disabilities have access to their homes, in accordance with the Fair Housing Act.” “Today’s action should remind housing providers, builders, and architects that they must design and build housing that ensures equal access to individuals with disabilities,” said HUD General Counsel Damon Smith. “HUD is committed to vigorously enforcing the Act to ensure that all people have equal access and opportunity to live in the community of their choice.” HUD’s Charge of Discrimination alleges that the architectural firm, general contractor, and owners failed to include accessible building entrances on accessible routes, accessible and usable public and common use areas, usable doors in units, accessible routes in units, accessible thermostats, reinforced walls for grab bars in bathrooms, and usable kitchens and bathrooms for persons with disabilities, particularly those in wheelchairs, in the 80-residential unit two-tower buildings. The Charge also alleges the entities failed to approve a reasonable accommodation request for an accessible parking space, which would have allowed persons with disabilities to have better use of their units and the common area features of QMC, even while continuing to have to endure other inaccessible design and construction features. A United States Administrative Law Judge will hear HUD’s charge unless any party elects to have the case heard in Federal district court. If the Administrative Law Judge finds, after a hearing, that discrimination has occurred, the judge may award damages to the resident for his losses as a result of the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief to deter further discrimination, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties to vindicate the public interest. If the Federal court hears the case, the Judge may also award punitive damages to the resident. The Fair Housing Accessibility FIRST (FIRST) initiative was designed to promote compliance with the Fair Housing Act design and construction requirements. The program offers comprehensive and detailed instruction programs, useful online web resources, and a toll-free information line for technical guidance and support. Housing providers can learn more about the FIRST program here. People who believe they are the victims of housing discrimination should contact HUD at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing providers and others can learn more about their responsibility to provide reasonable accommodations for individuals with disabilities here and about accessibility requirements for multifamily housing here.

Funded through HUD's Self-Help Homeownership Opportunity Program (SHOP), four non-profit housing providers will use HUD's grants to construct or rehabilitate 445 homes along with contributed labor from the homebuyers and volunteers that, will significantly lower the cost of homeownership. “HUD is committed to investing in homeownership and creating affordable options for Americans to buy their first home,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “The SHOP program provides a unique pathway for first-time homeowners to buy a home, with financial support from HUD and the help of volunteers, buyers contribute their sweat equity to make buying a home a reality.” Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary Marion McFadden made the announcement during a Habitat for Humanity Build in Nashville, Tennessee where she stood alongside a future homeowner who used funding from SHOP to help make this happen. Organizations receive SHOP funding to help people and communities throughout the country by increasing access and availability to affordable homes. “Given the national needs to build at least two million new homes, it’s a joy to provide millions of dollars enabling homeownership by people of modest means,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development Marion McFadden. “There’s nothing more important to our wellbeing than waking up to face the day in a comfortable home.” HUD's Self-Help Homeownership Opportunity Program (SHOP) The SHOP program provides federal grants on a competitive basis to national and regional non-profit organizations and consortia that have experience in administering self-help homeownership housing programs. The SHOP grants must be used to purchase land and make necessary infrastructure improvements, which together may not exceed an average SHOP investment of $25,000 per dwelling unit. Leveraged funds must be used for the construction or rehabilitation of these homeownership units. Many of the SHOP homebuyers are first-time homeowners and come from underserved groups. Since 1996, when Congress first appropriated SHOP funds, the SHOP program has provided more than $457 million in federal grants that, together with significant leveraged funds and numerous volunteer hours, are transforming lives and neighborhoods through the production of over 33,279 units of affordable, homeownership housing. FY 2023 Self-Help Homeownership Opportunity Program (SHOP) Link to grant summaries here. Homebuyers will contribute significant sweat equity toward the development of their units and/or the units of other homebuyers participating in the local self-help housing programs. These sweat equity contributions reduce the purchase price of the SHOP units and make these units affordable for low-income homebuyers. A minimum of 100 sweat equity hours is required from a household of two or more persons. A minimum of 50 sweat equity hours is required from a household of one person. Community participation consisting of volunteer labor contributions is also required. Sweat equity and volunteer labor may include, but are not limited to, landscaping, foundation work, painting, carpentry, trim work, drywall, roofing and siding for the housing. Reasonable accommodations must be made for persons with disabilities. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

The grants will support the efforts of national, state, and local fair housing entities working to address violations of the Fair Housing Act and to end discrimination in housing. A state-by-state breakdown of the awardees is available here. “HUD is committed to rooting out any and all forms of discrimination in housing, not just through words, but through real resources,” said HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “Today, we’re awarding more than $30 million to help our partners on the ground educate the public, eliminate discriminatory housing practices, and fully enforce the Fair Housing Act.” The grant funding will allow the grantees to provide fair housing enforcement by conducting investigations, testing to identify discrimination in the rental and sales markets, and filing fair housing complaints with HUD or substantially equivalent state and local agencies. In addition, grantees will conduct education and outreach activities to inform the public, housing providers, and local governments about rights and responsibilities that exist under the Fair Housing Act. “The Fair Housing Initiatives Program provides crucial support and resources to eliminate housing discrimination in communities across the country including those experiencing discrimination based on religion, sex (including gender identity and sexual orientation), race and the Fair Housing Act’s other four protected classes,” said Demetria L. McCain, HUD’s Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. “Although the Fair Housing Act was passed nearly fifty-six years ago, far too many people still face illegal housing discrimination. Through the collaborative efforts of HUD and its fair housing partners, we continue to make every effort to root out discrimination in housing. The funds provided today will ensure that our state and local partners have the financial resources they need to fight discriminatory practices and educate the public about their fair housing rights and responsibilities.” HUD is awarding grants in the following categories and amounts: Private Enforcement Initiative (PEI) – This initiative funds non-profit fair housing organizations to carry out testing and enforcement activities to prevent or eliminate discriminatory housing practices. HUD is awarding $16,704,250 to organizations to conduct intake, provide testing, and investigate and litigate fair housing complaints under the Fair Housing Act. Education and Outreach Initiative (EOI) – This program offers support for fair housing activities that educate the public and housing providers about equal opportunity in housing and compliance with the fair housing laws. HUD is awarding $9,466,207 to organizations that educate the public and housing providers about the Fair Housing Act. These grants will also support state and local organizations that enhance fair housing laws that are substantially equivalent to the Fair Housing Act. Education and Outreach Initiative Test Coordinator Training (EOI-TCT) – FHIP is a significant source of funding for grantees that conduct fair housing testing in local communities across the country. Fair housing testing refers to the use of testers who pose as prospective renters or buyers of real estate for the purpose of determining whether housing providers, real estate agents, appraisers, lenders, and others are complying with the Fair Housing Act. HUD is awarding $500,000 to one organization to support fair housing training courses specifically in fair housing testing. Fair Housing Organizations Initiative (FHOI) – This program provides funding that builds the capacity and effectiveness of non-profit fair housing organizations by providing funds to handle fair housing enforcement and education initiatives more effectively. FHOI also strengthens the fair housing movement nationally by encouraging the creation and growth of organizations that focus on the rights and needs of underserved groups, particularly persons with disabilities. HUD is awarding $3,700,000 to nonprofit organizations to conduct fair housing enforcement related activities.

"Friday, March 29, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_065,HUD Announces Expansion of Program to Promote Innovations in Housing,"Moving to Work Program expansion enables communities to develop creative housing solutions and resident services. WASHINGTON - Today, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman announced the final cohort of Moving to Work (MTW) Demonstration program expansion after extensive collaboration with Congress, advocates, and industry groups. 14 selected housing agencies will evaluate MTW's impact on administrative efficiency and resident services. MTW offers flexibility to create customized solutions to help residents and increase housing choice for families. “We are committed to finding innovative solutions that increase and preserve our housing supply and empowers families,” said Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “With this expansion complete, we look forward to learning from these communities and applying the most promising and successful ideas to inform future policy and programs.” The program gives housing agencies the freedom to design and test local strategies, to be innovative and creative when designing and implementing policies and programs; and to come up with solutions that meet the needs of their community, and most importantly the families they serve. HUD collaborated closely with the Federal Research Advisory Council to shape policies evaluated by the five cohorts. With this milestone, 139 MTW housing agencies now operate nationwide across 40 states and D.C. Notably, 17 states without prior MTW housing agencies now have access to flexibilities. “Well performing housing agencies can take their operations to the next level with the administrative flexibility and the ability to be more creative in fulfilling their mission,” said Richard J. Monocchio, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing. “It’s an exciting time at HUD. With this final cohort, we now have 100 additional housing agencies leading locally-designed housing innovations that will contribute to the Department’s cutting-edge policy development that can be scaled nationally.” First authorized by Congress in 1996, MTW is a demonstration that provides housing agencies the opportunity to redefine how they operate by giving them flexibility to try “outside the box” ideas that address local community needs in innovative ways. MTW agencies are trailblazers in driving innovation in the delivery of providing housing and services to low-income residents. The program encourages an entrepreneurial spirit to create solutions in a new way. MTW agencies have directly influenced national policy for over 25 years, paving the way for the future delivery of federally assisted housing. The following housing agencies were selected for the MTW Flexibility II Cohort: ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Thursday, March 28, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_064,Biden-Harris Administration Announces $173 Million to Make Homes More Energy Efficient and Climate Resilient for Low-Income Americans as Part of President Biden’s Investing in America Agenda,"Over half of Green and Resilient Retrofit Program funding has now been awarded to combat the climate crisis, advance environmental justice, and improve lives for residents in HUD-supported housing. WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced $173.8 million in new grant and loan awards under its Green and Resilient Retrofit Program (GRRP), bringing the total funding awarded under this program to a total of $544 million, or more than 50 percent of funding being awarded through this program. The announcement was made today by HUD Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson at Archer Courts in Chicago, IL, which was awarded an $11.76 million grant under the program. The funds will be used by owner Jonathan Rose Companies for substantial energy efficiency renovations at this 146-unit property, which is home to low-income individuals and families. The grants and loans announced today as part of President Biden’s Investing in America agenda will support energy efficiency and climate resilience renovations at 25 properties participating in HUD’s Multifamily project-based rental assistance programs for low-income individuals, families, and seniors. All of the investments announced today will advance environmental justice in line with President Biden’s Justice40 Initiative which sets a goal that 40 percent of the overall benefits of certain federal investments flow to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized by underinvestment and overburdened by pollution. Retrofitting these homes will reduce their carbon emissions, make them more resilient to extreme weather events, and advance the President’s housing and clean energy agenda, ensuring affordable housing stays affordable for residents and building owners across the nation. Today’s awards include the first GRRP retrofit awards for properties located in the states of Colorado, Florida, Mississippi, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oregon, and Washington. “The Green and Resilient Retrofit Program is designed to improve the health, safety, quality and comfort of residents’ homes and to ensure HUD-assisted multifamily housing becomes more sustainable,” said Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to addressing the negative impacts of climate change and HUD’s programs are an important part of this work.” “Far too many Americans struggle to stay warm in the winter and cool in the summer,” said John Podesta, Senior Advisor to the President for International Climate Policy. “Today’s awards from the Department of Housing and Urban Development will boost the quality of life for thousands of moderate- and low-income American families by making their homes safer and more comfortable.” “President Biden’s Investing in America agenda has accelerated our efforts to deliver environmental justice for communities that have been left behind for too long. As part of the President’s Justice40 Initiative, every single grant awarded under this program is delivering safe and climate resilient housing for residents most in need, including many that are at risk for damage from flooding and other climate fueled-extreme weather events,” said Brenda Mallory, Chair of the White House Council on Environmental Quality. The GRRP Comprehensive awards provide funding to properties with the highest need for climate resilience and utility efficiency upgrades. The 25 properties receiving Comprehensive awards today represent a mix of property sizes, affordable housing program participation, and energy efficiency and climate resilience needs. Eight are properties participating in the HUD Section 202 project-based rental assistance program for low-income seniors and 17 are properties participating in the HUD Section 8 project-based rental assistance program for low-income individuals and families. One property has more than 200 units, 17 properties have between 51-200 units, and seven properties have 50 or fewer units. Five properties have very high need for energy efficiency improvements and 14 properties have very high climate risks which include the risk of significant damage and disruption to residents from climate and extreme weather hazards, such as extreme heat, hurricanes, flooding, and other catastrophic storm events. View the full list of grantees here. “The power of the Green and Resilient Retrofit Program to transform properties and the lives of low-income families is underscored by the variety of applications we continue to receive for energy efficiency and climate resilience projects,” said Assistant Secretary for Housing Julia Gordon. “Today’s announcement reinforces this Administration’s dual commitment to addressing climate challenges and providing safer and healthier homes for low-income families and seniors.” President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act-the largest climate investment in history-established the GRRP in 2022 to fund energy efficiency and resiliency improvements for HUD’s assisted rental portfolio. FACT SHEET: Green and Resilient Retrofit Program Progress to Date GRRP is the first HUD program to simultaneously invest in energy efficiency, renewable energy generation, climate resilience, and low-embodied-carbon materials in HUD-assisted multifamily housing. All of the investments under the GRRP will be made in affordable housing communities serving low-income families, directly benefiting HUD-assisted housing, in alignment with the Justice40 Initiative. At the 50 percent mark of planned award funding being distributed to 109 properties and more than 12,600 rental homes, to make them greener, healthier, and safer for low-income households, seniors, and persons with disabilities. The projects span the range from targeted upgrades to major net-zero renovation for properties in 38 states and the District of Columbia As of March 28, 2024, HUD has awarded $544.4 million in grants and surplus cash loans under the GRRP; $240.1 million in grants and $304.3 million in surplus cash loans. Of the awardees receiving grants and loans in six rounds of funding, 87 are properties receiving Multifamily Section 8 project-based rental assistance, 21 properties are receiving Section 202 project-based rental assistance for low-income seniors, and one is receiving Section 811 project-based rental assistance for low-income persons with disabilities. GRRP funding is being used for insulation, energy efficient windows and doors, heat-resistant roofs, energy efficient heating and cooling, resiliency measures and other improvements. GRRP is designed to work for properties of all sizes, and with a range of energy efficiency and climate resilience needs. Almost 20 properties receiving grant and loan awards have fewer than 50 units, some 70 properties have between 50 and 100 units, while 15 have more than 200 units. More than 700 properties have also signed up for HUD’s free energy and water benchmarking service, funded with more than $40 million from the President’s Inflation Reduction Act, so that HUD-assisted housing property owners can better understand the energy and water consumption at their properties in relation to other similar properties. This benchmarking information can in turn be used to assess energy efficiency and water conservation upgrades that can be funded under the GRRP. Green and Resilient Retrofit Program Background Detail The GRRP Notices of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) and additional guidance detail the multiple funding options for which property owners may apply: Elements provides funding to owners for proven and meaningful climate resilience and utility efficiency measures in projects that are already in the process of being recapitalized. Leading Edge provides funding to owners with plans for ambitious retrofit activities to achieve zero energy retrofits and an advanced green certification. Comprehensive provides funding to properties with the highest need for climate resilience and utility efficiency upgrades, regardless of prior development or environmental retrofit experience.

"Tuesday, March 26, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_062,"HUD Closes $17.7 Million Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) Transaction to Improve 100 Rental Homes in Cumberland, MD","Transaction preserves and rehabilitates affordable rental homes for seniors and persons with disabilities. WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Office of Multifamily Housing announced the recent completion of a Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) transaction with the Housing Authority of the City of Cumberland (HACC). Through the transaction, HACC will finance the preservation and rehabilitation of 100 affordable rental homes at John F. Kennedy Apartments in downtown Cumberland, Maryland. “At HUD, we’re working to ensure that homes are not just affordable, but truly quality places to live for decades to come,” said Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman. “Today, I’m happy to announce that 100 affordable rental homes in Maryland will now be preserved and rehabilitated for the families we serve.” Built in 1967, John F. Kennedy Apartments is an 11-story structure within walking distance of many neighborhood amenities. Due to its age, the building needs extensive capital improvements to keep the homes affordable and support its mostly senior residents as they age in place. Through RAD, HACC will convert dozens of efficiencies to one-bedrooms and double the number of homes that meet federal accessibility standards, making them accessible for residents with disabilities. “These affordable homes will also include updated kitchens, bathrooms, windows, doors, plumbing and HVAC systems, and enhanced onsite amenities; all necessary improvements that will help increase energy efficiency, and reduce environmental impact and utility costs.” said Deputy Assistant Secretary for Multifamily Housing Programs Ethan Handelman. HACC plans to complete construction in three phases, allowing residents to remain housed at the development throughout the renovation process. The total construction cost for the project is $17.7 million or approximately $170,000 per home, and is financed through a combination of 9 percent Low Income Housing Tax Credits, a Federal Housing Authority (FHA) risk-share loan, and funds from Maryland’s Department of Housing and Community Development. About RAD RAD was designed to help address the multi-billion-dollar nationwide backlog of deferred maintenance in the public housing portfolio and to stem the loss of affordable housing that could no longer be kept to decent standards. From the program’s inception through March 1, 2024, RAD has facilitated more than $19.3 billion in capital investment to improve or replace nearly 205,000 deeply rent-assisted homes, most of which house extremely low-income families, seniors, and persons with disabilities. Under RAD, projects funded under the public housing program convert their public housing assistance to project-based Section 8 rental assistance. Under Section 8, residents continue to pay 30 percent of their income towards rent and the housing must continue to serve those with very low and extremely low incomes, as was the case when the property was assisted through the public housing program. Residents must be notified and consulted prior to conversion, are given a right to return to assisted housing post-construction so that the same tenants can enjoy these newly preserved and improved apartments and maintain the same fundamental rights they had as public housing residents.

"Monday, March 25, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_061,"HUD Charges Grapevine, Texas Housing Authority with Disability Discrimination","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that the agency charged the Grapevine Housing Authority (“GHA”); Jane Everett, Executive Director of GHA; and Bonnie McHugh, Vice-Chair of the GHA Housing Commission, with discriminating against, and failure to provide a reasonable accommodation for a tenant with a disability. Read the charge. “A person’s disability should never interfere with their ability to maintain access to safe and affordable housing,” said Demetria L. McCain, HUD Principal Assistant Deputy Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. “Today’s charge demonstrates HUD's steadfast commitment to take appropriate action when housing providers fail to comply with the Fair Housing Act.” The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination based on disability. This includes prohibiting housing providers from making housing unavailable to persons based on disability. The Act also requires housing providers to make reasonable accommodation when necessary for persons with disabilities to have an equal opportunity to use and enjoy their homes. HUD’s Charge of Discrimination alleges that the Grapevine Housing Authority, Ms. Everett, and Ms. McHugh terminated the lease of a tenant with diabetes following a medical episode caused by his blood sugar levels. They subsequently denied his reasonable accommodation request and continued eviction proceedings against him even after his doctor had provided evidence that his symptoms were managed following a change in medication and purchase of a medical alert bracelet. “Public Housing Authorities may not evict tenants because of disability symptoms that can be reasonably accommodated,” said HUD General Counsel Damon Smith. “HUD is committed to actively enforcing the Act in its efforts to eradicate housing discrimination.” A United States Administrative Law Judge will hear HUD’s charge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If a judge finds, after a hearing, that discrimination has occurred, they may award damages to the complainant for his losses as a result of the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, to deter further discrimination, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties to vindicate the public interest. If the federal court hears the case, the judge may also award punitive damages to the complainant. People who believe they are the victims of housing discrimination should contact HUD at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY) or file a complaint here: www.hud.gov/fairhousing/fileacomplaint.

"Monday, March 25, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_060,HUD and Census Bureau Report New Residential Sales in February 2024,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Census Bureau jointly announced the following new residential sales statistics for February 2024: New Home Sales Sales of new single‐family houses in February 2024 were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 662,000, according to estimates released jointly today by the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. This is 0.3 percent (±16.2 percent)* below the revised January rate of 664,000, but is 5.9 percent (±14.3 percent)* above the February 2023 estimate of 625,000. Sales Price The median sales price of new houses sold in February 2024 was $400,500. The average sales price was $485,000. For Sale Inventory and Months’ Supply The seasonally‐adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of February was 463,000. This represents a supply of 8.4 months at the current sales rate. The March report is scheduled for release on April 23, 2024. View the full schedule in the Economic Briefing Room: www.census.gov/economic‐indicators/. The full text and tables for this release can be found at www.census.gov/construction/nrs/ EXPLANATORY NOTES These statistics are estimated from sample surveys. They are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated average relative standard errors of the preliminary data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as “2.5 percent (±3.2%) above” appears in the text, this indicates the range (‐0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90‐percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. Changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show irregular movement. It takes 3 months to establish a trend for new houses sold. Preliminary new home sales figures are subject to revision due to the survey methodology and definitions used. The survey is primarily based on a sample of houses selected from building permits. Since a “sale” is defined as a deposit taken or sales agreement signed, this can occur prior to a permit being issued. An estimate of these prior sales is included in the sales figure. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimate of total sales is revised about 3.2 percent. Changes in sales price data reflect changes in the distribution of houses by region, size, etc., as well as changes in the prices of houses with identical characteristics. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at the Census Bureau’s website. * The 90 percent confidence interval includes zero. In such cases, there is insufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero. The Census Bureau has reviewed SOC monthly and quarterly tables to ensure appropriate access, use, and disclosure avoidance protection of the confidential source data (Disclosure Review Board (DRB) approval number: CBDRB‐FY23‐0307) Special notice: Beginning with the April 2024 New Residential Sales release on May 23, 2024, the sales price range groups in the related Census table, “New Privately‐Owned Houses Sold, by Sales Price” will be updated to better reflect the current distribution of new home prices. New price groupings will also be introduced in Census’ time series file “New Houses Sold and For Sale by Price Range.” Example tables containing the new price groups are provided on the Census website, www.census.gov/construction/nrs. Data between January 2020 and March 2024 will be re‐calculated incorporating any additional data and revisions received since initial publication and re‐released in the new price groupings. Data from 2002‐2019 will be archived in a time series file with the former price groupings. In addition, data in the “Quarterly Sales by Price and Financing,” the price index for “Quarterly Single‐Family Houses Sold,” and all tables containing historical median and average sales price data will be revised between January 2020 and March 2024. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Thursday, March 21, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_059,HUD Releases First-of-its-Kind Report to Congress on the Housing Needs of Survivors of Human Trafficking,"Department provides assessment of housing needs for trafficking survivors experiencing homelessness or housing instability WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) released a report that assesses the availability and accessibility of housing and services for individuals experiencing homelessness or housing instability who are survivors of trafficking or at risk of being trafficked. “This report confirms what we at HUD know well: we cannot take a one-size-fits-all approach to affordable housing,” said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “Thanks to this critical assessment, we will know more about how to better provide housing resources to survivors of human trafficking who are experiencing homelessness or housing instability.” “Under the leadership of Secretary Fudge and the Biden-Harris Administration, we are centering the housing needs of survivors of human trafficking,” said Karlo Ng, HUD’s Director on Gender-based Violence Prevention and Equity. “This study provides vital insights from survivors of labor and sex trafficking that will inform our efforts to provide programs and services that address their needs.” The report, titled “Housing Needs of Survivors of Human Trafficking Study,” was submitted in response to Section 606 of the 2022 reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act that required HUD to examine approaches to outreach and engagement with survivors, and methods of assessing their needs; the availability of homelessness and housing services; policies and procedures that impact access to mainstream housing and services; barriers to fair housing; and best practices in housing and service delivery. The report draws from more than 18 months of intensive stakeholder engagement, coordination, and collaboration. Federal partners, including the U.S. Advisory Council on Human Trafficking, Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking, and offices throughout the U.S Department of Justice and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services helped shape the approach to the research and informed key findings. Throughout the research process, the study team sought to center the experiences of survivors and service providers. Many of the most impactful and illuminating findings come directly from survivors of sex and labor trafficking, as well as service providers on the front lines of housing, homeless assistance, victim services, and anti-trafficking programs. Under the Biden-Harris Administration, HUD has worked to reduce barriers to accessing housing, expand rental assistance, and root out discrimination in housing – all of which are imperative to serve survivors. This includes publishing an action plan to remove unnecessary barriers to housing for people with criminal records, ensuring that positive rental history plays a greater role in determining creditworthiness when trying to obtain a home loan, and issuing a record 100,000 new vouchers in three years. At the same time, HUD’s Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity is focused on rooting out harmful discrimination and bias in housing, ensuring HUD faithfully fulfills the promise of the 1968 Fair Housing Act. The report’s principal findings include: It is essential for housing and service providers to build trust to understand survivors’ needs and connect them with appropriate services when conducting outreach and engagement. Housing providers can improve access by partnering with local organizations that have built trust within their communities. The demand for most forms of housing assistance, including those specifically meant for survivors, is far greater than the resources available. Other policies, like prioritization of specific groups and age limits, or lack of necessary services can further limit survivors’ access to these resources. The systems and programs providing housing assistance and services are often complex and disconnected from each other. This makes them difficult for survivors to navigate and creates the risk of retraumatizing survivors through repeated screening and intake processes. Documentation requirements, criminal records, credit issues, lack of or poor rental history, or immigration status requirements can present barriers for survivors seeking to rent housing on the private market using a rental subsidy. Survivors face discrimination in numerous ways, including based on being members of a protected class. Discrimination and exploitative behavior by housing providers create barriers to accessing and maintaining safe housing, even when housing assistance is available. Program models that most successfully serve survivors are those that are trauma-informed and survivor-centered. Survivors have diverse backgrounds, experiences, and needs, and programs are more successful when they have the flexibility to serve these individual needs.

"Wednesday, March 20, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_058,One Year In: U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Annual Mortgage Insurance Premium Cut Saves Borrowers $600 Million,"35 percent mortgage insurance premium reduction implemented in March 2023 saved almost 700,000 FHA borrowers an average of $876 on their mortgage payments. WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today marks the one-year anniversary of its implementation of a 35 percent cut in the price of the Annual Mortgage Insurance Premium (MIP) paid by borrowers with Federal Housing Administration-insured mortgages. The reduction became effective on March 20, 2023, for all borrowers using FHA-insured mortgage financing to purchase or refinance a home. FHA’s MIP reduction remains a cornerstone of the Biden-Harris Administration’s efforts to make homeownership more accessible and affordable for the nation’s working families, particularly households of color whom FHA serves at rates that far exceed other mortgage market participants. FHA’s programs provide crucial onramps to the stability and wealth building potential made possible by owning a home. In the one year since its implementation, the premium reduction has helped more than 682,000 borrowers save an average of $876 annually, saving them nearly $600 million collectively in just the first year of their mortgages. “One year ago today, we cut mortgage insurance premiums and helped thousands of homeowners save more of their hard-earned money,” said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “This has been one of the crowning achievements of my tenure. I'm proud to reflect on the ways this historic action has already made a real difference in the lives of FHA borrowers, including many first-time homebuyers and households of color.” “At a time when homebuying has become more expensive and feels out of reach for many, the MIP cut puts money back into the pockets of American homebuyers and helps more well-qualified borrowers achieve the benefits of homeownership,” said Federal Housing Commissioner Julia Gordon. “Our ability to make such a significant premium reduction was based on a solidly performing Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund in fiscal year 2022 and prudent risk assessment of our portfolio.” About FHA’s Annual MIP FHA mortgage insurance facilitates broader availability of mortgage financing for low-and moderate-income households by reimbursing lenders for losses when a loan defaults. The mortgage insurance premium revenues received by FHA offset mortgage insurance claims it pays to lenders, enabling the program to operate without government subsidy. FHA’s annual MIP is calculated as a percentage of the outstanding loan balance. For example, an outstanding loan balance of $200,000 with a 0.55% annual MIP (the standard pricing for most FHA-insured mortgages), would yield an annual MIP amount of $1,100. Lenders typically assess the annual MIP via 12 equal payments included in a borrower’s monthly mortgage payment. The MIP constitutes a portion of the costs considered in determining a household’s eligibility for mortgage credit. A lower MIP allows more homebuyers to qualify for FHA-insured mortgages, expanding homeownership opportunities for qualified borrowers. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

The increased amounts use new methodologies for calculating and updating the program’s limits, which were announced in a final rule published on February 29, 2024. The increases better align with current market prices and are expected to encourage more lenders to offer the program to homebuyers seeking to purchase manufactured homes and the lots on which they sit. This is the first update to the Title I program loan limits since 2008 and supports the Biden-Harris Administration’s efforts to increase the supply and use of manufactured homes as an affordable housing source. “We are using every tool possible to make affordable housing available for all Americans,” said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “Today’s announcement is another positive step toward helping people to buy manufactured homes, an innovative solution to the affordable housing supply crisis.” “Updating the Title I loan limits was the next critical piece in our ongoing efforts to make the Title I Manufactured Home Loan Program work for lenders and homebuyers for whom manufactured housing offers an affordable way to meet their housing needs,” said Federal Housing Commissioner Julia R. Gordon. “We hope these changes will prompt more lenders to consider using the Title I program to meet the financing needs of consumers purchasing or refinancing manufactured homes.” Effective for FHA case numbers assigned on or after March 29, 2024, the new nationwide Title I Manufactured Home Loan Program loan limits are as follows: Combination Loan (Single-section), $148,909 Combination Loan (Multi-section), $237,096 Manufactured Home Loan (Single-section), $105,532 Manufactured Home Loan (Multi-section), $193,719 Manufactured Home Lot Loan, $43,377 FHA will recalculate the program’s loan limits on an annual basis so that they keep pace with home price changes over time.

"Wednesday, March 13, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_052,HUD Launches Website to Combat Source of Income Discrimination for Families Using Housing Vouchers,"WASHINGTON - Today, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, Richard J. Monocchio, announced the launch of HUD’s new website detailing protections against Source of Income (SOI) discrimination for families with Housing Choice Vouchers (HCVs). SOI discrimination is the practice where landlords, owners, and real estate brokers refuse to rent to current or prospective qualified tenants with an HCV or other forms of public assistance. The Source of Income Protections website serves as a “one-stop shop” for HUD stakeholders that summarizes existing materials to explain what SOI discrimination looks like, identifies states and local jurisdictions that prohibit it, and provides resources for people who believe they have experienced this form of discrimination. “Denying housing to Veterans, families with young children, or people trying to get off the street just because they get help to pay their rent preserves the legacy of discrimination, especially during this affordable housing crisis,” said Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “Source of Income protections are important for families to thrive regardless of their economic status.” HUD launches this resource in alignment with the principles laid out in the Biden-Harris Administration’s Blueprint for a Renter’s Bill of Rights, and at a time where lower income families face tremendous challenges finding safe, quality, and affordable housing. Leveraging all its resources, HUD is dedicated to ensuring that families with Housing Choice Vouchers (HCVs) have access to the housing and neighborhoods of their choice. “There is no reason that those with vouchers should face discriminatory barriers that hinder or halt their housing search. This experience is still all too common for renters, despite having Source of Income protections in many states and jurisdictions. In order to address this issue, it is important to work with stakeholders to eliminate those practices,"" said Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, Richard J. Monocchio. ""HUD’s new webpage provides useful information to everyone -- tenants, landlords, housing authorities, and others -- with the ultimate goal of improving tenants' leasing success.” SOI discrimination can, and often does, include other policies or practices that impact a potential renter’s ability to attain housing using vouchers. In states and jurisdictions covered by existing SOI protections, refusal to accept vouchers and other public assistance to pay rent, or adding additional requirements, can constitute as a form of housing discrimination. Thus, enforcing these protections is a critical component to ensuring people have fair access to the rental market. “There is growing evidence that state and local laws prohibiting Source of Income discrimination improve voucher utilization rates for public housing authorities and expand housing and neighborhood choices for voucher holders,” said Solomon Greene, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for HUD’s Office of Policy Development and Research. “As part of our role at HUD, we believe it is imperative to support evidence-based policies that advance HUD’s mission to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.” Local and state organizations may enforce illegal SOI discrimination and conduct fair housing testing to root it out. “Fair housing testing is an indispensable investigative tool to root out housing discrimination and FHEO encourages testing activities designed to identify discrimination that violates the Fair Housing Act,” said Demeteria McCain, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. “As I made clear in my February 2024 memo, Fair Housing Assistance Program (FHAP) recipients may use HUD funds to design source of income discrimination testing projects to detect discrimination that may violate the Fair Housing Act or state or local laws.” If you feel you have experienced housing choice voucher discrimination and where you live has a state or local source of income protection law, reach out to your local housing authority, fair housing organization, or legal aid. If you believe you were discriminated against under the Fair Housing Act or other federal civil rights authorities, you can file a complaint at hud.gov/fairhousing or with a Fair Housing Assistance Program if one exists in your area. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Wednesday, March 13, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_051,HUD Signs on to Historic Climate Declaration at United Nations Buildings and Climate Forum,"PARIS - Last week, during the United Nations Buildings and Climate Forum in Paris, France, representatives from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) shared information on its efforts to decarbonize and increase resiliency within its programs and housing portfolio, highlighted the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to energy efficiency, carbon reduction, and climate resilience and learned key insights into building climate resilient homes. Investing in energy efficiency measures, a top priority for the Biden-Harris Administration, not only helps tackle the climate crisis but also cuts energy costs, which is especially crucial for low-income Americans who suffer from high energy burdens, and makes homes more resilient to climate-fueled disasters. At the conclusion of the conference, the United States delegation, led by HUD, joined a group of 70 countries to adopt the Declaration de Chaillot, a foundational document for international cooperation that will enable progress towards a rapid, fair, and effective transition of the building sector to zero emissions. “There is a lot we can learn from governments and organizations across the world as we seek to build homes for the future,” said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “HUD represented the Biden-Harris Administration at the United Nations’ Buildings and Climate Forum and led the U.S. delegation’s effort to sign on to a historic climate declaration, building towards a more resilient, efficient, and sustainable future.” The Buildings and Climate Global Forum, co-organized by France and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), gathered over 1,800 participants for the first time to initiate a new impetus in international collaboration for building decarbonization and resilience after the Conference of the Parties (COP) 28, held in December 2023 in Dubai. HUD also sent a delegation to COP 28, led by then-Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry, where the agency made key announcements on its work to build more resilient, sustainable, and efficient homes: HUD signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Department of Energy to work together on domestic efforts to reduce carbon emissions in the building sector and to cut costs for consumers through energy efficiency improvements. HUD launched its Energy and Water Benchmarking Service, available for properties participating in its Multifamily project-based rental assistance programs. This new, free service provides participating multifamily property owners with data on energy and water consumption at their properties, helping them identify opportunities for energy efficiency improvements that can benefit residents and promote green investments in individual properties or entire property portfolios. HUD became the 15th member of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy’s United States Global Change Research Program (USGCRP), to guide and contribute to the U.S. government's scientific research on global climate change and ensure that state-of-the art research and data on climate change benefits the people and communities that HUD serves. Through implementation of its Climate Action Plan since October 2021, HUD has made significant progress in benchmarking, increasing energy efficiency, and increasing the resilience of HUD households. As of COP 28, 463,000 HUD-assisted units have been successfully benchmarked; almost 100,000 HUD-assisted or HUD-associated (e.g., FHA-insured) housing units have been made energy efficient or aligned to green building standards through retrofits, rehabilitations, or new construction; and over 25,000 homes affected by recent disaster events rehabilitated, reconstructed, newly constructed or elevated using HUD funds. HUD’s participation in the Buildings and Climate Forum is part of HUD’s ongoing work to build more sustainable, resilient, and efficient communities. The Department continues to deliver funds from President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act through its Green and Resilient Retrofit Program (GRRP).

Training funds can also be used to prepare students for housing counseling careers and to attract a new pipeline of professionals to the industry. “Knowledgeable housing counselors are instrumental to helping households make informed choices about their financial options,” said Assistant Secretary for Housing and Federal Housing Commissioner Julia Gordon. ""We are pleased to support these organizations that are so vital to ensuring that everyone has access to safe and affordable housing."" “Investing in professional development not only strengthens the housing counseling community; it enables them to provide the best assistance available to individuals and families that need support with their housing needs,” said Deputy Assistant Secretary for Housing Counseling David Berenbaum.

"Thursday, March 7, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_047,"Ahead of the State of the Union, President Biden Highlights the Administration’s Investments in Affordable Housing and Plan to Lower Housing Costs for Working Families","WASHINGTON - Today, as President Biden prepares to deliver the 2024 State of the Union address, the White House highlighted the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) efforts in a new fact sheet, detailing ways the Department and the entire Biden-Harris Administration are boosting housing supply and easing housing costs for Americans. This announcement builds on recent efforts by the White House and HUD. “Ahead of tonight’s State of the Union address, the Biden-Harris Administration is reinforcing the importance of expanding access to safe and affordable housing for all,” said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “Together with our partners across the federal government, we are committed to boosting our housing supply to increase affordability and removing barriers to advance homeownership.” The fact sheet includes several HUD actions to boost supply, expand assistance, and cut housing costs for everyday Americans: Expanding Assistance and Support for Renters: Over the last three years, HUD has secured rental assistance for more than 100,000 additional households. The President is calling on Congress to further expand rental assistance to more than half of a million households, including by providing a voucher guarantee for low-income veterans and youth aging out of foster care – the first such voucher guarantees in history. HUD released summaries of banned non-rent fees in its Multifamily, Public Housing, and Housing Choice Vouchers/Project Based Vouchers programs. These new resources make clear that certain fees, such as application and screening fees in Public Housing and Multifamily subsidized programs, are prohibited, and help ensure that tenants are not charged or penalized for impermissible fees. These actions build on voluntary commitments the President announced last summer from major rental housing platforms to provide customers with the total, upfront cost on rental properties on their platform.

Building Homeownership Opportunities: HUD reduced the mortgage insurance premium for Federal Housing Administration (FHA) mortgages, saving an estimated 850,000 homebuyers and homeowners an estimated $800 per year. President Biden is calling on Congress to pass a mortgage relief credit that would provide middle-class first-time homebuyers with an annual tax credit of $5,000 a year for two years. This is the equivalent of reducing the mortgage rate by more than 1.5 percentage points for two years on the median home and will help more than 3.5 million middle-class families purchase their first home over the next two years. The President continues to call on Congress to provide up to $25,000 in down payment assistance to first-generation homebuyers whose families haven’t benefited from the generational wealth building associated with homeownership. This proposal is estimated to help 400,000 families purchase their first home.

Boosting Housing Supply: The President is calling on Congress to pass legislation to build and renovate more than 2 million homes, which would close the housing supply gap and lower housing costs for renters and homeowners. This legislation would build on executive actions in the Biden-Harris Administration’s Housing Supply Action Plan that contributed to record housing construction last year. That plan includes an expansion of the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit to build or preserve 1.2 million more affordable rental units and a new Neighborhood Homes Tax Credit, the first tax provision to build or renovate affordable homes for homeownership, which would lead to the construction or preservation of over 400,000 starter homes in communities throughout the country. The President is unveiling a new $20 billion competitive grant fund as part of his Budget to support communities across the country to build more housing and lower rents and homebuying costs. This fund would support the construction of affordable multifamily rental units; incentivize local actions to remove unnecessary barriers to housing development; pilot innovative models to increase the production of affordable and workforce rental housing; and spur the construction of new starter homes for middle-class families.

When President Biden and Vice President Harris entered office in 2021, conditions were bleak. High housing costs and job losses from the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to a rise in homelessness and housing insecurity for many working families. Since the onset of the Biden-Harris Administration, Secretary Fudge has delivered on promises to invest in housing like never before. Since Fiscal Year 2021, HUD has: Built and repaired more than half a million units of affordable housing. Helped approximately 2 million homeowners with FHA mortgages avoid foreclosure and helped thousands avoid eviction. Issued more new rental assistance vouchers in the last 3 years than have been issued in any 3-year period in 20 years. Served or permanently housed more than 1.2 million people experiencing homelessness.

WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) Office of Housing Counseling has announced that $10 million in grant funding is available to eligible HUD-approved housing counseling agencies. These agencies will use the funding to prepare and equip prospective homebuyers to successfully navigate the homebuying process. This new funding will enable HUD-approved housing counseling agencies to provide culturally sensitive and linguistically appropriate services for pre- and post-purchase housing counseling, aiming to increase homeownership rates among historically underserved communities. The funding affirms the ongoing commitment of the Biden-Harris Administration to help close the racial wealth gap and address homebuying barriers that disproportionately affect marginalized communities. “HUD is committed to expanding access to homeownership, especially for those who have been shut out of homebuying opportunities for far too long,” said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “Housing counselors across America offer invaluable information and guidance. I am pleased that even more people will be able to access their services, purchase homes, and begin building wealth, thanks to today's announcement."" “HUD-approved housing counseling agencies and HUD certified housing counselors serve as trusted advisors to the next generation of homeowners, who will be the most diverse in our nation’s history,” said Assistant Secretary for Housing and Federal Housing Commissioner Julia Gordon. “Access to high quality, culturally and linguistically appropriate housing counseling can help more households attain the many benefits of homeownership, including the ability to build intergenerational wealth.” “Modeled on successful public and private sector partnership initiatives, these grants will expand access to homeownership, affirm the impact of pre- and post-purchase housing counseling, and expand the availability of HUD-approved counseling for consumers nationwide,” said Deputy Assistant Secretary for Housing Counseling David Berenbaum. More information about the submission requirements and process are available on grants.gov.

"Thursday, February 29, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_044,HUD Announces Nearly $9 Million to Support People Experiencing Homelessness in Florida through Disaster Recovery Program,"Grants will be awarded to the state and six localities to support those living in an emergency shelter, transitional housing, or a place not meant for human habitation. WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) awarded $8.7 million in Rapid Unsheltered Survivor Housing (RUSH) funding to the State of Florida and six localities impacted by Hurricane Ian to support people experiencing homelessness – those living in an emergency shelter, transitional housing, or a place not meant for human habitation. Additionally, it will address the needs of individuals and families who are homeless or at risk of homelessness and have needs not otherwise served or fully met by existing Federal disaster relief. “Natural disasters can be devastating to communities and families. These much-needed resources allow us to reach our most vulnerable neighbors in a time of crisis,” said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “HUD is committed to working with local officials and communities to rapidly rehouse individuals and families in the wake of an emergency. None of our neighbors should have to worry about whether or not they will have a safe place to sleep when disaster strikes.” This is the second allocation of RUSH funding awarded to help communities in Florida recover in the wake of the devastating storms. The first round of funding, awarded in October 2022, consisted of $6.8 million to the State of Florida and seven of the state's localities impacted by Hurricane Ian. “Before the storms, some areas of Florida already had a housing crisis,” said Marion McFadden, HUD’s Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development. “HUD is committed to investing in Florida’s recovery and monitoring the impact of these disasters on local housing needs. This funding allows us to work with our local partners to fill in the gap to make sure that Florida has the resources it needs to support people experiencing homelessness and prevent people at risk of homelessness from falling into it.” While FEMA, the Red Cross, and local community members have provided assistance to survivors, the severity of the damage and displacement endured by communities in Florida from the storms underscores the need for additional support. The following list enumerates the localities that are receiving the funding: ESG Name Second Allocation Collier County $1,150,486 State of Florida $3,839,805 Lee County $1,849,306 Orlando $350,344 Polk County $207,100 Seminole County $125,578 Volusia County $1,206,144 Total $8,728,763 The eligible activities for this funding include: For people currently experiencing homelessness: emergency shelter; rapid re-housing, which provides up to 24 months of rental assistance, financial assistance for move in costs, and supportive services; and For people who are at-risk of experiencing homelessness: homelessness prevention, which provides up to 24 months of rental assistance, utility assistance, and supportive services for people at risk of homelessness; and outreach assistance, including assistance to meet urgent needs. RUSH funding is available to help communities provide outreach, emergency shelter, rapid re-housing, and other assistance to people experiencing or at risk of homelessness who are in a disaster-affected area but cannot access all services provided by FEMA programs. HUD is providing these allocations due to a high level of displacement following the disaster. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Thursday, February 29, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_043,HUD Charges Georgia Landlords with Housing Discrimination After Denying Tenant with a Disability the Right to Keep Her Service Dog,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is charging PadSplit, Inc., a property management company, Kevin Lee Forrestal and Lydia Forrestal, the property owners, in Decatur, Georgia, with discrimination against a tenant because of her disability. HUD’s Charge of Discrimination alleges that respondents failed to grant a reasonable accommodation when a hearing-impaired complainant requested to have a service animal to assist with her disability. Read the charge. “HUD has a responsibility to protect tenants and ensure equal access to housing for all,” said Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “We will always defend people who face discrimination as we work to end it.” The Fair Housing Act (“Act”) prohibits discrimination based on disability. Such discrimination includes refusing to rent based on a person’s disability, failing to grant reasonable accommodations, or subjecting tenants to discriminatory terms and conditions. “Failing to provide a person who is deaf a reasonable accommodation is not only unacceptable, but it is also illegal disability discrimination,” said Demetria L. McCain, HUD’s Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. “This charge demonstrates HUD’s commitment to ensuring that persons can enjoy their homes in a safe manner.” HUD’s Charge of Discrimination alleges that the property’s management company and its employees, and the condominium unit’s owners, prohibited a hearing-impaired resident from using a service animal in their unit, and refused to install a visual doorbell and smoke detector, preventing her full use of her unit. Ultimately, their actions resulted in the resident’s decision to move out of the unit. “The Fair Housing Act requires housing providers to permit persons with disabilities service animals that are needed for equal enjoyment of housing,” said Damon Smith, HUD General Counsel. “The Department has made clear that we will take enforcement action to stop housing providers from subjecting their tenants to disability discrimination.” HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an ALJ finds after a hearing that retaliation has occurred, they may award damages to the complainant for harm caused by discrimination. The ALJ may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the ALJ may impose fines to vindicate the public interest. If the matter is decided in federal court, the Federal Court judge may also award punitive damages. People who believe they are the victims of housing discrimination should contact HUD at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing providers and others can learn more about their responsibility to provide reasonable accommodations and reasonable modifications for individuals with disabilities here.

"Thursday, February 29, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_042,HUD and Treasury Extend Initiative to Finance the Construction and Rehabilitation of Affordable Rental Homes for Low-Income Families,"WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) announced that they will indefinitely extend the Section 542(c) Housing Finance Agency Risk-Sharing Initiative offered through HUD’s Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and Treasury’s Federal Financing Bank (FFB). The Risk Sharing Initiative provides a critical source of cost-effective capital for state and local housing finance agencies (HFAs) that supports the creation and preservation of high quality, affordable rental homes, and its extension will allow even more HFAs to participate in this important program. Since the Biden-Harris Administration re-started the Risk Sharing Initiative in 2021, the program has already enabled access to nearly $2 billion in financing for the development or substantial rehabilitation of almost 12,000 affordable rental homes for low-income families, seniors, and persons with disabilities. FHA anticipates that approximately 38,000 additional affordable rental homes will be created or preserved through the initiative over the next ten years alone. “Simply put, the supply of housing has not kept pace with increasing demand, making housing too expensive for far too many people. HUD is using every single tool we have to ensure the families we serve can access affordable homes,” said HUD Deputy Secretary Adrianne Todman. “Today’s announcement means that, together with our partners at the Department of the Treasury, HUD will be able to continue providing the capital needed to build and preserve tens of thousands of rental units for the families who need our help.” “Today’s announcement will build on the significant progress President Biden’s Investing in America agenda has made in expanding access to affordable housing and improving housing stability across the country,” said Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo. “The state and local housing finance agencies participating in this program have demonstrated that it can be a crucial source of financing to create and preserve much-needed affordable rental homes,” said Ethan Handelman, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Multifamily Housing Programs. “We’re pleased to have the opportunity to continue partnering with the Department of the Treasury to increase the nation’s affordable housing supply.” Through the Risk Sharing Initiative, eligible state and local housing finance agencies receive credit enhancement through FHA mortgage insurance and the Federal Financing Bank purchases the FHA-insured mortgages. The initiative was previously set to cease accepting applications in September 2024, but today’s agreement provides a pathway for housing finance agencies to continue to submit applications to FHA for mortgage insurance on an ongoing basis. About the Section 542(c) Housing Finance Agency Risk-Sharing Initiative with the Federal Financing Bank The Section 542(c) Housing Finance Agency Risk-Sharing Initiative allows eligible Housing Finance Agencies (HFAs) to enter into contracts with HUD through which FHA insures multifamily mortgages originated by an HFA that are used to finance construction or rehabilitation of properties with affordable housing units. Under these contracts, HUD and the HFA share the risk of any potential loss resulting from a default of the insured mortgage. With the FHA insurance credit enhancement in place, the Federal Financing Bank will purchase the mortgage, enabling the HFA to recoup their capital and make other investments in their communities. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Thursday, February 29, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_041,HUD Announces New Actions to Support Affordability for Manufactured Homes and Communities as Part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s Housing Supply Action Plan,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is announcing today a sweeping set of new actions that will increase the availability and affordability of manufactured homes, through new opportunities that support residents of manufactured homes and manufactured housing communities, including those that are resident-owned. Manufactured housing is a central component of the Biden-Harris Administration’s strategy to increase housing supply and lower housing costs. These actions, announced in today’s White House Fact Sheet, reinforce the Biden-Harris Administration’s ongoing commitment to furthering manufactured homes as an affordable option for Americans to obtain safe and stable housing through HUD programs administered by its Federal Housing Administration (FHA), Office of Community Planning and Development (CPD), and Ginnie Mae. “Manufactured housing offers a proven solution to America’s affordable housing supply crisis,” said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “Today’s actions bring us one step closer to a future where everyone has access to housing that meets their needs.” Today, HUD launches the Preservation and Reinvestment Initiative for Community Enhancement (PRICE) Program, a first-of-its-kind federal funding opportunity to preserve and revitalize manufactured housing and manufactured housing communities. The $225 million competitive grant program provides resources to support residents of manufactured housing through repairs and rehabilitation of homes, replacement of dilapidated units, infrastructure upgrades such as water, sewer, utilities or broadband, improvements to increase community resilience in the face of extreme weather, planning activities to support manufactured housing communities, and services for homeowners including housing and mobility counseling, eviction prevention, and activities that support resident-owned management structures. Funding is available to States, local jurisdictions, Tribes, tribal partners, nonprofits, community development finance institutions (CDFIs), and other eligible entities. “Across the country, twenty-two million people call manufactured housing their homes,” said Marion McFadden, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development. “Today, I am delighted to make funding available for their unique needs. PRICE funding will enable manufactured homes and communities to remain affordable, safe, and sustainable for years to come.” Additionally, to complement the PRICE grant funding announced today, FHA has also posted a new draft policy for public feedback which, when finalized, will promote stability and preserve affordability for individuals and families who own manufactured homes sited in existing manufactured home communities. The proposed policy allows resident-owned cooperatives or other mission-oriented borrowers, including non-profits, Tribal entities, and governmental entities, to access FHA-insured financing under its Multifamily 223(f) program to purchase or refinance manufactured home communities. With this new flexibility, borrowers will have additional options that could preserve a community through new ownership, reduce future land rent costs, and finance needed community improvements. The 223(f) financing can be used in combination with any PRICE grant funding to enhance the impact of both programs for a manufactured housing community. To support the financing of individual manufactured homes titled as personal property, HUD is also announcing an important update to FHA’s Title I Manufactured Home Loan Program. With this update, FHA is announcing new methodologies for calculating the loan limits allowed under this program so that they are commensurate with current market pricing for manufactured homes, making it viable for buyers of manufactured housing and the lenders who serve them. HUD expects that new loan limits will incentivize more lenders to participate in the program and expand usage of the program by borrowers to finance a manufactured home. Title I financing can be used to purchase or refinance a manufactured home titled as personal property, a lot where a manufactured home will be installed, or both the manufactured home and the lot on which it will be installed. In addition to the new loan limits calculation methodologies announced today, FHA is also announcing that it will recalculate Title I Manufactured Home Loan Program loan limits on an annual basis so that the loan limits keep pace with home price changes over time. “Coordinating and aligning this suite of new federal actions serves as a force multiplier to expand the availability and affordability of manufactured homes,” said Julia Gordon, Assistant Secretary for Housing and Federal Housing Commissioner. “FHA’s updated and expanded financing options complement the work of our colleagues in HUD’s Office of Community Planning and Development and Ginnie Mae, thereby delivering comprehensive federal support for quality, affordable, manufactured homes in both urban and rural areas.” Today, Ginnie Mae has also announced a crucial step towards reinvigorating its Title I Loan Securitization program, a critical source of capital for lenders to attain greater liquidity to support manufactured housing supply. In conjunction with FHA’s manufactured housing actions, Ginnie Mae has announced revisions to its financial eligibility requirements for Title I Issuers in order to reduce barriers to entry and increase lender participation in its securitization program for Title I loans. This announcement represents meaningful progress, following Ginnie Mae’s comprehensive review of its Manufactured Housing Program last year. “Ginnie Mae plays a crucial role in supporting the financing of affordable housing supply, and manufactured housing is an important part of the solution,” said Ginnie Mae President Alanna McCargo. “We’ve consulted the industry and worked closely with FHA to update and align our Title I eligibility requirements to support more financing in tandem with the vast improvements FHA is making to its program. Today’s announcement marks significant progress in expanding access to the secondary market for more Title I Issuers and deploying more capital for manufactured housing lending going forward.” These actions build on HUD’s ongoing work to support manufactured housing as part of the Administration’s housing supply and affordability agenda. Earlier this year HUD published a proposed rule for the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program that emphasized the importance of considering the needs of manufactured housing communities during local planning processes. HUD also recently updated the CDBG in Support of Housing Activities notice to clarify that communities may use CDBG funds for acquisition of manufactured housing units, services to homeowners of manufactured housing units, and investments in infrastructure and resilience for manufactured housing communities. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Monday, February 26, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_039,HUD and Census Bureau Report New Residential Sales in January 2024,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Census Bureau jointly announced the following new residential sales statistics for January 2024: New Home Sales Sales of new single‐family houses in January 2024 were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 661,000, according to estimates released jointly today by the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. This is 1.5 percent (±19.9 percent)* above the revised December rate of 651,000 and is 1.8 percent (±19.4 percent)* above the January 2023 estimate of 649,000. Sales Price The median sales price of new houses sold in January 2024 was $420,700. The average sales price was $534,300. For Sale Inventory and Months’ Supply The seasonally‐adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of January was 456,000. This represents a supply of 8.3 months at the current sales rate. The February report is scheduled for release on March 25, 2024. View the full schedule in the Economic Briefing Room. The full text and tables for this release can be found here. EXPLANATORY NOTES These statistics are estimated from sample surveys. They are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated average relative standard errors of the preliminary data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as “2.5 percent (±3.2%) above” appears in the text, this indicates the range (‐0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90‐percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. Changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show irregular movement. It takes 3 months to establish a trend for new houses sold. Preliminary new home sales figures are subject to revision due to the survey methodology and definitions used. The survey is primarily based on a sample of houses selected from building permits. Since a “sale” is defined as a deposit taken or sales agreement signed, this can occur prior to a permit being issued. An estimate of these prior sales is included in the sales figure. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimate of total sales is revised about 3.4 percent. Changes in sales price data reflect changes in the distribution of houses by region, size, etc., as well as changes in the prices of houses with identical characteristics.

"Monday, February 26, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_038,HUD and VA Award $14 Million to Help Homeless Veterans Find Permanent Housing,"WASHINGTON - In an effort to help homeless veterans and their families find permanent housing, The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) awarded $14 million in HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) vouchers to 66 Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) across the country for over 1,400 vouchers. Please see the list of awardees here. “HUD is committed to ending veteran homelessness once and for all,” said Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “These HUD-VASH voucher awards help us to reach that goal. We will continue to work with our local Veterans Affairs Medical Center partners at public housing agencies across the country so we can get veterans and their families off the streets and into affordable housing.” “One Veteran experiencing homelessness will always be one too many - and we will do everything in our power to ensure that Veterans get the safe, stable housing they deserve,” said VA Secretary Denis McDonough. “HUD-VASH has been one of the most effective tools in our toolkit, empowering VA and HUD to provide more housing and wraparound services to more homeless and at-risk Veterans than ever before. Together, we will not rest until Veteran homelessness is a thing of the past.” The HUD-VASH program provides housing and an array of supportive services to veterans experiencing homelessness by combining rental assistance from HUD with case management and clinical services provided by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. “As President Biden reminds us, our one truly sacred obligation is to the men and women of the United States Military Services,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary Richard Monocchio. “The continued success of the HUD-VASH program stands as testament to our collective devotion to caring for Veterans and their families when they return home. At HUD we are committed to continuing to strengthen the HUD-VASH program to serve as many Veterans as possible.” Through this program, HUD and VA’s mission is to end homelessness by assisting veterans and their families in obtaining permanent and sustainable housing with access to high-quality health care and supportive services, and to ensure that homelessness is otherwise prevented. Thanks to the joint efforts of HUD, VA, and the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH), the number of Veterans experiencing homelessness has fallen by 4% since early 2020, and by 52% since 2010. Additionally, VA and HUD partnered to permanently house more than 46,000 homeless Veterans in 2023, surpassing the calendar year goal by 22.5%. Currently, there are over 110,000 HUD-VASH vouchers being administered by over 700 PHAs. Since 2008 HUD has issued new HUD-VASH vouchers every year. Additionally, over 81,000 of those total vouchers are actively under lease by HUD-VASH veterans, with many additional veterans having been issued vouchers and currently searching for housing to lease. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Monday, February 26, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_037,"HUD, EPA, and CDC Announce Interagency Commitments to More Robust Collaboration on Addressing Risks of Exposures to Lead","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) today announced two complementary agreements to further their “whole of government” approach to strengthen these agencies’ shared work in ensuring that children, especially those at high risk, are not exposed to human health risks from lead hazards. These two Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) support commitments made in the Lead and Paint Action Plan, EPA’s Strategic Plan, HUD’s Strategic Plan, and HHS’s Strategic Plan, which seek to reduce lead exposures locally with a focus on underserved communities and promote environmental justice through a whole of government approach. One MOU expands, updates, and reaffirms a 1997 agreement between EPA and HUD to coordinate their enforcement efforts addressing lead-based paint hazards in housing. “With this agreement, we will collaborate across the federal government to enforce the laws that aim to ensure the healthy housing future that American children deserve,” said Matthew Ammon, Director of HUD’s Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes, “HUD is proud to join our federal partners at EPA to better align our enforcement efforts and ensure that we are protecting families – especially families with limited resources – from lead-based paint hazards in their home.” “EPA is committed to working with our federal partners to protect children from the harmful effects of lead poisoning, which remains far too prevalent in communities across America,” said David M. Uhlmann, Assistant Administrator for EPA’s Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance. “Today’s agreement demonstrates that EPA and HUD will enforce the law fairly and aggressively to protect children, particularly those living in overburdened and underserved communities, from exposure to lead-based paint in their homes.” The second MOU, signed by EPA, HUD and CDC launches a pilot program in the agencies’ Region 3, which includes Delaware, the District of Columbia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia, to facilitate information sharing about communities with high blood lead levels or higher lead exposure risks, to help them focus their respective and collaborative efforts working in communities with the greatest risks. The agencies plan to use the knowledge gained from the pilot to expand the scope of this effort. ""HUD is pleased to collaborate with its EPA and CDC partners on this pilot that we hope will provide the basis for an enhanced national framework for sharing and using information on the sources of lead exposures at the community and even neighborhood levels,” said HUD Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes Director Matthew Ammon. “HUD has a particular interest in using the shared data to facilitate its engagement with state and local lead hazard control programs, healthy homes programs, and housing rehabilitation programs, for the purposes of improving its targeting of funding, conducting special projects, or other collaborations.” “Our three agencies will work together to identify, reach, and assist communities most at risk from exposure to lead,” said EPA Mid-Atlantic Regional Administrator Adam Ortiz. “Through this pilot program, we will develop more effective processes for sharing actionable information on lead exposure, with the goal of alleviating the negative health impacts that still burden too many people across our region.” “All children deserve to grow up without lead burdening their minds and bodies,” said Aaron Bernstein, Director of CDC’s National Center for Environmental Health, “We are committed to working together to leave no child behind and put an end to lead poisoning.” Over 1 million children in the United States suffer from the irreversible impacts of lead poisoning, including reduced intelligence, behavioral and learning disabilities, and effects on many other body systems; new cases continue to be diagnosed every year. Lead-contaminated dust from chipped or peeling lead-based paint is one of the most common causes of elevated blood lead levels in children. Adults with exposure to lead can develop symptoms such as high blood pressure, memory loss and reduced motor skills. Infants and children are especially vulnerable to lead paint exposure because their growing bodies absorb more lead than adults do, and their brains and nervous systems are more sensitive to the damaging effects of lead. They can be exposed from multiple sources and may experience irreversible and life-long health effects. More than 34 million homes in the US have lead paint somewhere in the building. About 3.3 million homes in the US have children less than six years of age facing one or more lead-based paint hazards, including over 2 million low-income households. The EPA-HUD Memorandum of Understanding Lead Paint Compliance and Enforcement and the EPA Region 3-HUD-CDC Memorandum of Understanding for sharing of data can both be found on EPA’s Enforcing Lead Laws and Regulations webpage. You can find out more about identifying and addressing housing health and safety hazards, including those from lead, on HUD’s Healthy Homes website. Learn more about EPA’s efforts to reduce lead exposure and help protect children from lead paint by identifying and reporting lead paint violations to EPA, or identifying and reporting violations, especially in assisted housing to HUD. HUD, EPA, and HHS are supporting the 2019 Federal Lead Action Plan, which was designed to reduce exposure to lead and improve children’s health. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced nearly $4 million in awards to eleven grantees to support research that will fill crucial knowledge gaps and help build the evidence base to accelerate the adoption of innovative and effective practices and policies to increase the production and supply of quality, affordable housing. This includes exploring office-to-residential conversions, to help communities meet their housing needs. “As we’re seeing more and more, our nation’s housing stock does not meet the needs of our growing country,” said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “We need to think creatively, from innovative construction methods to office-to-residential conversions. Today’s announcement will spur the innovation needed to build more affordable, safe, and sustainable housing in our communities.” “The widening gap between housing supply and demand has driven up housing costs and constrained affordable choices for low-and moderate-income families.” said Solomon Greene, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research. “We know that state and local leaders are at the forefront of innovative solutions, including using innovative construction technologies, adopting pro-housing zoning and land use reforms, and converting underutilized office and commercial buildings to housing. With these research awards, HUD aims to fill critical knowledge gaps, test pilots and new innovations, and share best practices in each of the areas.” The Offsite Construction and Land Use Reform Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) awarded a total of $3 million to 10 institutions to conduct innovative research to assess the potential for off-site construction methods and zoning and land use reforms to increase the supply of quality affordable housing and reduce housing expenses for low- and moderate-income owners and renters. The Office to Residential Conversions Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) awarded a total of $858,261.91 to study recent efforts to convert downtown office buildings to properties with residential units since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. See the specific awardees, amounts, and projects for both awards below. These awards, and the insights they will yield, are a key part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s Housing Supply Action Plan. They also build upon the research needs that are identified in the Off-site Construction for Housing: Research Roadmap, which can help overcome the barriers and challenges of off-site construction. Awardees: Offsite Construction and Land Use Reform Notice of Funding Opportunity The National Institute of Building Sciences was awarded $499,878 to partner with six HUD regions to design pilot programs that will both identify regional barriers to the adoption of off-site construction and develop strategic plans for off-site construction growth. These regional pilots will serve as the basis for a pilot handbook to spur other regions to foster off-site construction capacity and encourage uptake. The University of California, Los Angeles was awarded $458,340 to study the impact of accessory dwelling unit (ADU) legalization and production in California on rents and prices, as well as to assess how legalization changes land values even for parcels that do not exercise the new development option. The University of California, Irvine, was awarded $343,244 to study the impact of California's state-level reforms aimed at mitigating regulatory barriers obstructing the development of accessory dwelling units (ADUs) in the context of affirmatively furthering fair housing (AFFH). The Urban Institute was awarded $263,874 to leverage its housing market forecast model to examine the interplay between local zoning reforms and their impact on housing costs and segregation. Purdue University was awarded $263,847 to study the role of building codes as a land-use restriction. The goal of the research is to provide greater clarity for state and local governments in determining how proposed revisions to the International Building Code and International Code Council would impact new supply and affordability in their jurisdictions. Louisiana State University was awarded $263,650.42 to conduct a life-cycle cost analysis of disaster-resilient affordable housing and identify improvements to the manufacturing and siting process of elevated, wind-resilient manufactured homes that could enable greater adoption of these homes, particularly in disaster-prone and underserved communities. The Manufactured Housing Institute was awarded $263,544.87 will examine the impact of local barriers on the placement of manufactured homes and propose necessary regulatory reforms to address these constraints. Washington State University was awarded $226,756.05 to focus on modular construction methods; specifically, this project aims to develop and demonstrate the design of modular mass timber hybrid construction to offer a solution that is more sustainable, affordable, and equitable for housing in the United States. ADL Ventures was awarded $219,143 to study the financing of industrialized off-site construction and identify ways to increase the industry’s access to capital. Lehigh University was awarded $196,722.42 to conduct a qualitative survey of ADU ordinances, cataloging best practices, design guidelines, pre-approved plans, and other financial incentives that contributed to the successful implementation of ADU reforms in small-to-medium-sized municipalities. Awardee: Office to Residential Conversions Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) M. Arthur Gensler Jr. & Associates, Inc. was awarded $858,261.91 to conduct a study that will analyze office to residential conversion activities in six cities, test the financial feasibility of these conversions, study policies and incentives, and build an online community guide to allow local policymakers to estimate the impact of potential conversion policies on their community. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Thursday, February 22, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_034,"HUD Awards $73.5 Million to Make Housing Safer, More Efficient, and Climate Resilient for Low-Income Americans as Part of President Biden’s Investing in America Agenda","WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced it is awarding $73.5 million in new loans and grants under the Green and Resilient Retrofit Program (GRRP) to support extensive energy efficiency and climate resilience renovations for low-income Americans as part of President Biden’s Investing in America agenda. The investment from President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act will make homes safer, more efficient, and resilient to the climate crisis at 10 HUD-assisted multifamily properties that provide affordable housing for approximately 1,400 low-income families, including 44 homes for low-income seniors. The announcement was made at Stuart Gardens apartments in Newport News, VA, one of the properties receiving funding under the program, which is owned by affordable housing provider Vitus. As of today, HUD has made more than $368 million in GRRP awards to support renovations at 84 multifamily properties that will improve over 9,000 homes for very low-income households, seniors, and people with disabilities. “The Green and Resilient Retrofit Program ensures low-income individuals and families are not left out of the climate change conversation,” said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “HUD wants these families to have better access to clean energy upgrades like solar panels and modern and efficient heating and cooling systems, so that they too can have resilient homes. This additional round of funding builds on President Biden’s Investing in America agenda, as we continue to boost energy efficiency and combat climate change in communities throughout the country.” “Far too many Americans struggle to stay warm in the winter and cool in the summer,” said John Podesta, Senior Advisor to the President for International Climate Policy. “Today’s awards from the Department of Housing and Urban Development will boost the quality of life for thousands of low-income American families by making their homes safer and more comfortable.” President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act-the largest climate investment in history-established the GRRP by providing more than $800 million in grant and loan subsidy funding and $4 billion in loan commitment authority for efficiency and resiliency improvements. All the investments under the GRRP will advance President Biden’s historic environmental justice agenda, in alignment with the Administration’s Justice40 Initiative which aims to deliver 40 percent of the overall benefits of certain Federal investments to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized by underinvestment and overburdened by pollution. Retrofitting these homes will reduce their carbon emissions, make them more resilient to extreme weather events, and enhance their ability to more quickly respond to and recover from such events. The grants and loans announced today are the second set of awards that HUD has made under the GRRP’s Leading Edge category, which requires property owners to commit to achieving recognized high-performance green building certifications, such as the National Green Building Standard’s Gold certification with the Green+ Net Zero Energy designation. The certifications recognize significant property upgrades, such as on-site solar power generation, wind turbines, impact- and wind-resistant roofing, and other substantial energy efficiency and climate resilience improvements. “Today’s award for Stuart Gardens will help Vitus invest in their property to make it more efficient and resilient for the long-term benefit of the families that live there and the Newport News community,” said Ethan Handelman, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Multifamily Housing Programs. “This is what GRRP awards are doing around the country - investing in homes and communities to make them healthier and more resilient for the future.” The 10 properties receiving Leading Edge awards represent a mix of property sizes. The majority are supported by HUD’s Multifamily Section 8 project-based rental assistance program. Six of the properties have between 100 and 200 affordable rental homes, while two properties are smaller than 100 homes. One property, supported by HUD’s Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly program for low-income seniors, has 44 homes. About GRRP GRRP is the first HUD program to simultaneously invest in energy efficiency, renewable energy generation, climate resilience, and low-embodied carbon materials in HUD-assisted multifamily housing. Investments under the program will be made in affordable housing communities serving low-income families in accordance with President Biden’s agenda for building the American economy from the middle out and the bottom up. The GRRP Notices of Funding Opportunity (NOFOs) and accompanying guidance detail the multiple funding opportunities to which property owners may apply: Elements provides funding to owners for proven and meaningful climate resilience and utility efficiency measures in projects that are already in the process of being recapitalized. Leading Edge provides funding to owners with plans for ambitious retrofit activities to achieve zero energy retrofits and an advanced green certification. Comprehensive provides funding to properties with the highest need for climate resilience and utility efficiency upgrades, regardless of prior development or environmental retrofit experience. Property owners are encouraged to continue to submit applications for grant awards or loans in any of the three categories. HUD is reviewing applications under one category each month until all funding is expended. HUD expects to announce awards regularly throughout 2024. The Inflation Reduction Act also established HUD’s Energy and Water Benchmarking Service, which is available now for properties receiving rental assistance from its Multifamily project-based programs. This new, free service provides participating multifamily property owners with data on energy and water consumption at their properties to aid in identifying opportunities to improve efficiency. Property owners can also use the Energy and Water Benchmarking information to assess rehabilitation efforts that may be eligible for grant or loan funding under the GRRP or other sources of funding.

"Wednesday, February 21, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_033,Federal Housing Administration Launches New Option to Help Struggling Borrowers Keep Their Homes,"The new offering, called the Payment Supplement, will help borrowers bring their mortgage payments current and avoid foreclosure. FHA will also extend its full suite of loss mitigation options for all borrowers through April 30, 2025. WASHINGTON - The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) today announced a new loss mitigation home retention option for borrowers with FHA-insured single family forward mortgages who are behind on their mortgage payments. The new offering, called the Payment Supplement, provides mortgage servicers with an additional tool to temporarily reduce a borrower’s monthly mortgage payment by up to 25 percent without modifying the mortgage’s current interest rate. The Payment Supplement is meant to help those borrowers who cannot sufficiently be assisted by existing FHA home retention solutions because the interest rate on their mortgage is lower than current interest rates. It is the latest addition to a successful suite of FHA loss mitigation options that has kept more than 1.6 million struggling borrowers in their homes since the start of this Administration. “HUD uses every tool in our toolkit to ensure we can help struggling borrowers avoid foreclosure,” said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “Today’s new policy will enable the families we serve to get back on their feet while staying in their homes.” When implemented, the Payment Supplement will allow mortgage servicers to temporarily reduce a borrower’s mortgage payment by using funds from a Partial Claim which enables the borrower to access up to 30 percent of the outstanding balance of their FHA-insured mortgage. The Partial Claim amount is placed in a junior lien and paid back when the homeowner sells or refinances the home or the mortgage otherwise terminates. Under the Payment Supplement, the Partial Claim funds are used in the following way: First, the Partial Claim is used to pay any arrearages and to bring the borrower’s mortgage payment current. Next, the remaining funds are deposited in an FHA custodial account managed by the mortgage servicer and used to temporarily supplement the principal and interest portion of a borrower’s mortgage payment each month, with a target of up to a 25 percent reduction in monthly principal and interest payments. “FHA developed this innovative tool because after interest rates rose the FHA Recovery Modification could no longer reliably provide payment reduction to borrowers facing a hardship,” said Federal Housing Commissioner Julia Gordon. “Payment Supplement will bring borrowers current and temporarily reduce their monthly payments for up to three years, which we hope will enable them to weather their hardship and once again begin making their full mortgage payments.” The Payment Supplement option is available to all borrowers who have not already exhausted their Partial Claim allowance through previous loss mitigation actions. Mortgage servicers may begin implementing Payment Supplement on May 1, 2024, but must implement the solution for all eligible borrowers by January 1, 2025. In addition to the publication of the Payment Supplement policy, FHA also announced today that it is extending its full suite of temporary loss mitigation options through April 30, 2025. The existing loss mitigation options, originally developed as part of FHA’s COVID-19 recovery efforts, are currently available to mortgage servicers for all borrowers who are behind on their mortgage payments, regardless of the reason for their hardship. The options were originally set to expire on October 30, 2024. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Wednesday, February 21, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_032,HUD Makes $115 Million Available to Support Housing for Seniors,"AKRON - Today, as a part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s “Investing in America” tour, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Deputy Secretary Adrianne Todman announced $115 million in grant funding available to support the development and improvement of affordable rental housing for low-income seniors. The funding opportunity was announced at The Fairthorne, an affordable senior apartment building in the City of Philadelphia, alongside local and federal officials, including U.S. Rep. Dwight Evans (PA-03). “The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to ensuring that our nation’s most vulnerable seniors have access to quality affordable housing,” said HUD Deputy Secretary Adrianne Todman. “Creating these homes will enable older adults to live independently. It is important that we provide opportunities for seniors of modest means to age with grace and dignity in a supportive environment.” Offered under HUD’s Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly program, the funds will help non-profit organizations create new, or rehabilitate existing homes that are resilient and energy efficient for low-income individuals 62 years of age or older. Funding is provided to support capital costs and ongoing project rental assistance. To extend additional support, $35 million of these funds will be allocated to create intergenerational housing units with features to meet the needs of households headed by seniors who are raising children under 18 years of age. “These funds, allocated for both rental assistance and development costs, offer a solution to address the persistent housing needs of seniors across the nation,” said Assistant Secretary for Housing and Federal Housing Commissioner Julia Gordon. “We are maintaining our commitment to supporting safer, healthier, more energy efficient homes that help address both the climate crisis and the housing crisis together.” Section 202 grants offer elderly individuals aged 62 and older the chance to live independently with tailored support services, including nutrition, transportation, education, and health services. Eligible seniors typically have less than 50 percent of the area median income, with most households earning below 30 percent of the median for their locality. In October 2023, HUD announced that $161.1 million in Section 202 grants were awarded to 25 grantees in 14 states. That funding will create nearly 1,300 units for eligible households. The “Investing in America” tour highlights the Administration’s commitment to revitalizing our nation’s communities, including expanding access to affordable and safe housing. Just this week, as a part of this tour, Secretary Fudge visited Akron, OH, alongside U.S. Representative Emilia Sykes and Mayor Shammas Malik. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Wednesday, February 14, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_030,HUD Announces nearly $130 million to Empower HUD-Assisted Families Towards Financial Stability and Savings,"WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced over $128 million to 835 Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) and Project Based Rental Assistance (PBRA) owners for the 2023 Renewal and New Family Self Sufficiency (FSS) Program grants. HUD’s Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, Richard Monocchio, made the announcement in Chicago, highlighting HUD and the Biden-Harris Administration’s continued efforts to support families by providing financial resources to achieve economic independence. ""Financial literacy, job training and educational opportunities are some of the resources the FSS program connects HUD-assisted families to so that they have the chance to find employment and build assets,” said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. ""HUD remains committed to working with our local partners to empower residents and promote economic justice for all Americans.” The FSS program is a voluntary initiative offered to families in HUD-assisted housing. Participants receive coaching, referrals to services, and establish a family escrow savings account. FSS Program Coordinators provide coaching and develop local strategies to connect participating families with public and private resources. These resources aim to increase their earned income and financial empowerment, reduce or eliminate the need for welfare assistance, and facilitate progress toward economic independence and self-sufficiency. “Regardless of how much money one might make, where they live, whether or not they receive assistance, every person in this country deserves to have the sense of security for their families that comes with consistent saving,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary Richard Monocchio. “We are thrilled to offer the benefits of the FSS program to more participants than ever before.” The FSS program is the nation’s largest asset-building program for low-income families, funding over 1,450 coordinators next year, who will serve over 69,000 residents in public, voucher, and multifamily housing. In 2015, Congress authorized PBRA owners to run FSS programs. Last year was the first year that PBRA owners were allowed to apply for funding. Between last year and this year, HUD has funded 91 new PBRA FSS programs. Unequal access to savings, negative or invisible credit history, and low relative engagement in mainstream banking are national problems that especially impact renters and contribute to the racial wealth gap. This leaves renters with a minimal safety net to draw from in times of unemployment or unanticipated expenses such as car repair or medical emergencies. The FSS program helps to keep the unexpected from becoming larger financial problems through savings and support. A list of the FSS awards can be viewed here for the new awards and the renewal awards. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Wednesday, February 14, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_029,"HUD Releases 2023 Update to Equity Action Plan, Outlines New Commitments to Advance Equity","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today released the 2023 Update to its Equity Action Plan, in coordination with the Biden-Harris Administration’s whole-of-government equity agenda. This Equity Action Plan is part of the Department’s efforts to implement the President’s Executive Order on “Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government,” which reaffirmed the Administration’s commitment to deliver equity and build an America in which all can participate, prosper, and reach their full potential. “Equity is at the heart of the daily work we do as an agency,” said Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “For too long, people – particularly Black, brown and poor people – have been left out and left behind. This Administration is using our resources to reverse the deep-seated harm caused by prior federal policies and prioritize racial equity in all HUD programs.” As a leading agency that works to support America’s most historically disadvantaged populations, HUD’s Equity Action Plan prioritizes and embeds equity in the work the Department does every single day. HUD’s work, in accordance with the Biden-Harris Administration’s directive, extends to all program offices and departments and across both intra-and inter-agency initiatives. Since the release of its first-ever Equity Action Plan in 2022, HUD has: Removed some systemic barriers to homeownership and helped about a quarter of a million Black homeowners to buy a home with FHA mortgages in the last 3 years. Worked on a final rule regarding Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing (AFFH), meaningfully implementing the Fair Housing Act to address inequality, replace segregated areas with integrated communities, and transform racially and ethnically concentrated areas of poverty into areas of opportunity. Restored the Discriminatory Effects Rule, an important tool to protect fair housing and address policies that unnecessarily cause systemic inequality in housing, regardless of whether they were adopted with discriminatory intent. Expanded access to housing counseling to help Black families and individuals unlock the wealth building potential of homeownership. Awarded more than $10 million in funding to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) across the country to conduct housing and community development research that focuses on individual and community wealth building, housing affordability and stability, climate resilience, and economic opportunity. Granted $30 million to fair housing organizations to fight housing discrimination in 2023 alone. Worked to build second chances in HUD-assisted housing for people with prior criminal records. HUD works to create inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all. In the last three years, HUD programs have served or permanently housed more than 1.2 million people experiencing homelessness. HUD's Equity Action Plan reiterates its commitment to advancing equity for all communities across the nation. As this work continues, updates will be posted on HUD.gov/equity.

"Tuesday, February 13, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_028,HUD Awards $2 Million to Revitalize Smaller Communities and Develop Affordable Housing,"Grants will rejuvenate older downtown business districts and develop affordable housing while retaining the area's historic character. WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced that a total of three grantees will receive an award for a combined $2 Million in 2023 Hope VI Main Street grants. These grants will assist small communities in rejuvenating older downtown business districts and developing affordable housing while retaining the area's traditional and historic character. HUD’s Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public Housing Investments, Marianne Nazzaro, made the announcement in Kansas, highlighting the importance of rejuvenation efforts for smaller and rural communities and the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to stabilizing affordable housing for all Americans. “HUD understands the importance of preserving the character of our nation’s main streets as we work to increase the supply of affordable housing in small towns and rural communities,” said Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “Residents living in areas like these deserve to benefit from new investments and improvements.” The grant funds can be used to build new affordable housing or reconfigure obsolete or surplus commercial space or extremely substandard, vacant housing into affordable housing units. The funds awarded must be used to assist local government that have existing Main Street area rejuvenation projects and have certain population and public housing unit limits. Main Street housing units must be affordable to the initial residents that occupy the Main Street housing project. Here are the 2023 grant recipients: The City of Emporia, Kansas is being awarded a $500,000 Main Street grant to help redevelop a historic property into seven units of new housing. The City of Caney, Kansas is being awarded a $500,000 grant to help develop six affordable housing rental apartments at a historic building at the heart of Caney’s downtown. The Municipality of Manatí, Puerto Rico is being awarded a $1,000,000 grant to help redevelop fourteen affordable housing units on sites spread throughout the Municipality’s Main Street area. “We see the potential and beauty in these spaces, and we know that these investments will have a positive impact far beyond the buildings themselves,” said Deputy Assistant Secretary Nazzaro. “America is a nation of small towns, and we are proud to support these communities.” Learn more about the Main Street program here. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Monday, February 12, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_027,HUD Expands Housing Assistance Opportunities for Native Hawaiian Families,"WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) issued a final rule to expand affordable housing opportunities in the form of rental assistance to Native Hawaiian families under the Department’s Native Hawaiian Housing Block Grant (NHHBG) program. “We are committed to supporting Hawaiian communities with quality, affordable housing, especially low-income Native Hawaiian families who reside on the Hawaiian Home Lands and often face significant housing challenges,” said Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “Expanding the availability of affordable and accessible housing options will enable Native Hawaiians to maintain their housing and ensure benefits for future generations.” Under the Implementing Rental Housing Assistance for the Native Hawaiian Housing Block Grant Program final rule, HUD amends its regulations to clarify how program funds can be used for rental housing assistance, as authorized by Title VIII of the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 (NAHASDA). For example, NHHBG funds may be used for project-based or tenant-based rental assistance, as well as for the operation and maintenance of project units occupied by eligible Native Hawaiian families rather than only those units developed with NHHBG funds. The amendments also help to ensure compliance with the NHHBG program’s statutory requirements and promote consistency between NHHBG and HUD’s Indian Housing Block Grant program regulations where the programs’ statutory requirements overlap. “This final rule will further strengthen the NHHBG program,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, Richard J. Monocchio. “These changes will ensure that the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands (DHHL) can better serve more Native Hawaiian families.” In 2019, the governor of Hawaii approved administrative rules that permitted DHHL – the only recipient of the Native Hawaiian Housing Block Grant (NHHBG) – to broaden residential lease options to encompass rental housing. Following feedback from DHHL regarding rental housing projects under development, HUD reviewed its regulations. It found that they lacked sufficient explanation on how NHHBG funds could be utilized for rental assistance and could benefit from revisions to offer additional details, enhancing support for a rental housing program managed by DHHL. This review prompted HUD to issue the final rule. The final rule can be found in the Federal Register here. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Friday, February 9, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_026,HUD Announces Nearly $7 Million to Support People Experiencing Homelessness in Maui through Rapid Response Grant,"WASHINGTON - Today the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) awarded $6.9 million in Rapid Unsheltered Survivor Housing (RUSH) funding to the state of Hawai’i address the needs of individuals and families who are homeless or at risk of homelessness and have needs not otherwise served or fully met by existing Federal disaster relief programs. HUD’s Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development, Marion McFadden, made the announcement in Maui while touring the area and highlighting HUD and the Biden-Harris Administration’s continued efforts to rapidly address homelessness during the six-month anniversary of the wildfires. This additional funding is a second allocation awarded to help communities in Maui recover in the wake of the devastating wildfires. HUD provided $1.3 million in RUSH funding in August 2023. “These much-needed resources allow us to reach some of our most vulnerable neighbors at a particularly difficult time,” said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “HUD will continue to work with our federal partners, local officials and communities on the rehousing effort and support the state of Hawai’i to recover in the wake of the destructive wildfires.” Governor Josh Green, M.D., expressed gratitude on behalf of his administration and the people of Maui. “We say mahalo to HUD for the $6.9 million to help house the houseless on Maui and the 1115 Medicaid waiver that allows states to use Medicaid funds for housing,” said Governor Green. “I have said since I served in the state legislature that housing is healthcare. By making sure the houseless have a roof over their heads, we know we can decrease costs relating to caring for the houseless up to 73%. This is validation that treating shelter and housing as a source of our people’s health, is the path forward.” To balance the need to rapidly assist communities affected by disaster and accurately allocate funds based on need, HUD used a two-step allocation process. The first allocation was intended to quickly address the immediate unmet needs for homeless assistance and homeless prevention. The second allocation, announced today, used the growing quantity and quality of data on the extent of damage, particularly for rental units occupied by very-low-income households and the level of unmet need. The eligible activities for this funding include: For people currently experiencing homelessness: emergency shelter; rapid re-housing, which provides up to 24 months of rental assistance, financial assistance for move in costs, and supportive services; and For people who are at-risk of experiencing homelessness: homelessness prevention, which provides up to 24 months of rental assistance, utility assistance, and supportive services for people at risk of homelessness; and outreach assistance, including assistance to meet urgent needs. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, American Red Cross, and local community members have stepped up to assist survivors in Lāhainā and Upcountry Maui. HUD is working alongside to provide more assistance to the ongoing rehousing effort. RUSH funding helps to fill gaps in federal disaster assistance for people experiencing or at risk of experiencing homelessness. In addition to this RUSH allocation, HUD has provided and will continue to provide remote and on-the-ground technical assistance to the state of Hawai’i, impacted jurisdictions, and homeless assistance providers to help better serve people who have special needs, including those experiencing homelessness. Earlier today, HUD and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced that the state of Hawai’i was selected alongside seven other states and the District of Columbia to participate in the HHS-HUD Housing and Services Partnership Accelerator, a federal initiative to help states expand supportive services that help people experiencing or at-risk of homelessness transition to housing and achieve housing stability. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Friday, February 9, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_024,Biden-Harris Administration Partners with States to Address Homelessness,"Washington - The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) are announcing that eight states and the District of Columbia (DC) have been selected to participate in a new federal initiative, known as the “Housing and Services Partnership Accelerator” (Accelerator), to help strengthen partnerships across housing, disability, aging, and health sectors; access available federal programs and resources, and maximize federal flexibilities to help keep people healthy. The Accelerator will help eight states and DC unlock critical resources to reduce homelessness by addressing health-related social needs, such as housing-related services. The program provides technical assistance to states implementing HHS’ recently issued guidance regarding clinically appropriate and evidence-based services that can be covered under Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP). For example, states can support health care access through Medicaid section 1115 demonstrations that provide services like housing transition services and case management that helps people avoid lease violation. In addition, states can provide services that connect people to HUD housing programs by covering short-term housing costs, like security deposits and rental application fees, for specific transitions. “Since Day One of the Biden-Harris Administration, HUD has worked to not only expand the availability of housing assistance, but to ensure people experiencing homelessness have access to supportive services so they can permanently transition to housing,” said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “We are proud to partner with HHS and Secretary Becerra to take that work even further.” “Nobody in America should experience homelessness. Today we are taking important steps to help communities better access HHS’ programs to address homelessness and connect people with housing-related services and supports – which could be life changing,” said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra. “The Biden-Harris Administration has worked tirelessly to help people experiencing homelessness to provide needed services and supports that help them maintain that housing. We will continue to work on strengthening partnerships across housing, disability, aging, and health sectors and do everything we can to prevent and address homelessness.” The Accelerator was announced by HHS and HUD in November 2023 as a competitive technical assistance opportunity for states. States with approved federal Medicaid section 1115 demonstrations or section 1915(i) state plan amendments covering housing-related support services for people experiencing or at-risk of homelessness when clinically appropriate were eligible to apply. As part of their Accelerator application, states were asked to form collaborative teams comprised of partners from their health, housing, and aging and disability sectors, and outline the status of their implementation of Medicaid-covered housing-related services and supports, their goals under the Accelerator, and areas where technical assistance was needed. HHS and HUD received an overwhelming response with applications from fifteen eligible states and DC. A rigorous review and scoring process, including interviews with state teams, led to the final selection of the following states: Arizona California District of Columbia Hawaii Maryland Massachusetts Minnesota North Carolina Washington Over the next twelve months, HUD and HHS will provide these eight states and DC with intensive federal technical assistance and opportunities for state peer-to-peer exchange to support their implementation of clinically-indicated housing-related services and supports under their Medicaid programs for people with complex health needs experiencing or at-risk of homelessness, including people with disabilities, older adults, people with mental health disorders, people with substance use disorders, and people with other chronic medical conditions. By receiving this federal technical assistance, these states can improve coordination and delivery of services like navigation services, ongoing individualized case management, one-time transition assistance, and home modifications that can help people experiencing or at-risk of homelessness to obtain and maintain stable housing. Synopses of each state’s areas of focus and goals under the Accelerator can be found here. The Housing and Services Partnership Accelerator helps fulfill a federal commitment to “scale housing and supports that meet demand” made in All In: The Biden Administration’s Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness, which was developed by the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH) with input from stakeholders across the U.S., including people with lived experience of homelessness. Secretary Becerra serves as Chair of USICH and has made expanding supportive services to prevent and address homelessness a priority. Last week, HUD announced $3.16 billion in funding to fund 7,000 housing and services projects for people experiencing homelessness – the largest expansion of annual federal funding provided through HUD’s Continuum of Care program in history. In November 2023, HHS, through the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), published guidance and a framework clarifying the flexibilities available to states under their Medicaid section 1115 demonstrations or 1915(i) state plan amendments to cover services to help meet eligible enrollees’ health related social needs like housing and nutrition, and to receive federal matching funds for their Medicaid expenditures on those services when clinically indicated. The Accelerator will provide tailored support to the selected eight states and DC who are early adopters of these flexibilities. States not selected to participate in the Accelerator may apply to participate in a related technical assistance opportunity, the National Academy for State Health Policy’s Health and Housing Institute (HHI), funded by HHS through the Health Resources & Services Administration. Now in its third year, the HHI also supports states pursuing cross-agency and federal-state-local strategies to increase access to safe, affordable housing and wrap-around services and supports for people experiencing homelessness or housing instability. Applications for the HHI are due on February 13, 2024. Later this year, HHS, HUD, and USICH will host an in-person convening for the eight states and DC participating in the Accelerator, states that applied but were not selected for the Accelerator, states participating in the HHI, and the seven communities participating in USICH’s ALL INside initiative to address unsheltered homelessness to share and discuss their efforts to align housing, health, and supportive services to address and prevent homelessness. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

Fudge. “Working together, we can ensure that these funds reach those most in need.” Administered by the Department of Commerce’s National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), the Broadband Equity, Access and Deployment program (BEAD) provides $42.45 billion in federal grant funding to deploy reliable, affordable high-speed Internet infrastructure to everyone in America, particularly in unserved or underserved communities. All 50 states, U.S. territories, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico will receive funding to administer their own subgrant programs to build infrastructure in communities across their states. Each state and territory will run its own BEAD challenge process to solicit public feedback on the homes, small businesses, and community anchor institutions—such as school and libraries—that are deemed eligible to be connected through BEAD-funded projects. In this process, an eligible challenger (a unit of local government, nonprofit organization, or Internet service provider) may challenge a determination made by the state as to whether a location is unserved or underserved by high-speed Internet service. Service availability, as described on the FCC map, for multi-dwelling unit (MDU) housing, such as apartment buildings, may not accurately reflect whether service is available to every unit in the building. HUD encourages MDU owners and management to work with eligible challengers to ensure that their availability data are correct or to submit a challenge directly to the state if they are eligible to do so. The BEAD program provides flexibility to states and territories on how to run their challenge processes, including which types of challenges they allow. Eligible challengers should consult the state or territory’s broadband office to find out when and how challenges can be submitted. Dates for the challenge process will vary by state. Some states have begun their challenge process, others will begin soon. The window to submit a challenge is short, and can range from 14-30 days.

These grant funds may be used for infrastructure, community buildings, housing rehabilitation, land acquisition, economic development, and more to support American Indian and Alaskan Native families on Indian reservations and in other Indian areas. In June 2023, HUD made $75 million available to Tribes through the ICDBG program for community development.

"Friday, February 2, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_020,"Fact Sheet: Under the Leadership of Secretary Marcia L. Fudge, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has Delivered for Black People","February 2024 HUD has Removed some Systemic Barriers to Homeownership and Supported Approximately a Quarter of a Million Black Homeowners Buy a Home with FHA Mortgages in the Last 3 Years. Since 2021, approximately 250,000 Black, homeowners have bought a home using a Federal Housing Administration (FHA) mortgage. FHA changed the way student loan debt is calculated in FHA underwriting, so qualified people with student loan debt are not at an unfair disadvantage when seeking an FHA-insured mortgage. FHA also changed its policy so that if people demonstrate a consistent record of on-time rental payments, it can boost chances of being approved for an FHA mortgage. This change contributed to an increase in approvals, particularly for single Black women. The percentage of FHA mortgages insured to Black and Brown borrowers outpaced the overall housing market. Since 2021, FHA has helped nearly 1.8 million people purchase a home. Over 83 percent, or 1.5 million of these homeowners were first-time homebuyers. As a percentage of its business, FHA serves Black borrowers at triple the rate of the rest of the market. HUD helped over 160,000 Black homeowners Avoid Foreclosure and Stay in their Homes Since the Beginning of the Pandemic. As a result of foreclosure prevention measures that HUD put in place since the beginning of the pandemic, 160,000 Black homeowners with FHA mortgages were able to keep their homes during a time of financial distress. HUD has Expanded Access to Housing Counseling to Help Black Families and Individuals Unlock the Wealth Building Potential of Homeownership. HUD has expanded the Office of Housing Counseling and invested in improving access points to housing counselors. In addition, Secretary Fudge has hosted various HUD House Parties in Washington D.C. and around the country to connect people to homeownership and wealth building resources. Last year, HUD launched the Let's Make Home the Goal campaign to connect families and individuals to HUD-Certified housing counselors and help people set financial goals, navigate the homebuying process, and secure the keys to a home. HUD allocated nearly $1 million towards research focused on closing gaps in access to mortgage financing and homeownership. HUD has Invested in Black-owned Small Businesses and Black Developers. Since 2021, HUD has supported the government-wide priority to advance equity in federal procurement by expanding opportunities for Small Disadvantaged Businesses – including Black small businesses. HUD has significantly increased its contracting to small and disadvantaged businesses and has made funding in community block grants easily accessible to be invested in low-income communities. Secretary Fudge convened Black developers on many occasions to discuss how HUD continues to reduce barriers to accessing funds. HUD Continues to Invest in Historically Black Colleges and Universities. HUD awarded more than $10 million in funding to HBCUs across the country to conduct housing and community development research that focuses on individual and community wealth building, housing affordability and stability, climate resilience, and economic opportunity. HUD Remains Dedicated to Combating Racial Discrimination in Housing. HUD continues to work with real estate agents, appraisers, states, and communities to root out bias in the appraisal process and end the practice of “low-balling” once and for all. HUD is working on a final rule to meaningfully implement the Fair Housing Act’s Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing obligation to address significant disparities in housing needs for members of protected classes. In 2023 alone, HUD granted $30 million to fair housing organizations to fight housing discrimination. HUD has Expanded Rental Assistance and Increased the Number of Housing Choice Vouchers to People with Low Incomes. In the last three years, HUD has awarded roughly 120,000 new incremental housing vouchers – the largest increase in vouchers in 20 years. Nationally, 48 percent of voucher holders identified as Black in 2023. HUD’s Emergency Housing Vouchers, the first-ever federal housing voucher program specifically targeted to addressing homelessness, is helping to address the racial inequities in homelessness. Approximately 37 percent of people experiencing homelessness are Black and more than 46 percent of households assisted by Emergency Housing Vouchers are Black. HUD has also advanced policies to make vouchers easier to use and more widely accepted. HUD is Providing Second Chances in HUD-Assisted Housing for People Who Have Been Impacted by Prior Justice System Involvement. Secretary Fudge directed the agency to undertake a comprehensive review of HUD regulations, policies, and guidance to identify ways to reduce unnecessary and discriminatory denials and exclusions for people who have past criminal records but who pose no danger or risk to their communities. As a result of that review, HUD will amend HUD’s regulations governing housing vouchers, public housing, and HUD’s multifamily housing programs to ensure that applicants are not automatically denied simply because they have a criminal record, but instead are given a fair and full individualized review. HUD and the State of Louisiana Reached an Agreement to Free 3,300 Louisianans from ‘Road Home’ Repayment Obligations 17 years after Hurricane Katrina. In February 2023, Secretary Fudge announced the closure of the ‘Road Home’ program, which freed 3,300 Louisianans from repayment obligations following debts incurred in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. With the State’s compliance with HUD’s corrective action, the State released unpaid judgments and payment plans against homeowners in April 2023. The end of the ‘Road Home’ program was life changing for people like the Saunders family, long-time residents of New Orleans who have lived in their home for 30 years. For more than a decade, the Saunders family feared for their future because they held a ‘Road Home’ debt of $30,000 – money they used for post-Katrina housing repairs and expenses. With this agreement, the full balance of $30,000 owed was cleared by the State and the family no longer owes that debt. The Saunders looked forward to sending their nephew to college that Fall. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Monday, January 29, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_018,Biden-Harris Administration Awards $3.16 Billion in Homelessness Assistance Funding to Communities Nationwide,"Grant awards to over 7,000 projects represent the largest amount of annual federal funding provided through HUD’s Continuum of Care program in history, expanding housing and services projects for people experiencing homelessness, including survivors of domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, and sexual assault WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced nearly $3.16 billion in Continuum of Care program awards for over 7,000 projects that provide housing assistance and/or supportive services to people experiencing homelessness, as well as costs related to planning and data collection. HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge made the announcement today with the Chatham-Savannah Interagency Council on Homelessness in Savannah, Georgia. The Chatham-Savannah Continuum of Care was awarded $4,104,782. “Now, more than ever, we are doing all we can to get people off the street and into permanent homes with access to services. That is why we are making sure the service providers on the frontlines of this crisis have the resources they need,” said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “At HUD, we have served or permanently housed 1.2 million people experiencing homelessness in the last three years alone, building on President Biden’s efforts to keep Americans housed. The historic awards we are announcing today will expand community capacity to assist more people in obtaining the safety and stability of a home, along with the supports they need to achieve their life goals.” HUD’s Continuum of Care program is the backbone federal program supporting community homelessness response systems across the country, providing grants to nonprofit providers, States, Indian Tribes, and local governments for permanent and short-term housing assistance, supportive services, planning, data, and other costs. The $3.16 billion announced today represents the largest-ever amount of Continuum of Care program funding awarded to communities to address homelessness in history and provides a critical expansion of resources at a time when rates of homelessness are rising in most communities. Included in the $3.16 billion of total awards, approximately $136 million was made available for competitive and non-competitive Youth Homelessness Demonstration Program (YHDP) renewal and replacement grants. The 2023 awards also include approximately $57 million for new projects that will support housing and service needs for survivors of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. When HUD announced the availability of these grants, the agency encouraged communities to use proven solutions to address homelessness, such as approaches that first connect people to housing, often with supportive services, rather than requiring people experiencing homelessness to first complete a treatment program or achieve sobriety as a condition to accessing housing. HUD also expanded the Continuum of Care program’s eligible activities to support protections available through the Violence Against Women Act Reauthorization Act of 2022 and to address the unique challenges Continuums of Care face when serving people experiencing homelessness in rural areas. The new eligible activities will allow for greater support for underserved populations. Successful applicants demonstrated their community wide commitment to ending homelessness by highlighting local partnerships with health agencies, mainstream housing agencies, and others. Many communities are particularly focused on reducing unsheltered homelessness through a collaborative, interdisciplinary approach. Since Day One, the Biden-Harris Administration has been tackling the nation’s homelessness crisis with the urgency it requires, prioritizing new resources and programs to help communities quickly reconnect people experiencing homelessness to housing. Homelessness has risen each year since 2016, with the exception of between 2020 and 2022, when the Biden-Harris Administration’s pandemic-era protections and programs such as the scaling of additional Emergency Rental Assistance, and implementation of the enhanced Child Tax Credit and Earned Income Tax Credit prevented evictions and kept homelessness flat. The Administration has also partnered with state and local leaders across the country to support their efforts. These investments are in addition to sweeping new efforts taken by President Biden to increase housing supply, lower costs, and protect renters, including through the first-ever Housing Supply Action Plan and Blueprint for a Renters Bill of Rights. The Biden-Harris Administration continues its efforts to not only stop but reverse the post-2016 rise in homelessness, as stated in All In, The Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness, which the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH) released in December 2022. President Biden’s FY2024 Budget calls for Congress to take further action to address homelessness and keep Americans in their homes, such as commonsense investments to lower rental costs and guaranteed vouchers for low-income veterans and youth aging out of foster care, who are typically at higher risk of becoming homeless. HUD remains committed to policy priorities of ending homelessness for all persons, placing emphasis on racial equity and anti-discrimination policies for LGTBQ+ individuals, engaging persons with lived experiences of homelessness in decision-making, and increasing the supply of affordable housing.

"Thursday, January 25, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_016,HUD and Tennessee Housing Providers Reach Agreement on Disability and VAWA Noncompliance,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced today that it has entered into a Voluntary Compliance Agreement (VCA) with HUD-funded Tennessee housing providers Alco Greenbriar Partners LP, Alco Properties, Inc., and Alco Management, Inc., requiring the respondents to pay $50,000 in compensation to the aggrieved parties. The VCA resolves findings of noncompliance related to Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, as identified in a Letter of Findings of Noncompliance, as well as findings of noncompliance related to the Violence Against Women Act. Read the Agreement, Letter of Findings and the VAWA Memo. “Under the Biden-Harris Administration, we are taking on housing discrimination like never before,” said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “HUD is holding housing providers accountable, and ensuring people who face discrimination have a voice in order to build a fairer nation for all.” Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibits the exclusion or discrimination of qualified individuals based on disability in any program receiving federal financial assistance, including from HUD. Similarly, Title II of the ADA prohibits disability discrimination. The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) strengthens housing protections for survivors of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. VAWA applies to individuals seeking assistance under covered HUD housing programs, authorizing HUD to enforce the law with the same process, rights, and remedies as the Fair Housing Act. The Letter of Findings of Noncompliance described the respondents’ effective denial of multiple reasonable accommodation or modification requests. HUD also uncovered instances of VAWA noncompliance involving two households that experienced incidents of sexual assault and/or domestic violence and in which the respondents failed to provide the requested VAWA transfers or take any additional action needed to process the requests. “Housing providers who receive federal assistance are required to ensure equal opportunity in housing for all the residents they serve,” said Demetria L. McCain, HUD’s Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. “HUD is committed to using all its tools, including compliance reviews, to ensure housing providers meet their obligations under federal law. We remain committed to rooting out discrimination in housing, including discrimination against individuals with disabilities and survivors covered under VAWA.” The Agreement stems from a limited compliance review initiated by HUD in November 2022 under Section 504 for Greenbriar Apartments, a 208-unit development in Tennessee owned by Alco Greenbriar Partners, LP (Greenbriar), whose general partner is Alco Properties, Inc. The property is managed by Alco Management, Inc., which manages over 50 multifamily properties throughout the Southeast. The property receives Project Based Rental Assistance through HUD Multifamily Housing. Following the limited compliance review, the Letter of Findings of Noncompliance was issued in April 2023, describing the respondents’ effective denial of multiple reasonable accommodation or modification requests. The recipient expressed an unwillingness to transfer residents from one Alco property to another when a vacancy that met the need of the requesting tenant was unavailable at Greenbriar. HUD also found that 5% of the units were not accessible to individuals with mobility impairments, and an additional 2% of the units were not accessible to individuals with hearing or vision impairments. Although VAWA was not within the scope of the compliance review, HUD uncovered instances of VAWA noncompliance involving two households that experienced incidents of sexual assault and/or domestic violence. Two tenants requested VAWA emergency transfers and in both instances, the recipients failed to provide the transfer or take any additional action needed to process the requests. Due to the egregiousness of the respondents’ lack of action and the amount of time that had lapsed since the tenants’ initial requests, the compliance review team addressed the VAWA issues in a separate memorandum to the recipient. The respondents voluntarily accepted the Department’s invitation to enter negotiations to identify corrective actions that would resolve all the findings and concerns identified during the compliance review. A VCA to resolve the Section 504 findings and VAWA issues was executed on November 10, 2023. Under the VCA, the respondents agreed to $50,000 in monetary compensation for the five (5) aggrieved parties named in the Letter of Findings and VAWA memorandum. The respondents will also amend its reasonable accommodation transfer log, revise the transfer policy, revise its VAWA policies, construct or convert ten (10) UFAS-accessible units, with an additional four (4) units for the hearing and visually impaired and accessible common areas, designate a VAWA Coordinator, respond to VAWA-related grievances and transfer requests within ten (10) days, and attend VAWA training. Individuals who believe they have experienced discrimination in housing may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 877-8339 (Federal Relay Service). Housing providers can learn more about their responsibility to provide reasonable accommodations and reasonable modifications to individuals with disabilities here.

"Thursday, January 25, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_015,HUD and Census Bureau Report New Residential Sales in December 2023,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Census Bureau jointly announced the following new residential sales statistics for December 2023: New Home Sales Sales of new single‐family houses in December 2023 were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 664,000, according to estimates released jointly today by the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. This is 8.0 percent (±24.2 percent)* above the revised November rate of 615,000 and is 4.4 percent (±20.6 percent)* above the December 2022 estimate of 636,000. An estimated 668,000 new homes were sold in 2023. This is 4.2 percent (±5.2 percent)* above the 2022 figure of 641,000. Sales Price The median sales price of new houses sold in December 2023 was $413,200. The average sales price was $487,300. For Sale Inventory and Months’ Supply The seasonally‐adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of December was 453,000. This represents a supply of 8.2 months at the current sales rate. The January report is scheduled for release on February 26, 2024.View the full schedule in the Economic Briefing Room: www.census.gov/economic‐indicators/. The full text and tables for this release can be found at www.census.gov/construction/nrs/. EXPLANATORY NOTES These statistics are estimated from sample surveys. They are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated average relative standard errors of the preliminary data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as “2.5 percent (±3.2%) above” appears in the text, this indicates the range (‐0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90‐percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. Changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show irregular movement. It takes 4 months to establish a trend for new houses sold. Preliminary new home sales figures are subject to revision due to the survey methodology and definitions used. The survey is primarily based on a sample of houses selected from building permits. Since a “sale” is defined as a deposit taken or sales agreement signed, this can occur prior to a permit being issued. An estimate of these prior sales is included in the sales figure. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimate of total sales is revised about 5.4 percent. Changes in sales price data reflect changes in the distribution of houses by region, size, etc., as well as changes in the prices of houses with identical characteristics. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at the Census Bureau’s website. * The 90 percent confidence interval includes zero. In such cases, there is insufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero. ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.

"Thursday, January 25, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_014,"HUD, DOE, EPA Sign Joint Letter Asking Utility Companies to Make Energy and Water Usage Data Available for Multifamily Properties","WASHINGTON - Today, the leaders of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced a joint letter asking for the nation’s leading utility companies to make energy and water use data freely available to the owners of multifamily properties to eliminate barriers to energy efficiency improvements for families who live in multifamily assisted housing. “Thanks to the President’s Inflation Reduction Act, we are investing billions in much-needed energy efficiency upgrades at the properties where many of our most vulnerable populations call home,” said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “In order to do that, we need to provide the properties we serve with accurate data. Today, we join the DOE and EPA to ask utility companies to help us by making information available on energy and water usage for all.” “Through President Biden’s Investing in America agenda, DOE’s Home Energy Rebates will help American households save nearly a billion dollars annually on their energy bills by making it easier to install upgrades like insulation or new electric Energy Star appliances,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. “We are proud to join HUD and EPA to call for utility companies to provide accurate usage data and maximize the ability for all households – including renters – to live in more comfortable, energy efficient homes.” “Under President Biden’s leadership, we’re seeing a historic transition to clean energy across the entire economy. Thanks to leaders like Secretary Fudge and Secretary Granholm, this transition includes our nation’s housing, leading to a reduction in household pollution and resulting in significant cost savings for families,” said EPA Administrator Michael S. Regan. “There’s more work to be done, especially for the communities that have been left behind for far too long. This joint effort will provide improved critical energy data, creating brighter, more efficient homes, and further reducing costs, ensuring we can build a sustainable future for all.” Multifamily properties are home to more than 19 million low-income households – over 15 percent of all U.S. households. Upgrades to these properties targeting utility conservation could significantly reduce energy and water costs. Under the Inflation Reduction Act, the Biden-Harris Administration delivered more than $6.6 billion in funding for U.S. multifamily properties to improve energy and water efficiency and lower costs. This includes programs like HUD’s Green and Resilient Retrofit Program (GRRP) and DOE’s Home Efficiency Rebate Program. To maximize the impact of these investments, owners of multifamily properties need access to complete energy use data for their buildings – data that many utility companies currently fail to share. EPA offers Guidance for Utilities on Providing Whole-Building Energy Data, as well as one-on-one support to utilities interested in making this data available to owners. By championing the availability of whole-building utility data access, utility companies will facilitate cost-effective investments in the communities they serve.

"Tuesday, January 23, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_013,HUD Charges Montana Property Manager and Apartment Complex Owner with Retaliation,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today it is charging an individual property manager and ownership entity in Livingston, Montana, for retaliation against a tenant for their exercise of fair housing rights, retaliatory behavior including coercion, intimidation, threats, or interference in violation of Section 818 of the Fair Housing Act. Read HUD’s Charge. The Fair Housing Act prohibits retaliation for exercising fair housing rights, as well as coercing, intimidating, threatening, or interfering with someone’s exercise of those rights. “The abhorrent conduct alleged in this case violates the Fair Housing Act,” said Demetria L. McCain, HUD’s Principal Assistant Deputy Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. “Tenants should not live in fear of retaliation, or any kind of discrimination protected by the Act. Today’s action sends a clear message that HUD will hold housing providers accountable when they violate the law.” HUD’s Charge of Discrimination alleges that the property manager and owner of a Livingston, Montana, ten-unit apartment complex retaliated against a tenant after the tenant informed the property manager that his unwanted conduct toward her daughter was inappropriate given the property manager’s position as landlord. After the tenant confronted the property manager, the property manager took several retaliatory actions, including sending multiple threats of eviction, revoking tenancy privileges, and sending harassing text messages, culminating in seeking to evict the complainant. The tenant felt compelled to leave the unit and seek out alternative, less desirable housing because of the retaliation. “The deplorable conduct alleged in this case constitutes retaliation that violates the Fair Housing Act,” said Damon Smith, HUD’s General Counsel. “HUD is steadfastly committed to protecting the rights of tenants to be free from such retaliation by landlords.” A United States Administrative Law Judge will hear HUD’s charge unless any party elects to have the case heard in Federal district court. If the Administrative Law Judge finds, after a hearing, that discrimination has occurred, the judge may award damages to the resident for his losses as a result of the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief to deter further discrimination and payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties to vindicate the public interest. If the Federal court hears the case, the Judge may also award punitive damages to the resident. People who believe they are the victims of housing discrimination should contact HUD at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY).

WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced Wisconsin’s Healthy Housing Initiatives Portfolio (WHHIP) as the winner of the 2023 HUD Secretary’s Award for Excellence in Healthy Homes. Healthy housing is the foundation for strong, vibrant communities and their residents. The award offers an exceptional opportunity to recognize the program or project best creating and sustaining healthier home environments. “Wisconsin’s Healthy Homes Initiatives Portfolio improved the lives of children with asthma and those threatened by lead exposure in Wisconsin,” said Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “Through collaboration, evidence-based policy, and strong commitment to sustainability, this project stood out in a large group of worthy nominations.” WHHIP, a project within Wisconsin’s Bureau of Environmental and Occupational Health developed and launched initiatives to decrease residential lead paint hazards for at-risk populations and implement in-home asthma education and low-cost home modifications in the homes of Wisconsin children. For the first time, HUD chose to give the Secretary’s Award to a single organization. This award recognizes a project or program that has made extraordinary impacts in their locality through innovative solutions which are replicable with quantifiable health, economic, and/or societal outcomes. Established in 2015, the Award highlights innovative approaches, best practices, policies, research, and community engagement that make significant contributions to reduce exposure to health risks, environmental hazards, and substandard housing, especially in resource-limited communities.

"Thursday, January 11, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_007,HUD Strengthens Commitment to Public Health with New Radon Policy and $3 Million in Grants for Testing and Mitigation,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today the publication of its Departmental Policy for addressing Radon in the Environmental Review Process. With this policy, HUD increases its commitment to radon awareness and the importance of addressing the risk of residential radon exposure. HUD is requiring that radon be considered as part of the HUD environmental review process. Radon is the number one cause of lung cancer in non-smokers and is responsible for about 21,000 lung cancer deaths every year. By requiring that radon be considered within the HUD environmental review process, HUD is committed to addressing the hazard of this serious contaminant. “Through this new policy, HUD will increase awareness and address the hazards posed by radon to the health and safety of families across America,” said Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “These grants will help public housing agencies reduce the threats presented by radon exposure to families and children.” HUD’s policy requires consideration of radon when appropriate and encourages the testing of radon as the most effective means by which site-specific levels of radon can be identified, though the policy does not require testing. This policy serves as an initial step toward advancing radon awareness and mitigation of the hazard in HUD-assisted housing nationwide. The policy applies to environmental reviews for all HUD programs subject to HUD’s environmental review regulations at 24 CFR Parts 50 and 58. The policy goes into effect 90 days after publication for all non-tribal recipients. For all Tribe, Tribally Designated Housing Entity, and Department of Hawaiian Homeland recipients, the policy goes into effect two years after publication. Today, HUD also awarded over $3 million to public housing agencies in six states to protect children and families from radon hazards. HUD is providing these grants through its Radon Testing and Mitigation Demonstration Grant Program to public housing agencies to conduct testing and as needed mitigation of radon in the units that they manage. The program also supports the housing authorities’ developing plans for future testing and mitigation. This investment will protect about 3,000 residents, including children, from risks posed by radon exposure. Read a complete description of the projects awarded grants today.

WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the Federal Register to update regulations for the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and Indian Community Development Block Grant Programs (ICDBG). The proposed rule would streamline program requirements, promote economic development and investments in underserved communities, and enable larger, transformative construction projects such as housing rehabilitation, mixed-use development, and infrastructure improvements. “From coast to coast and nearly everywhere in between, Community Development Block Grant funds build roads and sewers, rehabilitate homes, support nonprofit organizations and small businesses, and help communities prepare for and recovery from weather related disasters,” said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. “The Biden-Harris Administration has committed to making federal programs easier to use, and this rule will reduce burden on grantees and ensure this critical funding reaches communities quickly.” These updates would improve the ability of CDBG grantees to implement funding more effectively and efficiently – making it easier for States and localities to use CDBG or Section 108 Loan Guarantee funding to invest in underserved areas. Section 108 allows communities to access up to five times their annual CDBG allocation via low interest loans for eligible activities and is a valuable tool in spurring economic development and job creation. Additionally, if promulgated, the proposed rule would strengthen provisions related to Consolidated Plan, public participation requirements, and the timely expenditure of CDBG funding. HUD is also proposing corresponding technical changes to ICDBG program regulations to better align CDBG and ICDBG. HUD intends to publish another ICDBG proposed rule soon, substantially changing the ICDBG program regulations following further Tribal consultation. Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary Marion McFadden added: “For fifty years, CDBG has been a reliable resource for communities across the country. CDBG’s annual formula grant provides flexible funding for States and localities to address their greatest needs.” The proposed revisions to the CDBG regulations would be the first substantial regulatory update since 1995. If finalized, this proposed rule would be a significant step to modernizing and strengthening the programs to allow funds to flow more quickly to economically distressed communities. The proposed updates also aim to improve data collection to measure effectiveness and program outcomes. HUD seeks public comment on this proposed rule and invites all interested parties and members of the public to submit their views, comments, and recommendations for improvement for this proposal. Comments may be submitted electronically through www.regulations.gov, or through the methods described in the proposed rule. CDBG is a formula grant program which provides funding to all fifty states and over 1,200 localities – primarily benefiting people of modest means. ICDBG is a competitive grant program available to Tribes. Further information regarding CDBG is available at www.hud.gov/program_offices/comm_planning/cdbg.

Since the start of the Biden-Harris Administration, FHA has supported nearly 1.8 million homeowners with purchase mortgages, and 83.6 percent or 1.5 million of whom are first-time homebuyers. Under the Biden-Harris Administration, FHA continues to provide outsized support to historically underserved borrowers. This past year alone, more than four out of every five borrowers with FHA-insured mortgages are first-time homebuyers, while in the market, fewer than half of mortgages are made to first-time homebuyers. The percentage of FHA’s volume comprised of mortgages made to Black borrowers was triple the rate of the rest of the market, and for Hispanic borrowers it was double. According to calendar year 2022 data, close to half of all rural homebuyers who obtained low down-payment mortgages obtained mortgages insured by FHA.

"Monday, January 8, 2024",https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_24_001,HUD Announces Agreement with Affordable Rental Housing Provider to Increase Housing Opportunity,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has entered a Voluntary Compliance Agreement for Shore Hill Apartments resolving a compliance review concerning non-discrimination in marketing and tenanting procedures. Shore Hill Apartments is a 558-unit multifamily property comprised of studio and one-bedroom units in Brooklyn, New York. The property provides affordable subsidized units through the Section 8 program for families with a member who is 62 or older or has a disability, including otherwise qualified families with children. Read the Agreement. HUD enforces the Fair Housing Act, which prohibits discrimination because of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, and disability. HUD also enforces other federal civil rights laws, including Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin in programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance. “Restrictive occupancy policies can limit housing opportunities for families in a manner that is discriminatory,” said Demetria L. McCain, HUD’s Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. “HUD is committed to ensuring that every eligible applicant has a meaningful opportunity to participate in HUD funded housing programs.” This Agreement arises from a compliance review that was conducted by HUD’s Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity (FHEO) under Title VI and Section 504. FHEO opened the review based on information indicating disproportionately low participation rates of Black and Hispanic residents relative to the housing market area over decades, extending to prior owners of the property. The review sought to ensure eligible persons were not discriminated against in opportunities to learn about, apply to, and reside in HUD subsidized housing on the basis of race, color or national origin. In particular, the review revealed the property’s occupancy standard restricted occupancy of studio units to a family size of one and one-bedroom units to a family size of two, contributing to denials based on race and deterring families as small as two persons from applying to the property. FHEO expanded the review to include Section 504 when the investigation revealed the property had a practice of denying families with heads of households under 62 years of age, without considering whether the household was otherwise eligible to apply to and reside in the property on the basis of disability. The Agreement provides a fund in the amount of $510,000 to compensate individuals who were either denied due to the restrictive occupancy policy, or individuals with disabilities who were improperly denied housing. In addition, the Agreement requires creation of a new waitlist after robust marketing to those least likely to apply, committing a minimum of $10,000 towards advertising, outreach, and website development; affirmative agreement not to adopt an elderly preference and to consider equally for tenancy otherwise qualified applicants with disabilities and applicants aged 62 or over; and revising the property’s occupancy policy to be no more restrictive than local ordinance. This Agreement does not constitute admissions by the housing providers or evidence of a final determination by HUD of violations of Title VI, Section 504, or any other laws. Individuals who believe they have experienced discrimination in housing may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 877-8339 (Federal Relay Service). ### HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.
