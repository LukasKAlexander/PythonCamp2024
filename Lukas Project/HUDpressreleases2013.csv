01/02/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-001.cfm,HUD Announces Agreement with Bank of America to Settle LGBT Discrimination Claim,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today announced an agreement with Bank of America (BOA) to settle a claim that the mortgage lender refused to provide financing to a lesbian couple. The agreement is the first enforcement action taken against a lender involving HUD's recent rule ensuring that the Department's core housing programs be open to all eligible persons, regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital status.
HUD's rule, Equal Access to Housing in HUD Programs Regardless of Sexual Orientation or Gender Identity prohibits lenders from basing eligibility determinations for mortgage loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) on actual or perceived sexual orientation, gender identity or marital status. HUD's Equal Access rule applies to all housing programs administered by the Department.
""This agreement demonstrates that HUD will vigorously enforce its Equal Access rule and pursue lenders that discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity or marital status,"" said Helen Kanovsky, HUD's General Counsel. ""By the same token, BOA should be commended for stepping up and taking immediate corrective action after HUD notified BOA of the violation.""
John Trasviña, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, added, ""The HUD Equal Access Rule means just what it says: one's sexual orientation, gender identity or marital status is not a legitimate basis on which to deny a mortgage. Members of the housing industry should take note of this settlement agreement. HUD will enforce its regulations to make sure its programs are truly open to all qualified families.""
HUD claimed BOA denied a loan to a Florida couple seeking to obtain an FHA-insured mortgage because of their sexual orientation and marital status. Because one partner was not employed, the applicant enlisted her partner's mother as a co-applicant on the loan. The couple worked with BOA for several weeks to provide all of the necessary loan application documents and the couple was assured by BOA that they were likely to receive a mortgage. One business day prior to closing, BOA denied the mortgage because it did not consider the loan applicant and the co-applicant directly related because the applicant and her partner were not married. As a result of BOA's actions, the couple was not able to close on the loan.
Under the terms of the agreement, BOA agrees to pay HUD $7,500 and to notify its residential mortgage loan originators, processors and underwriters of its Settlement Agreement with HUD. In addition, BOA will remind its employees that they are prohibited from discriminating against FHA-loan applicants on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity or marital status. BOA will also update its fair lending training program to include information on HUD's rule.
If you believe you have experienced housing discrimination, you should contact HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity for help at (800) 669-9777. You may also file a housing discrimination complaint online. Additionally you should contact your local HUD office for assistance regarding alleged violations of HUD programs regulations."
01/03/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-002.cfm,HUD and Census Bureau Expand Access to Detailed Information on Nation's Housing,"WASHINGTON - Nearly 20 percent of recent movers identified ""convenience to job"" as the most important factor in their choice of neighborhood in 2011, according to the 2011 American Housing Survey (AHS), the definitive source of information on the quality of housing in the United States. For the first time ever, the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development have made survey results available on the Census Bureau's American FactFinder (http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml?refresh=t) data access tool.
A wide range of specific topics is covered in the survey, including plumbing and source of water and sewage disposal; housing problems; householder's satisfaction with home and neighborhood; value, purchase price and type of mortgage; recent home improvement activity and costs; safety features and potential health hazards; features in home providing accessibility to people with disabilities; and socio-economic characteristics of the householder. Statistics are national-level only and are provided for apartments, single-family homes, manufactured housing, new construction and vacant housing units.
Topics new to the housing survey include safety features, potential health hazards and features providing accessibility to people with disabilities. Among the accessibility features in occupied homes were floors with no steps between rooms (64 percent of homes have this feature), entry level bathrooms (48 percent), entry level bedrooms (36 percent) and handles or levers on sinks (28 percent). The least common accessibility features were elevators (found in 0.2 percent of homes), ramps (1 percent), handrails or grab bars (excluding steps) in nonbathroom areas (2 percent), raised toilets (7 percent) and built-in shower seats (8 percent).
Other highlights on the nation's 115 million occupied homes:
The median year these homes were built was 1974, with owner-occupied units being slightly newer (1976 compared with 1972 for renter-occupied). The median size of single-family detached and mobile home units is 1,800 square feet, with owner-occupied units being larger (1,800 square feet) than renter-occupied ones (1,300 square feet). Newly constructed units are also usually larger, with a median size of 2,200 square feet. Most homes have three or more bedrooms (64 percent). New homes (those built in the last four years) generally have more bedrooms, with 74 percent of them having three or more. About half the homes (52 percent) have two or more bathrooms. Again, new units have more bathrooms, with 83 percent of them having two or more. More than eight in 10 units have a washing machine (83 percent) and clothes dryer (81 percent). About two-thirds of the units (66 percent) have central air-conditioning and another 22 percent have window units – new units are more likely to have central air-conditioning (87 percent). The most common Energy Star-rated appliances found in housing units are refrigerators (35 percent), washing machines (30 percent) and dishwashers (22 percent). Energy Star refers to an international energy efficiency rating. About seven in 10 respondents (71 percent) rate their homes highly (ratings of eight to 10) with 29 percent giving them the ""best"" rating of 10. Residents of new construction tend to rate their homes even more highly with 84 percent giving them a rating between eight and 10 and 46 percent rating them as a 10. Recent movers were also asked how they found their current units. The most common methods for home owners were talking with a real estate agent (20 percent), Realtor.com (17 percent) and word of mouth (16 percent). For renters, the most common ways included word of mouth (34 percent), sign on the outside of the building (11 percent) and Craigslist (11 percent). On average, households pay $927 per month, or 24 percent of their household income, for housing. The cost is higher for residents of new construction, with median cost being $1,340 per month or 24 percent of household income. Renters generally pay less in housing cost ($845 versus $1,008 for owners per month), but they usually pay a higher percentage of their household income (31 percent versus 20 percent for owners). More than a fifth (21 percent) of all primary mortgage holders reported a change in their monthly payment in the last 12 months. The main reason for their payment change was because of a change in property taxes or homeowners insurance (71 percent). Twelve percent of households reported a smoker living in the unit. Sixteen percent of units reported having a swimming pool. Mold was reported in 4 percent of housing units. Respondents most commonly reported mold sighting in their bathrooms (45 percent), bedrooms (22 percent) and basements (20 percent). In 2011, owners spent a median of $33 on routine maintenance. Of the 43,740 owned homes in which a home improvement had been made in the last two years, 35 percent replaced or added an appliance or some type of major equipment, 19 percent replaced or added plumbing fixtures and 17 percent replaced or added a heating and air-conditioning system. The cost of an average kitchen remodel was $5,000. Adding or renovating a kitchen, however, was much more expensive ($27,353). The average bathroom cost $2,432 to remodel, with renovations or additions costing an average of $3,422.

01/10/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-003.cfm,"HUD Launches Groundbreaking Rental Assistance Demonstration to Preserve and Strengthen Public, Other HUD-Assisted Housing","WASHINGTON - To stem the loss of critically needed public and other forms of subsidized housing as a result of the severe backlog of capital needs, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today officially launched its Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD), the Obama Administration's groundbreaking strategy to preserve tens of thousands of public and HUD-assisted housing units.
In the near term, RAD is expected to preserve and enhance more than 13,000 units of affordable housing and generate more than $650 million in private capital to address the estimated $26 billion backlog in capital needs faced by public housing authorities in the U.S. This additional capital will also stimulate employment in the construction trades across the country.
""This innovative and cost-effective approach greatly enhances our ability to confront the decline of our public housing and older assisted housing stock,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""With the initial implementation of RAD, the Obama Administration has begun to demonstrate that public-private partnership can help preserve our nation's affordable housing and create jobs in the process.""
HUD awarded 112 initial commitments to 68 public housing authorities (PHAs), allowing these local housing agencies to seek private financing to rehabilitate units that are otherwise at risk of being lost from the affordable housing inventory. In addition, HUD approved 11 requests from private owners of assisted housing projects to convert and extend rental assistance contracts for 1,100 units (see attached list of private developments). Combined, the commitments announced today are projected to preserve more than 13,000 public and other HUD-assisted housing units for the next 20 years.
RAD allows public housing agencies and private owners of certain at-risk, federally assisted properties to convert their current assistance to long-term Section 8 contracts. Such contracts will allow owners to leverage millions of dollars in debt and equity to better address immediate capital needs and preserve these affordable housing units. In addition, participating agencies are freed from antiquated public housing rules and restrictions that hindered their ability to best preserve and manage their housing similar to other affordable housing owners and managers.
In 2011, HUD released Capital Needs in the Public Housing Program, a study that found the nation's 1.2 million public housing units need $26 billion to keep these homes in safe and decent condition for families, a figure well in excess of the roughly $2 billion Congress appropriates for capital repairs annually. Beyond the potential loss of this public housing stock, the Moderate Rehabilitation, Rent Supplement, and older Rental Assistance Payment (RAP) programs are also at risk of being lost from the affordable housing stock.
RAD is part of the Obama Administration's comprehensive strategy to preserve public and HUD-assisted housing. In November 2011, Congress authorized HUD to implement RAD as a budget-neutral demonstration program with two components, allowing for the conversion of assistance for both public housing and HUD-assisted properties that have expiring subsidies."
01/11/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-004.cfm,Cyndi Lauper Joins HUD to Spotlight Local Efforts to End Homelessness Through One-Night Homeless Counts,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and Grammy Award-winning singer and songwriter Cyndi Lauper are joining the effort to ""Make Everyone Count (https://www.onecpd.info/news/2013-point-in-time-count-make-everyone-count/),"" a national campaign to support local one-night counts of homeless persons and families. Cyndi Lauper and the True Colors Fund's Forty to None Project produced a national public service announcement to encourage viewers to contribute their time to gather needed data on the scale of homelessness throughout the U.S.
During the last 10 days in January, HUD asks more than 3,000 cities and counties to conduct ""Point-in-Time"" counts of homeless persons that reveal the number of persons in shelters and on the streets on a given night. Ultimately, these one-night counts provide local planners with data they need to understand the number and characteristics of persons who are homeless so they, in turn, can develop a thoughtful response to confront homelessness.
""We're thrilled to have Cyndi join us in this national campaign to expand our understanding of homelessness and to accomplish that, we need people power,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""You can't solve a problem without understanding it. President Obama has set an ambitious goal to end homelessness as we know it and this effort is critical toward reaching this goal.""
Lauper, co-founder of the True Colors Fund, said, ""The True Colors Fund is proud to work with HUD through our Forty to None Project to raise awareness about the important count of homeless people that occurs every January. Every day across America, people struggle to overcome homelessness and we as a society need to join together to ensure that we do all that we can to help them. The first step in being able to do that is to understand how many people are actually in need. I encourage everyone to get involved and be a part of this important effort so that we can make sure that everyone counts.""
This year, volunteers will collect more detailed information about their local homeless populations including more precise age data, the number of homeless children in families, and even the gender of homeless veterans. In an effort to better count and serve homeless youth, HUD changed its data collection requirements for 2013 to better identify homeless children and youth. Additionally, HUD is engaged with the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Education in a special nine-city initiative called Youth Count! (www.usich.gov/population/youth/a_framework_for_ending_youth_homelessness_2012/youth_count/) to evaluate best practices for counting homeless youth.
In the joint public service announcement, Lauper describes why the HUD's Annual Point-in-Time count is a vital step towards better serving our homeless population and ultimately ending homelessness once and for all. Visit HUD's website (https://www.onecpd.info/news/2013-point-in-time-count-make-everyone-count/) or www.fortytonone.org to learn more about how you can help. In addition, interested people can also participate in an ongoing Twitter conversation #EveryoneCounts."

Data continue to show important progress across many key indicators with the housing marketing bottoming out nationally and clearly turning a corner - as home values continue to rise and home sales remained strong in November - although officials caution that the overall recovery remains fragile. The full Housing Scorecard is available online at www.hud.gov/scorecard.
""As the December housing scorecard indicates, our housing market is continuing to show important signs of recovery - with the FHFA and Case-Shiller housing price indices up 5.6 percent and 4.3 percent, respectively, from one year ago,"" said HUD Senior Advisor on Housing Finance Michael Berman.
""The Administration's programs to prevent foreclosure have helped millions of families stay in their homes and prompted critical changes in the way the mortgage industry assists struggling homeowners, which have helped our country recover faster from an unprecedented housing crisis,"" said Treasury Assistant Secretary for Financial Stability Tim Massad.
The December Housing Scorecard features key data on the health of the housing market and the impact of the Administration's foreclosure prevention programs, including:
Home prices showed large annual gains for the 12 months ending October 2012 and the Administration's recovery efforts continue to help millions of families deal with the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. More than six million mortgage modification and other forms of assistance arrangements were started between April 2009 and the end of November 2012. More than 81,000 loans were refinanced under the Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP) in October, bringing the total to 790,600 since the beginning of 2012.

01/16/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-006.cfm,HUD and Virginia Property Management Company Settle Allegations the Company Denied Opportunities to Non-English Speakers,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that Virginia Realty Company of Tidewater, Inc., a property management company based in Virginia Beach, VA, will pay $82,500 to settle allegations that it refused to allow a Hispanic woman to apply for an apartment because she did not speak fluent English. Virginia Realty had a policy of not renting to persons with limited English proficiency.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in the rental of housing on the basis of national origin.
""Denying housing because a person does not speak English well violates the Fair Housing Act,"" said John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""This settlement reaffirms HUD's commitment to combating discrimination against a person because of their national origin or the language they speak.""
The case came to HUD's attention when a Hispanic woman filed a complaint alleging that Virginia Realty, a property management company that manages over 500 rental units throughout Virginia Beach and Norfolk, refused to provide her a rental application because she could not speak English well and refused the translation assistance of the bilingual person she brought with her. Based on her experience, HUD launched a Secretary-initiated Investigation to determine whether the alleged discrimination was systemic. In the course of the investigation, HUD discovered that Virginia Realty had a written policy expressly requiring all prospective tenants to be able to communicate with management staff in English without assistance from others, and to complete rental applications only while they were in the management office.
As a result of HUD's investigation, Virginia Realty entered into two agreements: one with the individual who brought the initial complaint and the other with HUD. Under the first agreement, Virginia Realty will pay the prospective tenant $7,500. Under the second agreement, the company will donate $25,000 each to the Piedmont Housing Alliance, Hampton Roads Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, and Nueva Vida (New Life) Outreach International Church to support fair housing initiatives. In addition, Virginia Realty will adopt a non-discrimination policy, which it will distribute to current residents and prospective tenants; adopt a plan to more effectively serve Limited English Proficient residents and prospective tenants by providing translation and inter-pretation services; and require its employees to undergo fair housing training.
HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, with its partners in the Fair Housing Assistance Program, investigates almost 10,000 housing discrimination complaints annually. People who believe they have experienced or witnessed unlawful housing discrimination should contact HUD at (800) 669-9777 (voice), or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). More information about fair housing rights is available at HUD's website, www.hud.gov/fairhousing."
01/23/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-008.cfm,"HUD, US Bank Settle Disability Discrimination Claim","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that Bloomington, Minnesota-based U.S. Bank National Association will pay $12,000 to a loan applicant with disabilities under a Conciliation Agreement settling allegations that the bank required him to provide unnecessary documentation to establish he would continue receiving disability income for three years before they would approve his mortgage loan.
The Fair Housing Act makes it illegal to discriminate in the terms and conditions of a loan based on a person's disability, including by imposing different loan application or qualification criteria.
""Holding persons with disabilities to a different standard because they rely on disability-related income violates the Fair Housing Act,"" said John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Reasonable income standards are a necessary part of the underwriting process but HUD will continue to take action when these practices are discriminatory.""
A Roseville, Minnesota man filed a complaint with HUD alleging U.S. Bank asked him to provide proof that his disability income, including Social Security Supplemental Security Income (SSI), would continue for three years. The applicant submitted documentation from the Social Security Administration as part of his mortgage application. Additional documentation was not needed because Social Security award letters without expiration dates establish continuity of income for three years.
Under the terms of the Conciliation Agreement, U.S. Bank agreed to pay the man $12,000, accept SSI award letters as establishing at least three years' income, and refrain from requiring applicants receiving disability income to provide doctors' statements concerning the nature, severity, or duration of a disability."
01/25/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-009.cfm,HUD and New Hampshire Real Estate Agency Settle Housing Discrimination Claim,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that Scott Walker and his company Premiere Real Estate, LLC, in Concord, New Hampshire, have agreed to pay $9,000 to settle allegations that they refused to rent to families with children in violation of the Fair Housing Act.
""The days of 'no children allowed' are long over,"" said John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""For 25 years, the federal Fair Housing Act has guaranteed families with children the same rights to housing as those without children, and HUD will continue to take swift enforcement action against individuals and housing providers who violate those rights.""
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing discrimination based on familial status, including denying housing to families because they have children under the age of 18.
HUD issued a charge of discrimination after a single mother with a 14-year-old child filed a complaint alleging that Walker and Premiere Real Estate refused her request to rent a two-bedroom apartment. The apartment is on the second floor of a two-unit building. Walker uses the first floor unit as his office. HUD's charge asserted that when the woman inquired about the unit, Walker informed her that families with children didn't work out in the past because his business is below the rental unit. Walker and Premiere Real Estate allegedly screened applicants and showed available apartments only to persons who did not have children.
Under the terms of the Consent Order, Scott Walker and Premiere Real Estate LLC agreed to pay $3,000 to the single mother and a $5,000 civil penalty to the government. In addition, they will pay $1,000 to three other victims affected by the company's rental policy. Walker also agreed to take steps to market his apartments to families with children."

""These are essential and appropriate measures to manage and protect FHA's single-family insurance programs"" said Galante. ""In addition to protecting the MMI Fund, these changes will encourage the return of private capital to the housing market, and make sure FHA remains a vital source of affordable and sustainable mortgage financing for future generations of American homebuyers.""
Home Equity Conversion Mortgage Consolidation
As discussed in its Annual Report to Congress, FHA will consolidate its Standard Fixed-Rate Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) and Saver Fixed Rate HECM pricing options. This change will be effective for FHA case numbers assigned on or after April 1, 2013. The Fixed Rate Standard HECM pricing option currently represents a large majority of the loans insured through FHA's HECM program and is responsible for placing significant stress on the MMI Fund. To help sustain the program as a viable financial resource for aging homeowners, the HECM Fixed Rate Saver will be the only pricing option available to borrowers who seek a fixed interest rate mortgage. Using the HECM Fixed Rate Saver for fixed rate mortgages will significantly lower the borrower's upfront closing costs while permitting a smaller pay out than the HECM Fixed Rate Standard product, thereby reducing risks to the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund. Read FHA's new HECM Mortgagee Letter on HUD's website.
In addition to the HECM consolidation announced today, FHA will announce the following changes in the coming days:
Changes to Mortgage Insurance Premiums
FHA will increase its annual mortgage insurance premium (MIP) for most new mortgages by 10 basis points or by 0.10 percent. FHA will increase premiums on jumbo mortgages ($625,500 or larger) by 5 basis points or 0.05 percent, to the maximum authorized annual mortgage insurance premium. These premium increases exclude certain streamline refinance transactions.
FHA will also require most FHA borrowers to continue paying annual premiums for the life of their mortgage loan. Commencing in 2001, FHA cancelled required MIP on loans when the outstanding principal balance reached 78 percent of the original principal balance. However, FHA remains responsible for insuring 100 percent of the outstanding loan balance throughout the entire life of the loan, a term which often extends far beyond the cessation of these MIP payments. FHA's Office of Risk Management and Regulatory Affairs estimates that the MMI Fund has foregone billions of dollars in premium revenue on mortgages endorsed from 2010 through 2012 because of this automatic cancellation policy. Therefore, FHA will once again collect premiums based upon the unpaid principal balance for the entire period for which FHA is entitled. This will permit FHA to retain significant revenue that is currently being forfeited prematurely. Read FHA's new MIP Mortgagee Letter on HUD's website.
Requiring Manual Underwriting on Loans with Decision Credit Scores below 620 & DTI Ratios over 43 Percent
FHA will require lenders to manually underwrite loans for which borrowers have a decision credit score below 620 and a total debt-to-income (DTI) ratio greater than 43 percent. Lenders will be required to document compensating factors that support the underwriting decision to approve loans where these parameters are exceeded, using FHA manual underwriting and compensating factor guidelines. Read FHA's new DTI Mortgage Letter on HUD's website.
Raising Down Payment on Loans above $625,500
Through a Federal Register Notice to be published in the next several days, FHA will announce a proposed increased down payment requirement for mortgages with original principal balances above $625,500. The minimum down payment for these mortgages will increase from 3.5 to 5 percent. This change, coupled with the statutory maximum premiums charged for these loans, will help protect FHA and further facilitate its efforts to encourage higher levels of private market participation in the housing finance market. Read FHA's new Federal Register Notice (www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2013-02-06/pdf/2013-02667.pdf).
Access to FHA after Foreclosure
FHA will step up its enforcement efforts for FHA-approved lenders with regard to aggressive marketing to borrowers with previous foreclosures and remind lenders of their duty to fully underwrite loan applications. New loans must meet all FHA guidelines.
Borrowers are currently able to access FHA-insured financing no sooner than three years after they have experienced a foreclosure, but only if they have re-established good credit and qualify for an FHA loan in accordance with FHA's fully documented underwriting requirements. It has come to FHA's attention that a few lenders are inappropriately advertising and soliciting borrowers with the false pretense that they can somehow ""automatically"" qualify for an FHA-insured mortgage three years after their foreclosure. This is simply not true and such misleading advertising will not be tolerated.
Moreover, FHA will work with other federal agencies to address such false advertising by non-FHA-approved entities. Finally, as discussed in its Annual Report to Congress, FHA is also committed to structuring a new housing counseling initiative that would apply to a number of borrower classifications, including borrowers with previous foreclosures.
Continuing Effort to Improve Risk Management
The changes announced this week will further contribute to the efforts made throughout the Obama Administration's tenure to improve risk management at FHA and protect the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund. Because of these commitments, the changes made at FHA over the past four years have already added more than $20 billion in value to the MMI Fund."
01/31/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-012.cfm,Donovan and Demarco Announce Extended Foreclosure Relief for Hurricane Sandy Storm Victims,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan, who serves as President Obama's Chairman of the Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force, and Federal Housing Finance Agency Acting Director Edward J. DeMarco today announced that the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac will extend expiring protections against foreclosure actions against homeowners whose properties were damaged or destroyed due to Hurricane Sandy.
The additional 90-day foreclosure moratorium applies to homeowners with properties in states where the President issued major disaster declarations following Hurricane Sandy. The extended moratoriums announced today apply to the initiation of foreclosures and foreclosures already in process.
""It's all too clear that families need more time to get back on their feet without having a foreclosure or eviction hanging over their heads,"" said Donovan. ""As we work to rebuild after this historic storm, we'll do everything we can to ease the crushing burden being faced by those homeowners, many of whom have been forced from their homes.""
""Given the magnitude of this disaster, extending the moratorium on foreclosures and evictions will allow homeowners in the affected areas, and their servicers, the time needed to assess individual circumstances and options,"" said DeMarco.
FHA is extending moratoriums for another 90 days on the initiation of foreclosures and foreclosures already in process. FHA is also suspending evictions of persons from properties secured by FHA mortgages in these affected counties through April 30, 2013.
After consultation with FHA, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will also extend the suspension of foreclosure sales and eviction lockouts for borrowers impacted by Hurricane Sandy. The new 90-day extension applies to homeowners with properties or employment within the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) declared disaster area eligible for individual assistance. This follows an earlier 90-day suspension of foreclosure sales and evictions in the impacted areas. In addition to the foreclosure sale and eviction moratorium, homeowners impacted by Hurricane Sandy may be eligible for forbearance, loan modifications or waived late payment charges."

HUD will provide support to homeowners and low-income renters forced from their homes due to Hurricane Sandy.
On January 10, President Obama issued a disaster declaration for Bedford, Bucks, Cameron, Dauphin, Forest, Franklin, Fulton, Huntingdon, Juniata, Monroe, Montgomery, Northampton, Pike, Potter, Somerset, Sullivan and Wyoming counties. The President's declaration allows HUD to offer foreclosure relief and other assistance to certain families living in these counties.
""Families who may have been forced from their homes need to know that help is available to begin the rebuilding process,"" said Donovan. ""Whether it's foreclosure relief for families with FHA-insured loans or helping these counties to recover, HUD stands ready to help in any way we can.""

02/04/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-011.cfm,Federal Agencies Working to Make Homes Healthier,"WASHINGTON - Several federal agencies today unveiled Advancing Healthy Housing - A Strategy for Action. White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) Chair Nancy Sutley, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lisa P. Jackson, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Shaun Donovan, Surgeon General Regina Benjamin, M.D., and Deputy Secretary of Energy Daniel Poneman discussed the new plan during an event at the National Building Museum this morning.
The initiative represents a bold new vision for addressing the nation's health and economic burdens caused by preventable hazards associated with the home. The Strategy for Action encourages federal agencies to take preemptive actions that will help reduce the number of American homes with health and safety hazards.
People in the United States spend about 70% of their time in a home. Currently, millions of U.S. homes have moderate to severe physical housing problems, including dilapidated structure; roofing problems; heating, plumbing, and electrical deficiencies; water leaks and intrusion; pests; damaged paint; and high radon gas levels. These conditions are associated with a wide range of health issues, including unintentional injuries, respiratory illnesses like asthma and radon-induced lung cancer, lead poisoning, result in lost school days for children, as well as lost productivity in the labor force. The health and economic burdens from preventable hazards associated with the home are considerable, and cost billions of dollars.
The Strategy for Action unifies, for the first time, federal action to advance healthy housing, demonstrating the connection between housing conditions and residents' health. It also promotes strategies and methods intended to reduce in-home health hazards in a cost-effective manner.
""It is clear that unhealthy and unsafe housing has an impact on the health of millions of people in the United States, which is why we must do everything we can to ensure that individuals and families have a healthy place to call home,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""Today's announcement will help the federal government unify action to controlling and preventing major housing-related exposures and hazards.""
""Thanks to unprecedented collaboration across the federal family and among our many partners, we now have a specific plan for action to address radon and other preventable hazards found in homes across the country. This is important progress, especially when you consider that people spend an estimated 70 percent of their time inside a home,"" said EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson. ""At EPA we're committed to ensuring Americans in all communities have healthy places to live, work and play, and the strategy we announced today is a critical step toward reaching that goal.""
""Healthy homes and communities are essential to our quality of life, our productivity, and our economic vitality,"" said Nancy Sutley, Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality. ""Through this plan, Federal agencies have committed to working together to make sure all Americans can count on safe, healthy places to live, grow, and thrive.""
Dr. Mary Jean Brown, Chief of CDC's Healthy Homes and Lead Poisoning Prevention Branch added, ""Healthy homes lead to healthier lives. People can take simple steps to protect themselves from health hazards in the home.""
""Energy efficiency and healthy homes are inextricably linked,"" explained U.S. Deputy Secretary of Energy Daniel Poneman. ""We cannot, in good conscience, pursue one in the absence of the other. DOE is committed to ensuring that our efforts towards creating an efficient national housing stock also strive to maximize the health and safety of the families we serve.""
The overall vision for the Strategy is to reduce the number of American homes with residential health and safety hazards, achieved through five goals:
• Establish healthy homes recommendations
• Encourage adoption of healthy homes recommendations
• Create and support training and workforce development to address health hazards in housing
• Educate the public about healthy homes
• Support research that informs and advances healthy housing in a cost-effective manner

02/06/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-014.cfm,HUD Announces First Round of Allocations of Hurricane Sandy Recovery Funds,"WASHINGTON - The Department of Housing and Urban Development today allocated $5.4 billion in Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Disaster Recovery funding to five states and New York City, representing the first round of CDBG grants from the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act of 2013 signed into law by President Obama on January 29. This is the fastest HUD has ever allocated CDBG funding to grantees following the passage of a funding bill.
""It is critical for HUD to make this funding available as quickly as possible so families can begin rebuilding and repairing their homes and small businesses can get back on their feet,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan, who also chairs the Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force established by President Obama in December. ""We continue to focus on providing funding and other resources to those in the most immediate need, while laying the groundwork for the region to rebuild in ways that make communities stronger, more economically sustainable and more resilient.""
The allocations represent 34 percent of the $16 billion in CDBG funding included in the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act. The first allocation is distributed as follows:
New York City - $1.77 billion State of New York - $1.71 billion New Jersey - $1.83 billion Connecticut - $71.8 million Maryland - $8.6 million Rhode Island - $3.2 million
• New York City - $1.77 billion
• State of New York - $1.71 billion
• New Jersey - $1.83 billion
• Connecticut - $71.8 million
• Maryland - $8.6 million
• Rhode Island - $3.2 million
The funding level of the first allocation is based on data from the FEMA Individual Assistance Program and the Small Business Administration's disaster loan programs, which HUD used to identify the areas of greatest need in the region impacted by Hurricane Sandy. These allocations will be published in the Federal Register in the coming weeks along with criteria for their use. Following the State's submission of an action plan describing how funds will be used, HUD will conduct an expedited review to enable funds to be accessed as quickly as possible. HUD has worked closely with state and local partners throughout this process to facilitate action plans being approved as soon as possible.
The CDBG Disaster Recovery funding gives grantees significant flexibility in determining how best to use their funds to meet the greatest unmet needs. In general, the funds are intended for the restoration of housing and infrastructure as well as economic revitalization in disaster-impacted areas. The funds are to meet recovery needs that are not otherwise covered by insurance, FEMA, SBA, or other sources. HUD expects the first round of allocations to focus largely on housing and small business needs.
HUD, OMB and the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board, which was established by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, will provide oversight to prevent and identify waste, fraud and abuse. In addition, the Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force, established by President Obama to coordinate the federal government's efforts to support local rebuilding, has gone further by establishing a Project Management Office to monitor spending and progress to ensure the money is used as intended."
02/06/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-015.cfm,"HUD, PNC Bank Settle Maternity Discrimination Claim","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has reached an Agreement with PNC Mortgage in Trumbull, CT, settling allegations that the lender violated the Fair Housing Act by requiring a home loan applicant on paid maternity leave to return to work before the lender would approve a home loan. PNC Mortgage is a division of Virginia-based PNC Bank National Association.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in the sale, rental, and financing of dwellings, and in other housing-related transactions, based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, and disability. Refusing to approve a mortgage loan or provide refinancing because a woman is pregnant or on maternity leave violates the Fair Housing Act's prohibitions against sex and familial status discrimination.
""Since 2010, HUD has been investigating lenders who have allegedly violated the Fair Housing Act by requiring women to terminate their maternity leave early in order to qualify for a home loan,"" stated John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing & Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will continue to enforce the law and take action against lenders whose loan policies establish different terms and conditions for women who are pregnant or on maternity leave.""
HUD's complaint alleged that because PNC required the woman, a Navy veteran, to return to work before approving the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) - guaranteed loan, the couple could not close on their new home in Newington, CT, until a month later than they had planned. As a result, the seller of the home allegedly required the couple to pay an additional $3,000 for the delay.
Under the Agreement, PNC will pay $15,000 to the couple and review applications for VA-guaranteed residential mortgage loans filed in the last two years in Maine, Vermont, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, and New York to identify qualified loan seekers whose applications were denied because they were pregnant or on maternity leave. PNC will pay $7,500 each victim who is identified. PNC will also revise its Temporary Leave/Short-Term Disability Income policy if HUD finds that the policy is deficient, and will provide fair lending training to its residential mortgage loan originators, underwriters, and processors.
HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity and its partners in the Fair Housing Assistance Program investigate almost 10,000 housing discrimination complaints each year.
Persons who believe they have experienced or witnessed unlawful housing discrimination may contact HUD at (800) 669-9777 (voice), or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). More information about fair housing rights is available at HUD's website, www.hud.gov/fairhousing."
02/08/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-022.cfm,HUD Issues Rule Formalizing Standard on Discriminatory Effects in Housing,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is issuing a final rule to formalize the national standard for determining whether a housing practice violates the Fair Housing Act as the result of discriminatory effect.
""Through the issuance of this Rule, HUD is reaffirming its commitment to enforcing the Fair Housing Act in a consistent and uniform manner,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""This will ensure the continued strength of one of the most important tools for exposing and ending housing discrimination.""
HUD is statutorily charged with the authority and responsibility for interpreting and enforcing the Fair Housing Act and has long interpreted the Act to prohibit housing practices with an unjustified discriminatory effect, if those acts actually or predictably result in a disparate impact on a group of persons, or create, increase, reinforce, or perpetuate segregated housing patterns because of race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin.
""HUD is maintaining well-established legal precedent and formalizing a nationally consistent, uniform burden-shifting test for determining whether a given housing practice has an unjustified discriminatory effect,"" said John Trasviña, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity.
The rule provides clarity and consistency for individuals, businesses, and government entities subject to the Fair Housing Act. HUD anticipates the rule also will make it easier for individuals and organizations covered by the law to understand their responsibilities and comply with the law.
The review process for the rule was expansive, transparent, and inclusive. Since January 2012, the Department solicited, received, and incorporated input based on comments from individuals, fair housing and legal aid organizations, Attorneys General, state housing finance agencies, public housing agencies, public housing trade associations, insurance companies, financial institutions, and numerous other entities.
""The openness of this process allowed us to implement a rule that can be consistently and fairly applied,"" noted Trasviña.

02/08/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-023.cfm,Obama Administration Releases January Housing Scorecard,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of the Treasury today released the January edition of the Obama Administration's Housing Scorecard - a comprehensive report on the nation's housing market. Data continue to show signs that the housing market is strengthening, with the number of underwater borrowers continuing to decline as home prices continue to improve, although officials cautionthat there is regional variation and the overall economic recovery remains fragile. The full Housing Scorecard is available online at www.hud.gov/scorecard.
""The Obama Administration's efforts to speed housing recovery are showing continued progress as the January scorecard indicators highlight clear forward momentum in the housing market,"" said HUD Deputy Assistant Secretary for Economic Affairs Kurt Usowski. ""The housing market has clearly bottomed out nationally and is turning a corner with new home construction increasing to a level not seen since June 2008 and home prices showing strong annual gains. But with so many households still struggling, we have important work ahead.""
""Making Home Affordable has directly helped more than one million homeowners avoid foreclosure and indirectly helped millions more by prompting critical changes in the way the mortgage industry assists struggling homeowners,"" said Treasury Assistant Secretary for Financial Stability Tim Massad. ""Every foreclosure avoided has positive impacts for families, communities, and our economy.""
The January Housing Scorecard features key data on the health of the housing market and the impact of the Administration's foreclosure prevention programs, including:
The Administration's foreclosure prevention programs are providing relief for millions of homeowners as we continue to recover from an unprecedented housing crisis. Nearly 1.5 million homeowner assistance actions have taken place through the Making Home Affordable Program, while the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) has offered more than 1.5 million loss mitigation and early delinquency interventions. The Administration's programs continue to encourage improved standards and processes in the industry, with HOPE Now lenders offering families and individuals more than 3 million proprietary mortgage modifications through November. Homeowners in HAMP continue to benefit from deep payment relief, helping them sustain their mortgage payments over time. As of December, more than 1.1 million homeowners have received a permanent modification through the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP), saving approximately $545 on their mortgage payments each month, and an estimated $17.3 billion to date. Eighty-seven percent of homeowners starting the program in the last two and a half years have received a permanent modification of their mortgage through HAMP. Payment relief is strongly correlated to sustainability of modified payments over time. As a result, after six months in the program, more than 94 percent of homeowners remain in their permanent HAMP modification. HAMP modifications continue to exhibit lower delinquency and re-default rates than industry modifications as reported by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.

Also featured this month in the Administration's Housing Scorecard Regional Spotlight on market strength is Detroit, Michigan. Similar to other parts of the Midwest, the foreclosure crisis in Detroit developed earlier and differently than in other areas of the nation.
""The continuing signs of stability that the national data show for the broader housing market are also beginning to appear in Detroit,"" said Usowski. ""As this Regional Spotlight shows, the Administration's efforts have helped nearly 100,000 Detroit households avoid foreclosure. A modest local economic recovery is underway, but we have much more to do to reach the many households who still face trouble and to help the Detroit market recover more broadly.""
The Housing Scorecard Regional Spotlight features data on the health of the Detroit housing market and impact of efforts to help homeowners at the local level including:
Economic conditions in Detroit are improving despite the city experiencing a much higher rate of foreclosures and a higher unemployment rate than the rest of the nation. Although nearly 7 percent of housing units have been foreclosed since early 2009, the rate is down to 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2012. The unemployment rate for Detroit peaked at 16.0 percent in October 2009 and has declined to 10.8 percent as of December 2012. The Administration's Hardest Hit Fund and Neighborhood Stabilization Programs have fueled local foreclosure prevention efforts and market stability, while nearly100,000 households have received mortgage modifications, many directly through Administration programs. Treasury provided $499 million to the State of Michigan to provide assistance to struggling homeowners through the Hardest Hit Fund. The number of homeowners benefitting from the program has continued to increase due to growing demand.Moreover, approximately $208 million has been awarded to Detroit through HUD's Neighborhood Stabilization Program to help purchase or redevelop residential properties and address the effects of abandoned and foreclosed housing. Both programs have helped provide increased stability to the Detroit housing market. In addition, more than 10,000 Michigan homeowners are currently benefiting from nearly $500 million in refinancing, short sales and completed or trial loan modifications, including principal reduction on first and second lien mortgages provided under the landmark National Mortgage Servicing Settlement. Nationwide, the settlement has provided more than $26.1 billion in consumer relief benefits to over 300,000 families. That is in addition to the $2.5 billion in payments to participating states and $1.5 billion in direct payments to borrowers who were foreclosed upon between 2008 and 2011.

02/12/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-024.cfm,HUD and HHS Partner to Provide Permanent Housing and Services to Low-Income People with Disabilities,"WASHINGTON - To prevent thousands of people with disabilities from experiencing homelessness or unnecessary institutionalization, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) today announced nearly $98 million in funding for 13 state housing agencies for rental assistance to extremely low-income persons with disabilities, many of whom are transitioning out of institutional settings or are at high risk of homelessness.
HUD's support of these state agencies is made possible through the Section 811 Project Rental Assistance Demonstration Program (PRA Demo) which enables persons with disabilities who earn less than 30 percent of median income to live in integrated mainstream settings. The state housing agencies are working closely with their state Medicaid and Health and Human Service counterparts to identify, refer, and conduct outreach to persons with disabilities who require long-term services and supports to live independently.
""By working together, HUD and HHS are helping states to offer permanent housing and critically needed supportive services to offer real and lasting assistance to persons who might otherwise be institutionalized or living on our streets,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""We're helping states reduce health care costs, improving quality of life for persons with disabilities, and ending homelessness as we know it.""
""Our nation is strongest when all our citizens are able to fully participate and contribute,"" said HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. ""This unique collaboration of federal and state agencies will enable thousands of Americans with disabilities to lead productive, meaningful lives in their communities.""
Today's announcement reinforces the guiding principles of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the landmark 1999 Supreme Court ruling in Olmstead v. L.C., which require state and local governments to provide services in the most integrated settings appropriate to meet the needs of individuals with disabilities.
The rental assistance announced today also supports the Obama Administration's long term strategy to prevent and end homelessness. The Dedicating Opportunities to End Homelessness (DOEH) Initiative is a joint effort by HUD and the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH) designed to help communities match their homeless supports with other mainstream resources such as housing choice vouchers, public housing, private multifamily housing units, and other federally funded services. The initiative is beginning in 10 critically important communities: Atlanta, Chicago, Fresno County, Los Angeles County, Houston, New Orleans, Philadelphia, Phoenix/Maricopa County, Seattle, and Tampa.

Authorized under the Frank Melville Supportive Housing Investment Act of 2010, HUD's Section 811 Project Rental Assistance Demonstration Program provides funding to states for project-based rental assistance to develop permanent affordable housing options in integrated settings for extremely low-income persons with disabilities. Under the state health care/housing agency partnership, each state has in place a policy for referrals, tenant selection, and service delivery to ensure that this housing is targeted to those persons with disabilities most in need of affordable housing with supportive services"
02/13/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-025.cfm,"HUD Awards $7.3 Million to Provide Training, Affordable Housing Consulting for Native Americans, Alaskans and Hawaiians","WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan announced today that eight organizations will receive a total of $7.3 million in grants to improve housing conditions in Native American, Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian communities.
""These organizations have a proven track record of assisting tribal communities in their work to provide safe, decent, and affordable housing to members of these communities,"" said Donovan. ""As HUD Secretary, I have seen firsthand how important our investment is in Indian Country and other Native lands to help them reach their housing and community development goals.""
HUD Office of Native American Program (ONAP) Training and Technical Assistance grants were awarded to these organizations today:
These grantees will work directly with the 566 federally recognized Indian tribes and Native Alaskan villages who receive HUD Indian Housing Block Grants (IHBG) or Native Hawaiian Housing Block Grants (NHHBG) to provide training and technical assistance related to their affordable housing plans. For example, the organizations can use the funding to conduct educational conferences for multiple tribes on specific topics such as ""energy-efficient/sustainable construction,"" or to provide on-site, one-on-one consultation to tribes to resolve challenges that prevent them from creating sustainable, affordable housing for their members.
Funds from both programs are intended to primarily benefit low-income families living on Indian reservations or Alaskan and Hawaiian communities. The funding is used for a range of affordable housing activities, including: new construction, rehabilitation, acquisition, infrastructure, and various support services. Housing can be either rental or homeownership. NHHBG funds can also be used for certain types of community facilities if the facilities serve eligible residents of affordable housing."
02/13/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-026.cfm,"HUD, Minnesota Condo Association Settle Discrimination Claim","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that a homeowners association and property managers for an Edina, MN, condominium will pay more than $40,000 under a Consent Order resolving allegations that they refused to allow children under the age of 18 to live at the property in violation of the Fair Housing Act.
HUD charged 7000 Sandell Condominium Association, Inc., its property management company, New Concepts Management Group, Inc., and the property's off-site manager, Paul L. Bonzonie, with violating the Fair Housing Act for maintaining a policy that prohibited children from living in the building. Additionally, HUD charged that the condominium association failed to adhere to requirements necessary to establish an exemption under the Housing for Older Persons Act.
""Condominium associations may not routinely deny families the right to have their children live with them,"" stated John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will continue to take action any time a family's fair housing rights are violated just because they have children.""
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers, including condominium associations, from denying housing to families with children under the age of 18, unless the housing meets the federal standards to be housing for older persons.
According to a condominium owner's complaint filed with HUD, the condominium association told him and his wife that they were violating the association's document by allowing their minor children to live with them for more than 30 days in a calendar year. In addition, the condominium association levied fines against them and initiated a lawsuit in Minnesota state court in an effort to keep the couple's children from living with them. HUD alleged that the condominium association failed to meet federal requirements to qualify as housing for older persons because the association failed to formally and routinely verify the ages of the complex's residents.
Under the terms of the Consent Order, 7000 Sandell Condominium Association, Inc., its property management company, and the property's off-site manager will pay the owner $30,000, pay his attorney $12,200, and allow the couple and their children to live in the condominium without fear of retaliation or harassment."
02/13/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-029.cfm,Donovan Announces Streamlined Approval Process for Multifamily Apartment Owners in New York and New Jersey,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan, who also chairs President Obama's Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force, today announced that the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) will speed the approval of applications of multifamily apartment owners in New York and New Jersey seeking to refinance their mortgages, substantially rehabilitate their properties or construct new developments in areas impacted by Hurricane Sandy.
Effective immediately, the streamlined approval process announced today is intended to accelerate access to mortgage financing for apartment owners and to facilitate recovery in the multifamily residential sector in both states that were especially hard hit by Sandy.
""Today's announcement is intended to make certain that those multifamily apartment owners in New York and New Jersey get priority treatment when applying for FHA-insured mortgages,"" said Donovan. ""We have to do everything we can to support the long-term rebuilding efforts in these impacted areas to the greatest degree we can and this is one way we can.""
On December 7, 2012, the President issued an Executive Order establishing the Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force and directed Donovan to lead the Task Force and, to the extent permitted by law, align relevant programs and authorities with a long-term rebuilding plan that supports the region's economic vitality, enhance infrastructure, and ensure appropriate accountability. Accordingly, the notice issued today applies to any multifamily project applying for mortgage insurance in presidentially declared disaster areas in New York or New Jersey, whether or not the property was directly damaged by the recent storms.

02/21/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-030.cfm,National Mortgage Settlement Provides Over $45 Billion in Consumer Relief,"WASHINGTON - The nation's largest mortgage servicers have distributed $45.83 billion in direct relief to over 550,000 homeowners, or roughly $82,000 per homeowner as part of the National Mortgage Settlement, according to a progress report released today by independent settlement monitor Joseph A. Smith of the Office of Mortgage Settlement Oversight. Almost one year ago, the Department of Justice, Department of Housing Urban Development (HUD) and 49 state attorneys general reached a landmark agreement with the nation's five largest mortgage servicers to address mortgage loan servicing and foreclosure abuses.
""As we reach the one year anniversary, the latest report marks a major milestone in our efforts to assist struggling homeowners,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""We have already surpassed our initial expectations and the settlement is testament to the fact that large scale principal reduction can be used an important tool in our efforts to prevent foreclosures without incurring negative results.""
""The Justice Department, with our federal and state partners, negotiated the settlement as part of our ongoing commitment to protect American homeowners and taxpayers from unlawful mortgage servicer conduct,"" said Acting Associate Attorney General Tony West. ""As we approach the first anniversary of the landmark settlement, we are pleased that so many homeowners have been helped. The Department will work vigilantly to ensure that the settlement's terms continue to be implemented effectively.""
The report demonstrates significant progress on the broadest and most robust principal reduction program in the nation's history. More than $22.48 billion of the overall completed consumer relief has come in the form of debt forgiveness. Because of the settlement, the principal reduction helps borrowers stay in their homes, lowering monthly payments on over 266,000 loans and actually reducing struggling homeowners' loan balances by more than $84,000 on average.
This is in addition to the funds that states allocated for settlement-related purposes, including over $250 million for housing counseling and another $50 million to legal aid.
""Now that we have clear signs that our housing market has gained momentum, and it is clear that this settlement is providing some of the critical tools for that momentum to continue,"" said Donovan. ""The job's not done - and we will continue to watch the banks like hawks to ensure they live up to their obligations as they complete their consumer relief requirements and we measure their progress on implementing new and improved servicing standards.""

In 2011, HUD reports nearly 8.5 million lower income families paid more than half their monthly income for rent, lived in severely substandard housing, or both.
HUD's Worst Case Housing Needs 2011: A Summary Report to Congress (www.huduser.org/portal/publications/affhsg/wc_HsgNeeds11.html) is part of a long-term series of reports designed to measure the scale of critical housing problems facing very low-income un-assisted renters. Based on data from HUD's 2011 American Housing Survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau between May and September of 2011, the number of these ""Worst Case Housing Needs"" continued to grow from the previous record high in 2009 (7.1 million households) by a striking 43.5 percent since 2007.
""These sobering numbers remind us that as we work to craft a balanced approach to our budget and priorities, we can't lose sight of those who may be teetering on the brink of homelessness,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""Clearly, the economic downturn that we're recovering from put tremendous stress on lower income families who continue to be crowded out of the affordable housing marketplace. Today's report is a wakeup call to all of us working to make sure every family has a decent place to call home.""
These worst case housing needs are defined as renters with very low incomes (below half the median in their area) who do not receive government housing assistance and who either paid more than half their monthly incomes for rent, lived in severely substandard conditions, or both. HUD's report finds that housing needs cut across all regions of the country and included all racial and ethnic groups, regardless of whether they lived in cities, suburbs or rural areas. In addition, HUD concluded that large numbers of worst case needs were also found across various household types including families with children, senior citizens, and persons with disabilities.
HUD's report found:
Worst case housing needs were 8.5 million in 2011 up from 7.1 million in 2009. This represents a 19 percent increase from 2009 and 43 percent over levels reported in 2007.
• Worst case housing needs were 8.5 million in 2011 up from 7.1 million in 2009. This represents a 19 percent increase from 2009 and 43 percent over levels reported in 2007.

Every racial/ethnic group experienced increases in worst case housing needs during 2009-2011 with Hispanic and non-Hispanic white households having the largest increase. As a result, 48 percent of new cases of worst case needs were White, 28 percent where Hispanic and 13 percent were African-American households. The number of 'worst case' renter households increased primarily because a substantial number of homeowners became renters as a result of economic and housing market conditions such as unemployment and foreclosures. Higher income families increasingly competed for a limited number of affordable rental units further driving down already-low vacancy rates for the lowest rent units.

Government housing assistance programs, including those provided by HUD, significantly reduce worst case needs and homelessness but are not available for all those who need assistance. Nationwide, approximately one-in-four very low-income households receive some form of rental assistance. The Obama Administration has been taking strong action to respond to the decline in family incomes and increase in need for affordable housing:
Through a variety of rental assistance programs, HUD helps approximately 4.5 million families to find suitable affordable housing. Opening Doors - Opening Doors (www.usich.gov/OpeningDoors.html) is the nation's first comprehensive strategy to prevent and end homelessness. The plan puts the country on a path to end veteran and chronic homelessness by 2015; and to ending homelessness among children, family, and youth by 2020.

02/28/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-031.cfm,HUD Launches First Fair Housing App,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today unveiled the first housing discrimination mobile application (app) for iPhone and iPad. Developed by HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity (FHEO) and Hewlett Packard (HP), the app uses the latest technology to provide the public with a quick and easy way to learn about their housing rights and to file housing discrimination complaints, and inform the housing industry about its responsibilities under the Fair Housing Act.
The app will also be an important tool to assist fair housing groups and other civil rights advocacy organizations in their efforts to help individuals pursue their housing rights and industry to educate their members on their responsibilities. Several groups indicated their intent to promote the app with their members and in communities where they work, including MomsRising, Illinois Department of Human Rights, Access Living, League of United Latin American Citizens, Asian Real Estate Association of America, National Association of Hispanic Real Estate Professionals, National Association of Real Estate Brokers, and the National Center for Lesbian Rights.
""Having this first fair housing mobile application equips people everywhere with the information they need to combat housing discrimination,"" said John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""We are maximizing the latest technology to make the process for filing fair housing complaints faster and easier and arming our fair housing partners with the information they need to understand their fair housing rights and responsibilities.""
HUD's new fair housing app was unveiled during the 3rd Annual MobileGov Summit in Washington, DC, a conference which brings government and industry IT leaders together to discuss the latest trends and best practices for creating the next generation mobile government workforce.
""HUD needed an efficient and reliable solution to quickly extend existing capabilities to mobile computing devices,"" said Marilyn Crouther, senior vice president and general manager, U.S. Public Sector, HP Enterprise Services. ""The new HP application achieves operational goals of HUD - from concept to deployment - while more effectively addressing discrimination complaints. The mobile app simplifies and increases access to government services for people.""
In addition to facilitating real-time delivery of housing discrimination complaints to HUD, the app can be used by individuals researching their housing rights after a natural disaster, when power outages make the iPhone/iPad one of the few ways to access the Internet.
The app also provides information about the fair housing complaint process, and allows the public to access HUD's toll-free discrimination hotline and link to HUD's fair housing website: www.hud.gov/fairhousing.
In conjunction with the fair housing mobile application, FHEO has released HTML 5 adaptive mobile pages, which are in English and Spanish and allow web content to display properly regardless of the brand of smartphone or tablet being used. In addition, the adaptive mobile pages allow individuals to complete and submit the fair housing complaint form in Spanish. FHEO also plans to design a ""Quick Response code"" ad campaign, directing mobile users to the new adaptive pages.

Watch the signing ceremony on HUD's YouTube channel (www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgmgQgYVd9I&feature=youtu.be).
Donovan, who also chairs President Obama's Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force, recently visited the Netherlands to see first-hand how that country deals with the persistent threat of North Sea and river flooding in large low-lying developed areas.
""Our two nations have much to learn from each other about finding innovative solutions to age-old shared problems,"" said Donovan. ""The Dutch are no strangers to the forces of nature and I'm certain we can benefit from their experience in disaster mitigation, infrastructure management and a variety of approaches to sustainable community development and planning.""
""Although the scale of our landscapes differs, New York and the Netherlands have a lot in common,"" said Minister Schultz. ""Both areas are river deltas. Both areas have estuaries, rivers and water basins that are vulnerable to flooding. The Netherlands has a long history in water management, but I am not coming only to bring Dutch expertise. I am also coming to learn from the American approach.""
Over the generations, Dutch planners created a vast network of dams, floodgates, storm surge barriers and other engineered works to control North Sea storm surge and flooding from the confluence of three major river systems. In recent years, Dutch engineers have also adopted hazard mitigation strategies that allow for controlled flooding in formerly developed areas.
The HUD-Dutch Memorandum of Understanding lays out certain areas of cooperation over the next five years including:
Creating new community development strategies that place a premium on sustainability and 'livability' principles; Pursuing infrastructure and water management strategies and climate resilience and preparedness, including new approaches to flood protection systems and 'building with nature;' and Leveraging private and philanthropic investments to maximize public investments in urban development and long-term disaster mitigation.

03/08/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-033.cfm,Obama Administration Releases February Housing Scorecard,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of the Treasury today released the February edition of the Obama Administration's Housing Scorecard - a comprehensive report on the nation's housing market. Data continue to show important progress across many key indicators—as home prices ended the year with strong gains and purchases of new homes and sales of existing homes were also strong—although officials caution that the overall recovery remains fragile. The full Housing Scorecard is available online at www.hud.gov/scorecard.
""The Obama Administration's efforts to speed housing recovery are showing continued progress as the February scorecard indicators highlight ongoing improvements throughout the housing market,"" said HUD Deputy Assistant Secretary for Economic Affairs Kurt Usowski. ""House prices are steadily rising above the mid-crisis lows in markets throughout the country, while inventories of new and existing homes are further tightening, and even estimates of the 'shadow inventory' are down. That said, we still remain considerably below long-term normal levels of home sales and production.""
Included in this month's Making Home Affordable Program Report (www.treasury.gov/initiatives/financial-stability/reports/Pages/Making-Home-Affordable-Program-Performance-Report.aspx) are detailed assessments from the fourth quarter of 2012 for the largest mortgage servicers participating in the program. These Servicer Assessments - first introduced in June 2011 and published quarterly - have set a new standard for disclosure around servicer efforts to assist struggling homeowners.
""The Administration continues to improve outcomes for homeowners seeking mortgage relief by setting new standards for customer service and holding mortgage companies publicly accountable,"" said Treasury Assistant Secretary for Financial Stability Tim Massad. ""As a result, struggling families today have stronger consumer protections and more sustainable options to avoid foreclosure.""
Since inception of the Making Home Affordable Program, Treasury has required participating servicers to take specific actions to improve their processes through ongoing program reviews. The quarterly Servicer Assessments summarize performance in three categories of program implementation: identifying and contacting homeowners; homeowner evaluation and assistance; and program reporting, management and governance. Results for the fourth quarter of 2012 show that servicers are focusing attention on areas identified in previous program reviews and, as a result, are demonstrating continued improvement in program implementation:
Servicers are more effectively evaluating homeowners under program eligibility criteria as seen in the ""second look disagree"" category, which reflects the rate at which Treasury's program reviews disagree with the servicers' decision to find a homeowner ineligible for assistance. In the fourth quarter, the average second look disagree rate for the top servicers was below two percent. Mortgage servicers continue to accurately calculate homeowner income, which is used to determine a homeowner's eligibility and modified payment amount under the program. In the fourth quarter, the average income calculation error rate for the top servicers went down from the previous quarter, and three servicers had a zero percent error rate.

For the fourth quarter of 2012, two servicers were found to need only minor improvement on the areas reviewed for program performance, while seven servicers were found to need moderate improvement. Although servicer performance in a particular compliance category can fluctuate from quarter to quarter, in general, servicers continue to show continued overall improvement in program implementation. All servicers, however, will need to continue to demonstrate progress in any areas identified in subsequent program reviews.
The February Housing Scorecard features key data on the health of the housing market and the impact of the Administration's foreclosure prevention programs, including:
The Administration's foreclosure mitigation programs are providing relief for millions of homeowners as we continue to recover from an unprecedented housing crisis. More than 1.5 million homeowner assistance actions have taken place through the Making Home Affordable Program, while the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) has offered more than 1.6 million loss mitigation and early delinquency interventions. The Administration's programs continue to encourage improved standards and processes in the industry, with HOPE Now lenders offering families and individuals more than 3.4 million proprietary mortgage modifications through December. HAMP continues to offer homeowners affordable and sustainable relief to avoid foreclosure. As of January, more than 1.1 million homeowners have received a permanent modification through the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP), saving approximately $546 on their mortgage payments each month, and an estimated $17.9 billion to date. In January, 69 percent of homeowners with eligible non-GSE mortgages benefitted from principal reduction with their HAMP modification. Homeowners currently in permanent HAMP modifications have been granted an estimated $9.2 billion in total principal reduction.

03/13/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-034.cfm,"Obama Administration Renews Support for More Than 7,000 Local Homeless Programs Across the U.S.","WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Shaun Donovan today renewed support for 7,000 local homeless housing and service programs across the U.S. Provided through HUD's Continuum of Care Program, the funding announced today will ensure these local projects remain operating in the coming year. This year, HUD challenged local communities to reexamine their response to homelessness and give greater weight to proven strategies, from providing 'rapid re-housing' for homeless families to permanent supportive housing for those experiencing chronic homelessness (see attached chart).
The $1.5 billion in grants announced today support a wide range of programs including street outreach, client assessment, and direct housing assistance. Later this year, HUD will award additional grant funding to support hundreds of other local programs. View a complete list of all the state and local homeless projects awarded funding on HUD's website.
""The evidence is clear that every dollar we spend on those programs that help find a stable home for our homeless neighbors not only saves money but quite literally saves lives,"" said Donovan. ""We know these programs work and we know these grants can mean the difference between homeless persons and families finding stable housing or living on our streets.""
Continuum of Care grants are awarded competitively to local projects to meet the needs of their homeless clients. The grants fund a wide variety of programs from street outreach and assessment to transitional and permanent housing for homeless persons and families. HUD funds are a critical part of the Obama Administration's strategic plan to prevent and end homelessness.
While the Fiscal Year 2012 funds awarded today are not impacted by the automatic across-the-board budget cuts under sequestration that began March 1st, Donovan cautioned that future budget cuts may reverse significant reported declines in homelessness: ""During this challenging budget climate, we must make certain that we don't balance our books on the backs of our most vulnerable citizens. When we make even modest investments in these programs, we see a measurable decline in homelessness.""
HUD recently announced its 2012 ""point in time"" estimate of the number of homeless persons in America. Approximately 3,000 cities and counties reported 633,782 homeless persons on a single night in January of 2012, largely unchanged from the year before. While HUD found significant declines among the long-term homeless and veterans, local communities reported an increase in the number of sheltered and unsheltered families with children.
HUD's Continuum of Care grants announced today will continue offering permanent and transitional housing to homeless persons as well as services including job training, health care, mental health counseling, substance abuse treatment and child care. Continuum of Care grants are awarded competitively to local programs to meet the needs of their homeless clients.
In 2010, President Obama and 19 federal agencies and offices that form the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH) launched the nation's first comprehensive strategy to prevent and end homelessness. Opening Doors: Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness (www.usich.gov/opening_doors/) puts the country on a path to end veterans and chronic homelessness by 2015 and to ending homelessness among children, family, and youth by 2020."
03/14/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-035.cfm,HUD and Census Bureau Release New Survey on Characteristics of Nation's Multi-Family Rental Properties,"WASHINGTON - Approximately 20 percent of American households live in multi-family rental buildings, yet until today little was known about how these larger rental properties are financed. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Census Bureau today released the new 2012 Rental Housing Finance Survey (www.census.gov/hhes/rhfs/), which provides a more complete picture of the nation's multi-family rental properties, including data on property values, how their mortgages are financed, and characteristics of the structures.
""Given that one-in-five families rent apartments in these multifamily properties, it's critically important we broaden our understanding of how these developments are bought and paid for,"" said Erika Poethig, HUD's Deputy Assistant Secretary for Policy Development. ""The Rental Housing Finance Survey fills an important gap in our understanding of who owns multifamily rental housing - mostly individuals, not large companies -- and how multifamily rental housing is financed, especially as the structure of finance is changing. In light of recent changes in the availability of capital for rental housing, the Rental Housing Finance Survey also provides important insight about the financial health and stability of multifamily housing properties.""
This new survey builds on previously known information and collects data on property values of residential structures, characteristics of residential structures, rental status and rental value of units within the residential structures, commercial use of space within residential structures, property management status, ownership status, a detailed assessment of mortgage financing, and benefits received from Federal, state, local, and non-governmental programs.
HUD recognized that there was a gap in knowledge about who owns multifamily rental housing, how it is financed, and the financial health of the housing. The nation's recent housing crisis underscores the need to understand the financing that supports this important segment of the rental housing market, including the performance of the mortgages that support the housing in which one-in-five American families live.
With these data, HUD can gain a better understanding of multifamily rental loan origination volumes, property characteristics associated with these originations, and operating cost and revenue characteristics for the multifamily rental properties in the United States. The survey will play an important role in enabling the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) to fulfill its requirements to set affordable housing goals for the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) and to develop standards for underwriting multifamily mortgages. The data can be used to provide a statistically representative picture of multifamily financing and critical components of the national income accounts.
The 2012 Rental Housing Finance Survey was conducted in the winter and early spring of 2012 by the Census Bureau and includes information from detailed interviews of a nationally representative sample of 2,264 properties. Major findings from the Survey on multifamily rental properties include:
There are 2.3 million such properties in the United States. 73 percent are just one building while 4 percent have 20 or more buildings on the property. In multifamily rental properties with 50 or more units, 45 percent have 20 or more buildings. 77 percent provide parking. 19 percent contain buildings built prior to 1920. 67 percent are owned by households or individuals. 70 percent are managed day-to-day by the owner or an unpaid agent such as a family member. 54 percent of two to four unit multifamily rental properties have a mortgage compared to 85 percent of properties with over 50 units. 73 percent were acquired by their owners prior to 2005. 87 percent of multifamily properties owners reported making repairs to their housing units; the median cost of repairs was $699 per housing unit in 2011. 69 percent of all multifamily rental property owners reported making capital improvements to their properties in 2010 or 2011; then median cost of capital repairs was $1,167 per housing unit.

• 69 percent of all multifamily rental property owners reported making capital improvements to their properties in 2010 or 2011; then median cost of capital repairs was $1,167 per housing unit.
The survey provides a measure of financial, mortgage, and property characteristics of multifamily rental housing properties in the United States. The Survey also focuses on mortgage financing of multifamily rental housing properties, with emphasis on new purchase and refinancing transactions, and the characteristics of these new originations.
The rental apartment industry will be able to use the data to benchmark individual project performance against national data to help them make better business decisions.

These program designs can be adapted to a locality's unique needs and readily implemented so each community does not have to develop entire new programs on their own.
""Providing these ready-made programs to communities will help them get resources where they are needed more effectively and efficiently,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan, who also serves as Chair of the Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force. ""We are committed to working with our federal, state, local and tribal partners to get assistance to families who are struggling to rebuild as quickly as possible.""
The Disaster Relief Appropriations Act of 2013, signed into law by President Obama on January 29, included $16 billion in CDBG-DR funding. HUD announced the first allocation totaling $5.4 billion to five states and the City of New York eight days later. HUD will announce additional allocations in the coming months. HUD has worked closely with state and local partners to identify opportunities to expedite this assistance.
The model programs announced today cover three likely areas of need that communities would use CDBG-DR funding to meet:
Housing Rehabilitation (https://www.onecpd.info/resource/2853/cdbg-dr-toolkits/#HORehab): HUD has also developed a model of a program that would get CDBG-DR funds to homeowners to help them repair and rehabilitate their homes.
• Housing Rehabilitation (https://www.onecpd.info/resource/2853/cdbg-dr-toolkits/#HORehab): HUD has also developed a model of a program that would get CDBG-DR funds to homeowners to help them repair and rehabilitate their homes.
Housing Counseling: HUD is releasing a program guide that will support state and local governments using CDBG-DR funding to help affected homeowners connect with a reliable housing counselor in order to navigate the affordable options to rebuild, repair or relocate. More than 100 HUD-approved housing counseling agencies, with proper training and support, are available to help homeowners assess what they can afford, negotiate with insurance and mortgage companies, apply for affordable home repair loans and grants, and get their finances and their home stable and secure. With an investment of CDBG-DR funds, housing counselors would be able to provide this service free to homeowners and be an important safeguard against scammers that are unfortunately taking advantage of an already vulnerable population.

Housing Buyouts (https://www.onecpd.info/resource/2853/cdbg-dr-toolkits/#Buyout): Buying out homeowners in particularly flood-prone areas can be a cost-effective option to reduce future risk. The model program announced today reflects the potential importance of such programs and the need to ensure that any such process is locally driven.

These programs could be funded with the first round of CDBG-DR funding or with subsequent rounds and could be used by state, local and county governments applying for CDBG-DR funding. HUD has worked closely with a range of federal, state and local stakeholders to develop these programs and is committed to working with them as needed to help communities meet their unique needs."

04/03/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-047.cfm,HUD Announces Steps to Help End Avoidable Radon-Induced Lung Cancer Deaths in Housing,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has taken significant steps towards eliminating radon exposure in renter-occupied homes by issuing two new policies that will incorporate radon testing and mitigation into HUD programs to help prevent some of the estimated 21,000 lung cancer deaths radon causes in the United States every year.
HUD's Office of Multifamily Housing new policy requires radon testing and, if applicable, mitigation for most new FHA-insured construction, conversion and substantial rehabilitation projects, as well as most FHA-insured refinance transactions. Radon testing and mitigation is not required for refinance projects located in low risk areas, or if a certified Radon Professional determines that radon risk is sufficiently low for the project.
""We are confident that this policy will effectively mitigate the risks of radon exposure for residents of FHA-insured multifamily housing in a sensible and cost effective way,"" said Marie Head, Deputy Assistant Secretary of HUD's Office of Multifamily Housing Programs.
Radon is a priority of the Federal Radon Action Plan, developed by a federal government interagency team chaired by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ""This invisible air hazard in homes is preventable and there are straight-forward, low-cost solutions to protect families against radon risks,"" said Janet McCabe, EPA Principal Deputy Assistant Administrator for the Office of Air and Radiation. ""These new HUD policies will better protect thousands of Americans in the years ahead.""
The notice published by HUD's Office of Public and Indian Housing's informs Public Housing Agencies about the risks from radon exposure, and points out that the best way to mitigate radon is to prevent it from ever entering a building. The Notice strongly encourages Public Housing Agencies to proactively plan and complete radon testing and mitigation.
""Our radon policy is an important first step to raise awareness about the dangers of radon,"" noted Sandra B. Henriquez, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing. ""We look forward to continuing to examine additional ways that radon testing and mitigation can be incorporated into HUD's Public and Indian Housing programs.""
""These two HUD Offices have started a policy movement we hope all owners of multifamily housing will consider,"" said Jon L. Gant, Director of HUD's Office of Healthy Homes and Lead Hazard Control.

04/03/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-048.cfm,HUD Kicks Off Fair Housing Month with Launch of National Media Campaign,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the National Fair Housing Alliance (NFHA) today launched a national media campaign to educate the public and housing providers about their rights and responsibilities under the Fair Housing Act. The campaign, titled ""Fair Housing Is Your Right. Use It,"" includes English, Spanish, and Chinese radio and print public service advertisements (PSAs) that feature examples of actions which violate the Fair Housing Act and let the public know what to do if they experience housing discrimination. In addition to radio and print public service announcements, the campaign will use the latest digital and social media to amplify the outreach effort.
The launch of the campaign coincides with the beginning of Fair Housing Month when the nation marks the passage of the 1968 Fair Housing Act following the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The Fair Housing Act makes it illegal to discriminate in the sale or rental of housing based on race, color, sex, religion, national origin, familial status or disability. This year's Fair Housing Month theme is ""Our Work Today Defines Our Tomorrow,"" spotlighting HUD's current enforcement and education and outreach efforts and the work of its fair housing partners are helping to foster sustainable, inclusive communities of opportunity for future generations.
One of the campaign's print ads features a woman in a wheelchair and her service animal, drawing attention to persons with disabilities who often face housing discrimination. Another print ad featuring a woman wearing traditional Muslim headdress highlights the persistence of discrimination based on religion. Each PSA encourages anyone who experiences discrimination to call HUD's housing discrimination hotline (1-800-669-9777), contact a local fair housing agency, or visit HUD's fair housing Web site: www.HUD.gov/fairhousing.
""Forty-five years since the passage of the Fair Housing Act, unlawful discrimination continues to keep many individuals and families from obtaining the housing of their choice,"" said John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""The campaign being launched today will help HUD and our fair housing partners combat discrimination by arming the public with information about their fair housing rights and informing housing providers about their responsibilities under the law.""
""The National Fair Housing Alliance and HUD have a long history of working together to promote fair housing throughout this country,"" said Shanna L. Smith, President and CEO of the National Fair Housing Alliance. ""Those seeking to rent, own, buy or insure a home need ongoing education about their fair housing rights and how to take action if they suspect discrimination. We are pleased to have this opportunity to teach people that they have the power to fight housing discrimination and that contacting a local fair housing center or HUD is the first step in that process.""
In conjunction with the new PSA campaign, HUD and NFHA are also unveiling videos featuring people who experienced housing discrimination discussing how HUD or one of its partners provided assistance. One woman talks about how she was discriminated against because she was hard of hearing, while another shares her story of how a landlord denied her an apartment because she has children. These videos can be viewed on HUD's YouTube channel (http://youtu.be/Fz8uilHHcRA).
The campaign's PSAs will run in advertising space and in timeslots donated by the media. Radio PSAs, which can be tailored to include the contact information for a local fair housing organization, will be distributed to more than 3,500 radio stations and networks throughout the United States. Television PSAs will be released later this year.
In February, HUD launched the first housing discrimination mobile app for iPhone and iPad to provide the public with a quick and easy way to learn about their fair housing rights and to file housing discrimination complaints. As a complement to HUD's mobile app, NFHA released HTML 5 adaptive mobile pages, which are in English and Spanish and allow web content to display properly regardless of the brand of smartphone or tablet being used. In addition, the adaptive mobile pages allow individuals to complete and submit the fair housing complaint form in Spanish. HUD is designing a ""Quick Response code"" ad campaign that will direct mobile users to the new adaptive pages.
Copies of the campaign's PSAs can be obtained by going to www.HUD.gov/fairhousing or www.nationalfairhousing.org. Anyone who suspects that they are the victim of housing discrimination is encouraged to report it to HUD."

The latest data shows important progress across many key indicators—as home prices continue to show strong annual gains and purchases of new homes and sales of existing homes sustained their upward trajectory—although officials caution that the overall recovery remains fragile.The full Housing Scorecard is available online at www.hud.gov/scorecard.
""As the March housing scorecard indicates, the Obama Administration's efforts to speed housing recovery are continuing to show important signs of progress,"" said HUD Deputy Assistant Secretary for Economic Affairs Kurt Usowski. ""In 2012, homeowners' equity grew by more than $1.64 trillion and rising home values lifted 1.7 million of them back above water. Despite the positive news, we have important work ahead since there are so many families and individuals still struggling.""
""The Administration's programs continue to offer struggling homeowners some of the most sustainable relief available to prevent foreclosure,"" said Treasury Assistant Secretary for Financial Stability Tim Massad. ""These programs have paved the way for millions of additional families to get help with their mortgage payments while setting better standards for the mortgage industry.""
The March Housing Scorecard features key data on the health of the housing market and the impact of the Administration's foreclosure prevention programs, including:
Home prices showed large annual gains for the 12 months ending January 2013 and purchases of new homes and sales of existing homes continued to strengthen. The FHFA purchase-only index was up 6.5 percent from one year ago and the Case-Shiller 20-city index was up 8.1 percent over the same period. Purchases of new homes in February 2013 were up 12 percent from one year ago, the second highest level since April 2010. February sales of existing homes were up 10 percent over the same period, the highest since November 2009, when the First-Time Home Buyer Tax Credit was in effect. The Administration's foreclosure mitigation programs are providing relief for millions of homeowners as we continue to recover from an unprecedented housing crisis. More than 1.5 million homeowner assistance actions have taken place through the Making Home Affordable Program, including more than 1.1 million permanent modifications through the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP), while the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) has offered more than 1.7 million loss mitigation and early delinquency interventions. The Administration's programs continue to encourage improved standards and processes in the industry, with HOPE Now lenders offering families and individuals nearly 3.5 million proprietary mortgage modifications through January. HAMP continues to offer homeowners affordable and sustainable relief to avoid foreclosure. As of February, more than 1.1 million homeowners have received a permanent modification through HAMP saving approximately $546 on their mortgage payments each month, and an estimated $18.5 billion to date. In February, 70 percent of homeowners with eligible non-GSE mortgages benefitted from principal reduction with their HAMP modification. Homeowners currently in permanent HAMP modifications have been granted an estimated $9.6 billion in total principal reduction.

04/10/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-050.cfm,Donovan Announces HUD's 2014 Budget,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan today released details of the Obama Administration's proposed Fiscal Year 2014 HUD Budget, a plan that seeks to protect the rental housing and homeless assistance for millions of extremely poor Americans while increasing investments in key initiatives to serve some of the nation's most distressed neighborhoods.
""The President understands that in today's budget climate, we can't build ladders of opportunity on a mountain of debt,"" said Donovan. ""As we work to strengthen our nation's housing markets, we can't lose sight of our commitment to house and serve millions of extremely low-income families who live on the margins of our economy.""
HUD's budget is built on a number of principles outlined in the President's State of the Union address:
Growing the Middle Class While Bringing Private Capital Bank to the Market - by reigniting economic growth by strengthening the housing market, speeding the nation's economic recovery, and building a stronger middle class Prioritizing Renewals - by maintaining a core commitment to protect families currently receiving rental assistance by keeping them in their home Creating Ladders of Opportunity for Millions of Americans - by creating Promise Zones in some of the nation's hardest-hit neighborhoods Reducing Regulatory Burdens and Increasing Efficiency - by improving the efficiency and effectiveness of HUD programs
• Growing the Middle Class While Bringing Private Capital Bank to the Market - by reigniting economic growth by strengthening the housing market, speeding the nation's economic recovery, and building a stronger middle class
• Prioritizing Renewals - by maintaining a core commitment to protect families currently receiving rental assistance by keeping them in their home
• Creating Ladders of Opportunity for Millions of Americans - by creating Promise Zones in some of the nation's hardest-hit neighborhoods
• Reducing Regulatory Burdens and Increasing Efficiency - by improving the efficiency and effectiveness of HUD programs
HUD's proposed 2014 budget provides $47.6 billion, an increase of $4.2 billion or 9.7 percent above the 2012 enacted level. More than 90 percent of this funding increase is used to maintain current levels of rental and homelessness assistance for vulnerable families, the overwhelming majority of whom earn less than 30 percent of their area's median income. The Budget also makes investments to revitalize high-poverty neighborhoods, reduce blight in communities hardest hit by the foreclosure crisis, and support sustainable economic development. Savings are achieved through reduced funding for new affordable housing construction and reforms to the Department's rental assistance programs that do not reduce the number of families served.
HUD's 2014 Budget request includes:
$37.4 billion to provide rental housing assistance to 5.4 million low-income families; Nearly $2.4 billion in homeless assistance grants through HUD's Continuum of Care and Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG); 10,000 new rental vouchers through the HUD-VA Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) Program to provide permanent housing to homeless veterans; $400 million for HUD's Choice Neighborhoods Initiative totransform 30 neighborhoods with extreme poverty into opportunity-rich, mixed-income neighborhoods. To date, the nine communities currently funded under this initiative leveraged $2 billion in other sources of capital, more than eight times their grant awards; Expands the Moving to Work Program to test innovative, locally driven policies to achieve positive outcomes for families, streamline program administration, and reduce Federal costs. To build evidence of what works, this expansion is accompanied by rigorous reporting and evaluation requirements; A combined $526 million to sustain rental assistance and produce an estimated 4,100 new supportive housing units through HUD's Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly Program and Section 811 Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities Program $726 million to address the housing needs of Native American Tribes; $332 million for a modernized Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) program that will target funds to areas with the highest need; Reduces funding for the HOME Investment Partnerships Program. The Budget mitigates this reduction by providing $1 billion to capitalize the Housing Trust Fund to expand the supply of housing targeted to extremely low income families; and Reduces costs in HUD's core Rental Assistance programs by simplifying administration of the medical expense deduction, better targeting rental assistance to the working poor, and setting more equitable Public Housing rents.

04/12/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-051.cfm,Donovan Announces Expanded Efforts to Help Homeowners Impacted by Hurricane Sandy,"WASHINGTON - In an effort to expand relief to homeowners impacted by Hurricane Sandy, U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan, who also chairs the Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force, today announced a series of additional measures to allow families to get back on their feet without having to face the prospect of foreclosure.
""As we work to rebuild entire neighborhoods, we can't forget that homeowners need some breathing room as they put their lives back together,"" said Donovan. ""We recognize that families need relief, and by offering expanded forbearance and streamlined loan modifications, FHA is working to provide homeowners with an affordable and permanent mortgage solution.""
In the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, FHA, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac put in place foreclosure and eviction moratoriums on the initiation or commencement of foreclosure actions against homeowners whose properties were damaged or destroyed due to Hurricane Sandy. In January they extended the moratoriums, which apply to homeowners in Presidentially Declared Major Disaster Areas eligible for individual assistance, through April 30, 2013.
The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) has already instructed FHA-approved lenders to make every effort to communicate with and assist affected borrowers in rebuilding or repairing damaged properties, minimizing delinquencies and retaining their homes.
In addition to relief offered through HUD's Loss Mitigation Program, today, FHA is expanding forbearance relief for affected borrowers. Under this policy:
Borrowers may suspend up to 12 months' worth of mortgage payments while they repair their homes; and After the forbearance period, borrowers may be eligible for an FHA streamlined loan modification to avoid large lump sum payments.
• Borrowers may suspend up to 12 months' worth of mortgage payments while they repair their homes; and
• After the forbearance period, borrowers may be eligible for an FHA streamlined loan modification to avoid large lump sum payments.
Up to 285,922 borrowers in the Sandy-affected areas who were eligible for forbearance relief as of February 28, 2013, may be eligible for an FHA streamlined modification.
This new loss mitigation option aligns with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the Enterprises) to provide borrowers coming out of forbearance a streamlined loan modification that will not require a financial assessment. FHA recognizes that borrowers who were current at the time of the disaster should be provided an expedient means of transitioning out of forbearance into a permanent mortgage solution.

The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in rental or sales transactions based on disability, including preventing a home sale because the home is going to be used by persons with disabilities.
""HUD is committed to promoting housing opportunities for people with disabilities in mainstream settings,"" said John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""We're pleased the parties in this case were willing to resolve this matter in a way that advances that goal.""
HUD General Counsel Helen Kanovsky added, ""This case emphasizes that no one is above the law. Sellers of property, as well as their real estate agents and law firms who assist them, are all required to adhere to the Fair Housing Act.""
The prospective buyer planned to rent the house to a non-profit organization that provides supportive housing for persons with disabilities. When Erwin Miller, the executor of the estate learned the house would be used as a rental property, he agreed to sell the home on the condition a restrictive covenant was attached to the property. Miller stated in an email, ""If they rent to a responsible family it is okay, BUT no unrelated individuals, students, dorm! Neighbors will fight this."" Donna Truex, Miller's attorney, at Bowditch & Dewey, LLP, recorded a restrictive covenant prohibiting the use of the house as a group home for disabled persons. Miller's real estate agent, an independent contractor associated with Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage, then emailed the restrictive covenant to the prospective purchaser's sales agent, thereby prompting the prospective purchaser to withdraw from the sale.
The prospective purchaser and his sales agent subsequently filed a complaint with HUD, alleging the restrictive covenant that prohibited future owners of the home from using it as a group home for individuals with disabilities. After receiving the complaint, HUD filed its own Secretary-initiated housing discrimination complaint alleging that the actions of the seller, real estate agent Maureen Kelleher, and attorney Donna Truex violated the Fair Housing Act.
Under the terms of the agreement, which was negotiated by HUD's Regional Counsel in Boston, Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage and Bowditch & Dewey will each pay $39,000 to the prospective buyer and $6,000 to his sales agent. Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage and Bowditch & Dewey, LLP, will provide their employees with fair housing training. In addition, Bowditch & Dewey, LLP, will donate 100 hours of free legal services directly related to fair housing and 100 hours of free legal services directly related to the promotion of disability rights."

The winner of the $25,000 prize was Reston, Va.-based Qbase, which developed ""Homeless REACH."" VA's Center for Innovation (VACI) sponsored the competition, called Project REACH (Real-time Electronic Access for Caregivers and Homeless), in collaboration with the Jon Bon Jovi Soul Foundation and the Departments of Housing and Urban Development and Health and Human Services.
""This contest tapped into a community of software developers who rose to the challenge to use mobile and information technology in support of our mission - to better serve Veterans,"" said Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric K. Shinseki. ""The result is a robust and scalable tool for caregivers, social workers, and anyone who wants to help homeless Veterans access the support and physical care they need.""
The Obama Administration has made ending Veteran homelessness by the end of 2015 a top priority, undertaking an unprecedented campaign partnering with HUD and hundreds of community organizations to dramatically increase awareness of VA services available for homeless Veterans and Veterans at risk of becoming homeless. This cooperation has helped reduce the estimated number of homeless Veterans living on our streets by nearly 17 percent, since 2009.
""We've come to rely on smart phones and tablets to access information and now we can apply this same technology to help people find a place to sleep or direct them to medical and other vital services,"" said Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Shaun Donovan. ""This mobile app represents another high-impact collaboration between HUD, VA, and key partners in our shared effort to end Veteran homelessness in 2015.""
Project REACH sought creative and cost-efficient ways to use open data from VA, other government agencies and the private sector to locate valuable resources for the homeless in any locality across the country.
VA and its partners announced the five finalists at Health Datapalooza in Washington, D.C. on June 5, 2012. They were: Binary Group, Arlington, Va., who developed ""Homeless Connections; John McCarthy, Forest Hills, N.Y., with ""Reachous""; J.J.AppCo., with ""Hero""; Makani Kai Tech, of Kihei, Hawaii, with ""Help Beacon""; and Qbase's app. The finalists were given time to improve their apps based on feedback from beta testers volunteering at Soul Kitchen in Red Bank, N.J.
""The origins of Project REACH stemmed from the visible need for a simple, user-friendly, comprehensive application that would allow us to direct our Soul Kitchen diners to other resources in the community. Thanks to the VA, HUD, HHS and the contest participants, we now have the application 'Homeless REACH' which will aid resource providers and communities around the country in helping those in need,"" said Jon Bon Jovi, musician and Chairman of the JBJ Soul Foundation.
""VA appreciates the great work of our partners in the project and the commitment made by talented people to address one of the nation's most important challenges,"" said Jonah Czerwinski, director of VACI. ""This will make a big difference in the lives of people who need help.""
""Homeless REACH"" received the highest score from judges who evaluated the five finalist submissions based on factors such as sustainability, scalability and completeness of information made available to people helping Veterans and others experiencing homelessness. The winning app provides easy access to essential information about health care, housing, employment and counseling, among other vital services, through the use of advanced mobile technology. ""Homeless REACH"" can be downloaded for free through the Android Market and the App Store.
All five of the mobile app finalists created under Project REACH are available for download at www.innovation.va.gov/program-reach.html"

In a letter to HACC President of the Board of Commissioners Bruce Tate Jr., HUD cited the agency for violating federal law and defaulting on its Public Housing Annual Contributions Contract (ACC) - the agreement that local housing authorities enter into with the federal government to administer HUD's public housing programs. The major findings are:
Misuse of federal funds on non-ACC projects - An independent auditor found that HACC improperly used $1,301,523 of HUD funds for unauthorized pre-development and development expenses, which is a violation of the Annual Contributions Contract. Violations of the Memorandum of Understanding - In the three years since HACC entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with HUD in March 2010, the Executive Director of HACC has not adopted corrective measures to address the problem, nor has the Board of Commissioners demanded action to resolve these issues despite HUD's repeated attempts to stabilize the agency.

Over the last two years, HUD has worked with the HACC Board of Commissioners to resolve the issues, including the repayment of the $1.3 million which is supposed to be used to house elderly and disabled families of Brevard County under the Housing Choice Voucher program. HACC has the funds available. An official letter from HUD was sent to the Board of Commissioners in January 2012 stating that HACC was in violation of the Memorandum of Understanding and would need to repay the funds to enable the Brevard County families to be housed. The Board's failure to act, even following a 10 day cure period, resulted in this action.
Assistant Secretary Sandra B. Henriquez said, ""Taking a housing authority over is an act of last resort. We hope to quickly resolve the issues at the Cocoa Housing Authority so that we can begin the process of returning the agency to local control.""
Henriquez named Karen Jackson Sims, who has been with HUD for 15 years, as the recovery administrator to manage HACC's day-to-day operations."
04/24/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-054.cfm,HUD Announces Major Restructuring of Field Offices,"
WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today announced a series of restructuring and systemic changes within its Office of Multifamily Housing Programs and the Office of Field Policy and Management (FPM). The changes, which include consolidating Multifamily hubs nationwide and closing 16 smaller offices, affect approximately 900 of the Departments' 9,000 employees. Read more about HUD's restructuring plans on HUD's website.
While implementation will begin this fall, completion of the entire restructuring process is expected to take approximately two and a half years. Throughout implementation, HUD leadership will work on an ongoing basis to ensure employees are fully informed, and that all notification requirements for both union and non-union workers are satisfied. Every affected employee will be offered the opportunity to continue working for HUD, though in some cases in a new location or role.
""The current organizational model for HUD is not sustainable from a financial and a service delivery point of view,"" said Maurice Jones, HUD's Deputy Secretary. ""We are reviewing every aspect of our operation to determine if we have the right people in the right places and we're determining where we can be even more efficient, to get the most value out of our limited resources. We're in a different budget environment and we're at a point where we must make some extremely tough choices. That being said, we certainly understand that this type of change can be challenging for the agency's employees and we are committed to moving forward on the plan in a way that is sensitive to the needs and concerns of HUD's staff.""
HUD's Multifamily Office providesmortgage insurance to HUD-approved lenders to facilitate the construction, substantial rehabilitation, purchase and refinancing of multifamily housing projects as well as administering a number of project-based rental assistance programs.The office's restructuring plan, scheduled to begin this fall, will be fully implemented by 2016. This plan involves streamlining Multifamily's organization in both headquarters and the field, plus implementing several operational improvements. In addition to improving program effectiveness, Multifamily estimates that the plan will generate up to $40-45 million in annual savings once implementation is complete.
A key component of the Multifamily plan will be consolidating its field employees, who currently work in 50 offices around the country, into ten offices that will report to five Multifamily Hubs. These Hubs will be located in New York, Atlanta, Chicago, Fort Worth, and San Francisco, with satellite offices in Boston, Jacksonville, Detroit, Kansas City, and Denver. This more streamlined model will allow more consistent, efficient processing of loans and servicing of existing assets. Combined with operational improvements in line with industry standards, these changes willhelp ensure continued high quality work that creates and protects affordable rental housing opportunities.
""Multifamily is one of HUD's core programs, and this is its first major restructuring since 1998,"" said Marie Head, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Multifamily Housing Programs. ""We have to change in order to be nimble and keep pace with the marketplace by leveraging technology, reducing our footprint as appropriate, and enhancing customer service in ways that will help ensure that we perform as a 21st century institution. In today's budget climate, we must also look for every opportunity to increase our operating efficiency, but we also have to keep in mind the impact of these changes on our employees. We will be doing all we can to move forward on the plan in a way that offers workers as much flexibility as possible.""
HUD's Office of Field Policy and Management is also managing towards the future. It is closing 16 of its 80 field offices this year in a cost-cutting move that is estimated to save the agency between $110 and $150 million over a 10-year period. The closures, which are expected to be completed early in fiscal year 2014, will affect approximately 120 employees.
The small offices that are closing are located in Camden, New Jersey; Syracuse, New York;Orlando, Florida; Tampa, Florida; Springfield, Illinois; Cincinnati, Ohio; Flint, Michigan; Grand Rapids; Michigan; Shreveport, Louisiana; Dallas, Texas; Lubbock, Texas; Tucson, Arizona; Fresno, California, Sacramento; California; San Diego, California and Spokane, Washington. HUD will retain at least one office in each state. Following the closures, several affected states will still retain more than one office, including California, Texas and New York with three offices each, and Florida and Ohio with two each.
""We looked at where our staffs are and where they need to be in order to make certain we can achieve the greatest possible impact on the people and the places we serve, especially given today's tough fiscal climate"" said Pat Hoban-Moore, HUD's Assistant Deputy Secretary for Field Policy and Management. ""We can implement this realignment while still serving communities throughout the nation, effectively and efficiently. In addition, we will be focused on making sure staffs in the affected offices have full information on all of their options.""
By closing these offices and undertaking this restructuring, HUD is striving to balance budget reductions and increasing workloads while continuing to focus on giving the agency's staff the tools necessary to provide high quality service from the remaining office locations.
All employees affected by both the Multifamily restructuring and the Field Policy Management office closings will be eligible for relocation assistance, or they can elect to take voluntary separation incentive pay or voluntary early retirement. Every employee is being offered a position with the agency.
""The most difficult part of implementing these changes is the appreciation of the very personal impact they have on employees who have dedicated years of their life to the mission of HUD,"" said Deputy Secretary Jones. ""Realistically, there is no way to make the kind of structural changes we are talking about without there being some impact on our staff, but, again, we are committed to taking all necessary steps to reduce the negative impact they will feel."""
04/26/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-056.cfm,Secretary Donovan and Governor Cuomo Announce Approval of New York State's Disaster Recovery Plan,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Shaun Donovan today announced federal approval of New York State's recovery action plan to help homeowners and businesses following Superstorm Sandy, Hurricane Irene, and Tropical Storm Lee. Funded through HUD's Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery (CDBG - DR) program, New York State's recovery action plan calls for a combined $1.7 billion investment in a variety of housing, infrastructure and business recovery activities. Read New York State's action plan here www.nyshcr.org/Publications/CDBGActionPlan.pdf.
""Today we take another important step toward recovery and healing for hard-hit communities in New York,"" said Donovan. ""We've worked closely with Governor Cuomo, Senators Schumer and Gillibrand and the New York Congressional Delegation throughout the entire process to help design effective programs that will help families get back in their homes, jumpstart local economies and make communities more resilient as quickly as possible. We have also imposed additional internal controls and accountability measures and we will be working with the Inspector General to ensure that all funds are used as intended – to help families, small businesses and communities get back on their feet and rebuild.""
Governor Andrew M. Cuomo said, ""Following the devastation caused by the major storms to hit New York over the past two years, our state worked closely together with our Congressional Delegation and local communities to put together a comprehensive action plan to help our homeowners and businesses recover and rebuild. Today's announcement is a tremendous boost of support for homeowners, businesses, and local governments that lost so much in Superstorm Sandy but it is not the end of the road for our recovery. Secretary Donovan has been a great partner thus far and I look forward to continuing to work together as we build our state back better, stronger than ever before.""
Senator Charles E. Schumer said, ""Now that this plan is approved, desperately needed dollars can start flowing to the homeowners and business owners who lost so much. It is a turning point in our recovery from the storm, but our work won't be done until houses are totally rebuilt, businesses are reopen, and roads, bridges, schools and other infrastructure has been repaired, stronger than it was before.""
On January 29th, President Obama signed the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013 into law, providing a total of $16 billion in CDBG Disaster Recovery funding. HUD quickly allocated $5.4 billion to five states (including New York) and New York City. New York State submitted its required action plan describing how the funds will be used on April 3rd and HUD conducted an expedited review to enable New York State to access these funds as quickly as possible.
The CDBG Disaster Recovery funding gives grantees significant flexibility in determining how best to use their funds to meet the greatest unmet needs. In general, the funds are intended for the restoration of housing and infrastructure as well as economic revitalization in disaster-impacted areas. The funds are to meet recovery needs that are not otherwise covered by other federal assistance, private insurance, or other sources.
New York State's approach will focus principally on meeting the immediate recovery needs for housing and business assistance in the communities affected by Hurricane Sandy. These activities include $838 million to support a variety of housing programs and $415 million to assist economic revitalization programs.

""We are here today because of the untiring efforts of HUD's receivership team, in particular Estelle Richman, and a new management team at PHA to restore the credibility of this agency for the citizens of Philadelphia,"" said Henriquez. ""It's a great day for the City, the housing authority, HUD, and most importantly, the residents who rely on the housing and services PHA provides.""
In a ceremony at the housing authority's board meeting today, Henriquez presented a declaration to the City releasing PHA from federal control. Joining Henriquez was Suzanne Biemiller, First Deputy Chief of Staff to Mayor Michael Nutter, former HUD Senior Advisor Estelle Richman, who served as Chairman of the PHA Board during the receivership, and PHA President and CEO Kelvin Jeremiah.
""I want to thank U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan, Assistant Secretary Sandra Henriquez and Estelle Richman, the Secretary's senior advisor who acted as PHA's sole board member through this time of transition. I deeply appreciate their cooperation and support. Now, with PHA's return to local control, the City of Philadelphia has the opportunity to better coordinate housing policy, related investment decisions and neighborhood revitalization in a transparent and coherent manner that involves all housing agencies and stakeholders for the benefit of the people who live in PHA housing and all Philadelphians,"" said Mayor Michael A. Nutter. ""Equally important, the re-establishment of local control with a new governance structure means real accountability. The Authority in all its actions is responsible to the Mayor who, in turn, is answerable to the voters. This significant reform could not have been achieved without the strong support of the Philadelphia City Council, the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, the Pennsylvania Senate and Gov. Corbett. Under PHA President Kelvin Jeremiah's leadership, PHA has instituted strong internal controls, and now with a talented PHA Board of Commissioners prepared to carry out its duties, a new era of accountability, responsibility and transparency begins that will benefit PHA residents and staff and all Philadelphians.""
""I take pride and pleasure in having this opportunity to leave this agency with the team we have in place,"" said Richman. ""The time has come for HUD to step aside and allow this agency to continue the progress it has made independent of the federal government.""
""Thanks to the collective leadership and the support of HUD, Mayor Nutter and Council President Darrell Clarke, PHA is ready to revert to local control after more than two years in receivership. This, along with strong internal controls, an experienced executive staff and a dedicated board, has truly equipped the agency to operate efficiently and effectively for years to come."" said Jeremiah. ""I believe this committed board, with its wide range of experiences in the community, can govern the agency in a thoughtful and highly ethical manner. Today marks an important achievement for PHA and its staff. We are no longer looking to the past with regret and disappointment. Instead, we are looking forward to the future, to seize the opportunities it holds, and to take back PHA's good name and reclaim its legacy.""
HUD took over PHA in March 2011 and named Richman PHA Board Chair to oversee operations of the agency as the one-member Board. A new management team was put in place and successfully established policies and procedures that moved the agency forward that restored credibility to the agency.
Over the last two years, PHA has put in place stricter internal controls, a stronger management structure, and a robust audit and compliance department. The agency also has a fully functional Human Resources Department and Office of General Counsel. The Human Resources staff has trained all employees on the rules of engagement, including, but not limited to, standards of ethical conduct and Equal Employment Opportunity policies.
In 2012, the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed a measure to increase the number of board members from five to nine and gave the Mayor the authority to appoint all Commissioners with City Council approval. Two of the Commissioners are PHA residents. In the same year, Mayor Nutter appointed the following individuals to serve on the PHA Board of Commissioners: Lynette M. Brown-Sow, Vice President of Marketing and Communications Community College of Philadelphia; Leslie D. Callahan, PhD, Pastor of St. Paul's Baptist Church in North Philadelphia; Rev. Bonnie Camarda, Director of Partnerships for the Salvation Army of Eastern Pennsylvania and Delaware; Hon. Nelson A. Diaz, partner at Dilworth Paxson, LLP; Shellie R. Jackson, PHA resident; Joan Markman, Esq., Chief Integrity Officer for the City of Philadelphia; Kenneth A. Murphy, Esq. partner at Drinker Biddle & Reath, LLP; Vernell Tate, PHA resident and president of the resident council at Spring Garden Apartments; Herbert Wetzel, former Executive Director of the Redevelopment Authority, housing expert for the Philadelphia City Council.
The new board, which over the past few months have attended board and residents meetings, has received extensive training from PHA and HUD, including sessions on Ethical Conduct, Conflict of Interest, EEO and the Fair Housing Act. Last month, Richman appointed Jeremiah, an expert in compliance and investigations, the president and CEO of PHA."
04/29/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-057.cfm,Secretary Donovan and Governor Christie Announce Approval of New Jersey's Disaster Recovery Plan,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Shaun Donovan today announced HUD's approval of New Jersey's disaster recovery plan to help homeowners and businesses following Hurricane Sandy. Funded through HUD's Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program, New Jersey's action plan calls for a $1.83 billion investment to support a variety of housing, infrastructure and business activities. Read New Jersey's disaster recovery plan (www.state.nj.us/dca/divisions/sandyassistance.html).
Donovan, who also chairs President Obama's Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force, said today's approval will allow the State to begin the long-term process of rebuilding damaged housing, restoring infrastructure, and stimulating business activity and job growth.
""Today we take another important step toward recovery and healing for hard-hit communities in New Jersey,"" said Donovan. ""HUD has worked closely with Governor Christie, Senators Menendez and Lautenberg, and the New Jersey Congressional Delegation to help design effective programs that will help small businesses reopen, get families back in their homes make communities more resilient as quickly as possible. We have also imposed additional internal controls and accountability measures and we will be working with the Inspector General to ensure that all funds are used as intended - to help families, small businesses and communities get back on their feet and rebuild.""
""Today's news sends a very powerful message that New Jersey is moving forward and that the Jersey Shore will be open for business this summer,"" said Governor Chris Christie. ""These funds will provide critical resources to our Sandy-impacted homeowners and businesses to reconstruct, rehabilitate and continue down the road of recovery. While there is much work ahead of us, we have come a long way during these last six months, and I want to thank Secretary Donovan and his team for their tireless efforts as we all work together to rebuild our great state.""
""This infusion of federal funding will help New Jersey continue to recover from Superstorm Sandy and ensure that our state is rebuilt stronger and better prepared for future storms. Families that are rebuilding their homes, small businesses that are getting back on their feet, and communities that are repairing damaged public infrastructure will all benefit from this federal grant program,"" Senator Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ) said. ""We worked hard to get this funding flowing into New Jersey, and we will continue working with the State to ensure we receive the assistance necessary to fully recover from Superstorm Sandy.""
""This CDBG funding will help elevate homes to avoid future floods, provide grants for hard hit small businesses that cannot take on more debt, and help the Jersey Shore rebuild for tourism season,"" said Senator Robert Menendez (D-NJ). ""It is gratifying to see state, federal, and local partners come together to create a strong plan for our recovery. I look forward to continuing to work with all stakeholders to rebuild New Jersey better and stronger than ever.""
""HUD's approval of New Jersey's Disaster Recovery Plan will provide much needed funding to help Sandy victims rebuild their homes and businesses,"" said Congressman Frank Pallone (NJ-06). ""This is a critical step in the path toward recovery, but we still have a long road ahead. As residents and businesses continue to do the hard work of restoring what Sandy destroyed, I remain committed to making sure that our needs are being met and New Jerseyans have the tools we need to rebuild our communities even better than they were before the storm.""
On January 29th, President Obama signed the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act of 2013 into law, providing a total of $16 billion in CDBG Disaster Recovery funding. HUD quickly allocated $5.4 billion to five states (including New Jersey) and New York City. New Jersey submitted its required action plan describing how the funds will be used on March 27th and HUD conducted an expedited review to enable the state to access these funds as quickly as possible.
CDBG Disaster Recovery funding gives grantees significant flexibility in determining how best to use their funds to meet the greatest unmet needs. In general, the funds are intended for the restoration of housing and infrastructure as well as economic revitalization in disaster-impacted areas. The funds are to meet recovery needs that are not otherwise covered by other federal assistance, private insurance, or other sources.
The New Jersey plan offers a range of programs to provide relief to homeowners of damaged or destroyed properties as well as grants and low-cost loans to eligible small businesses. These programs provide more than $1 billion in various housing programs; $200 million for economic revitalization; and $225 million for infrastructure and public service programs.

04/30/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-055.cfm,"HUD, DOJ Release New Guidance on ""Design and Construction"" Requirements Under the Fair Housing Act","WASHINGTON - New guidance released today by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) reinforces the Fair Housing Act requirement that multifamily housing be designed and constructed so that it is accessible to persons with disabilities. Read HUD and DOJ's new guidance.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in housing based on disability, race, color, national origin, religion, sex and familial status. The Fair Housing Act also requires that multifamily housing built for first occupancy after March 1991 contain accessible features for persons with disabilities.
The new guidance is designed to assist design professionals, developers and builders in understanding and meeting their obligations and to assist persons with disabilities in understanding their rights regarding the ""design and construction"" requirements of the federal Fair Housing Act.
""Everyone who is involved in designing and building multifamily housing must ensure that the required accessible features are present so that people with disabilities can use and enjoy their homes,"" said Eric Halperin, Senior Counsel and Special Counsel for Fair Lending in the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division. ""This guidance will help design professionals and builders understand their obligations under this important component of the Fair Housing Act.""
""Today, more than 30 million Americans use a wheelchair or have difficulty walking or climbing stairs and they have every right to live in housing that is accessible to them,"" stated John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""This new guidance promotes access and helps developers construct housing that complies with the Fair Housing Act from the start so they don't have to retrofit later.""
HUD and DOJ share responsibility for enforcing the federal Fair Housing Act. HUD is the agency with the primary responsibility for investigatingindividual complaints of discrimination. The Secretary of HUD, on his own initiative, may also file complaints alleging discrimination. The Attorney General may commence a civil action in federal court when there is reasonable cause to believe that someone is engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination or that a group of persons has been denied rights protected by the Act.
Under the Act, housing built for first occupancy after March 1991 must include:
Public and common use areas that are readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities; Doors that are designed to allow passage into and within all premises of covered dwellings and that are sufficiently wide to allow passage by persons with disabilities, including persons who use wheelchairs; An accessible route into and through the dwelling unit; Light switches, electrical outlets, thermostats, and other environmental controls in accessible locations; Reinforcements in bathroom walls to allow the later installation of grab bars; and Usable kitchens and bathrooms such that an individual using a wheelchair can maneuver about and use the space.
• Public and common use areas that are readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities;
• Doors that are designed to allow passage into and within all premises of covered dwellings and that are sufficiently wide to allow passage by persons with disabilities, including persons who use wheelchairs;
• An accessible route into and through the dwelling unit;
• Light switches, electrical outlets, thermostats, and other environmental controls in accessible locations;
• Reinforcements in bathroom walls to allow the later installation of grab bars; and
• Usable kitchens and bathrooms such that an individual using a wheelchair can maneuver about and use the space.
Since January 2009, HUD and its Fair Housing Assistance Program partners have investigated and either conciliated or charged 300 cases that alleged violations of the design and construction requirements of the Fair Housing Act. The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division has filed 141 cases to enforce the Fair Housing Act since January 2009, 19 of which have alleged discrimination based on a failure to design and construct multifamily housing in compliance with the Act.

04/30/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-060.cfm,HUD Issues Notice on Assistance Animals and Reasonable Accommodations for Persons with Disabilities,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today issued a Notice reaffirming that housing providers must provide reasonable accommodations to persons with disabilities who require assistance animals. The ""Notice on Service Animals and Assistance Animals for People with Disabilities in Housing and HUD-Funded Programs"" discusses how the Fair Housing Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) intersect regarding the use of service or assistance animals by persons with disabilities.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits landlords from discriminating based on disability, race, color, national origin, religion, sex, and familial status. The ADA (http://www.dol.gov/cgi-bin/leave-dol.asp?exiturl=http://www.ada.gov/&exitTitle=The_Americans_with_Disabilities_Act&fedpage=yes) prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in employment, transportation, public accommodations, communications, and state and local government activities. Both laws contain provisions which address the use of service or assistance animals by people with disabilities. While the Fair Housing Act covers nearly all types of housing, some types of housing, such as public housing, are covered by both laws.
""The vital importance of assistance animals in reducing barriers, promoting independence, and improving the quality of life for people with disabilities should not be underestimated, particularly in the home,"" said John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Disability-related complaints, including those that involve assistance animals, are the most common discrimination complaint we receive. This notice will help housing providers better understand and meet their obligation to grant reasonable accommodations to people with disabilities that require assistance animals to fully use and enjoy their housing.""
HUD's new notice explains housing providers' obligations under the Fair Housing Act, including the requirement to provide reasonable accommodations to people with disabilities who require assistance animals. Pet restrictions cannot be used to deny or limit housing to people with disabilities who require the use of an assistance animal because of their disability. Housing providers must grant reasonable accommodations in such instances, in accordance with the law. The guidance also describes the Department of Justice's revised definition of ""service animal"" under the ADA, as well as housing providers' obligations when multiple nondiscrimination laws apply.
The Americans with Disabilities Act requires equal access for people with disabilities using trained service dogs in public accommodations and government facilities. Under the Fair Housing Act, housing providers have a further obligation to accommodate people with disabilities who, because of their disability, require trained service dogs or other types of assistance animals to perform tasks, provide emotional support, or alleviate the effects of their disabilities.
HUD's and the Department of Justice's Joint Statement on Reasonable Accommodations provides additional information regarding housing providers' obligations to provide reasonable accommodations. The Department of Justice has also published a fact sheet (www.ada.gov/service_animals_2010.htm) on service animals and the ADA.

04/30/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-061.cfm,"HUD, Utah Mortgage Company Settle Pregnancy Discrimination Claim","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has reached a Conciliation Agreement with Primary Residential Mortgage, Inc. (PRMI), in Salt Lake City, UT, settling allegations that the lender denied a Baltimore, Maryland woman a mortgage loan because she was pregnant and on maternity leave.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in the sale, rental, and financing of dwellings, and in other housing-related transactions, based on sex, race, color, national origin, religion, familial status, or disability. Refusing to approve a mortgage loan or to provide refinancing because a woman is pregnant or on maternity leave violates the Fair Housing Act's prohibitions against sex and familial status discrimination.
""Lenders have many legitimate business related reasons to deny a mortgage loan, but a woman's maternity status is not one of them,"" stated John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will continue to take action against lenders who refuse to make loans to otherwise qualified women merely because they are pregnant or on maternity leave.""
The woman, who applied for the loan in her name, and her husband filed a complaint with HUD alleging discrimination after one of PRMI's loan officers told her that she was a ""good risk"" and that the lender would be willing to finance her loan, but only after she returned to work. After being unable to get a loan from PRMI, the woman and her husband applied for a loan with another lender and were approved.
Under the terms of the agreement, PRMI will pay the woman $13,000 and adopt a parental leave policy with respect to loan applications to ensure compliance with the fair lending requirements of the Fair Housing Act. In addition, PRMI's loan officers, processors, underwriters and decision makers will be trained on the Act and the new policy. The Parental Leave Policy applies to men as well as women who are on parental leave due to the birth or adoption of a child and prohibits inquiries concerning a person's future parental leave plans.
Persons who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY).

05/02/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-062.cfm,Obama Administration Renews Support for More Than 500 Local Homeless Programs Across the U.S.,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Shaun Donovan today announced a second round of grants for more than 500 local homeless housing and service programs across the U.S, provided through HUD's Continuum of Care Program. This year, HUD challenged local communities to reexamine their response to homelessness and give greater weight to proven strategies, from providing 'rapid re-housing' for homeless families to permanent supportive housing for those experiencing chronic homelessness (see attached chart).
The $72 million in grants announced today support a wide range of programs including street outreach, client assessment, and direct housing assistance. In March, HUD awarded more than $1.5 billion in a first round of grant funding to renew support for more than 7,000 other local programs. HUD will make a third round of funding to support selected new projects later this year. View a complete list of all the state and local homeless projects awarded funding on HUD's website.
""We know these modest investments in housing and serving our homeless neighbors not only saves money, but saves lives,"" said Donovan. ""These local programs are on the front lines of the Obama Administration's efforts to prevent and end homelessness as we know it once and for all.""
Continuum of Care grants are awarded competitively to local projects to meet the needs of their homeless clients. The grants fund a wide variety of programs from street outreach and assessment to transitional and permanent housing for homeless persons and families. HUD funds are a critical part of the Obama Administration's strategic plan to prevent and end homelessness.
While the Fiscal Year 2012 funds awarded today are not impacted by the automatic across-the-board budget cuts under sequestration that began March 1st, Donovan cautioned that future budget cuts may reverse significant reported declines in homelessness: ""During this challenging budget climate, we must make certain that we don't balance our books on the backs of our most vulnerable citizens. When we make event modest investments in these programs, we see a measureable decline in homelessness.""
HUD recently announced its 2012 ""point in time"" estimate of the number of homeless persons in America. Approximately 3,000 cities and counties reported 633,782 homeless persons on a single night in January of 2012, largely unchanged from the year before. While HUD found significant declines among the long-term homeless and veterans, local communities reported an increase in the number of sheltered and unsheltered families with children.
HUD's Continuum of Care grants announced today will continue offering permanent and transitional housing to homeless persons as well as services including job training, health care, mental health counseling, substance abuse treatment and child care. Continuum of Care grants are awarded competitively to local programs to meet the needs of their homeless clients.
In 2010, President Obama and 19 federal agencies and offices that form the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH) launched the nation's first comprehensive strategy to prevent and end homelessness. Opening Doors: Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness (www.usich.gov/opening_doors/) puts the country on a path to end veterans and chronic homelessness by 2015 and to ending homelessness among children, family, and youth by 2020."
05/02/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-065.cfm,HUD and Enterprise Showcase Sustainable Construction Design in Indian Country,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and Enterprise Community Partners (Enterprise) showcased Native American communities' use of sustainable design and construction strategies today at the National Museum of the American Indian. The event is part of HUD's and Enterprise's continuous effort to promote sustainable construction techniques in Indian Country.
HUD's Office of Policy Development and Research (PD&R) and the Office of Native American Programs (ONAP) co-hosted a program with Enterprise that featured 22 Native American communities' work that incorporates sustainable and resource-efficient elements in their affordable housing and community development projects. The program is part of the Sustainable Construction in Indian County initiative (www.huduser.org/portal/SCinIC/home.htm), in which PD&R and ONAP partner with Native American communities. This joint venture was developed to promote understanding of the benefits of sustainable construction and help spur wide-spread adoption of sustainable construction technologies in Indian Country.
""Building sustainable housing allows tribes to better control operating and utility costs, and produce homes that are healthier, more comfortable, durable, and energy efficient,"" said Rodger Boyd, Deputy Assistant Secretary for HUD's Office of Native American Programs. ""The event illustrates the long-term value of thoughtful planning and integrated whole building design.""
""From the inception of this initiative HUD has worked hand-in-hand with Native American communities to help construct better homes that use the latest building technologies while respecting traditional building techniques,"" said Todd Richardson, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary for Policy Development for HUD's Office of Policy Development and Research. ""We're pleased to document the use of sustainable construction practices and share them to benefit tribal communities looking for best practices and to learn from their peers.""
""There are challenges throughout the country to develop better sustainable housing including on Indian reservations,"" said Terri Ludwig, President and CEO of Enterprise Community Partners. ""Because of HUD's support, through training and technical assistance, today's program gives a glimpse of promising solutions underway by tribes across the country.""
The showcase featured the deliberate efforts these tribes have undertaken to incorporate elements of sustainability in their construction efforts - sustainability that has both recently, and traditionally, played a key role in all Native American traditions. The gathering gave Native communities an opportunity to showcase their sustainability work; discuss their efforts with colleagues and Washington policymakers; and underscore how Native American communities can work together to learn about and incorporate sustainable strategies in both housing and community design and development.
The chart below lists the tribes that are part of the Sustainable Construction in Indian County initiative.

The following tribal communities were recognized today:
Native Village of Kwinhagak (NVK), Housing Department, Quinhagak AK NVK is constructing two housing designs that can withstand the region's wet and windy weather and developing a self-help housing construction program to defray housing costs. The designs focus on durability, energy efficiency, and light-weight materials. They include a number of design innovations, such as a continuous monolithic thermal envelope, which is a lightweight wall system coated with spray foam on the inside of its exterior wall. Cocopah Indian Tribe, Cocopah Indian Housing and Development (CIHAD), Somerton, AZ To combat desert heat and dryness, the CIHAD has worked with its utility provider to make affordable energy efficiency improvements to three apartment buildings. The CIHAD is in the process of installing low- emissivity windows, 30-year shingles, upgraded air conditioning, and energy efficient appliances. A utility program provided compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs), faucet aerators, and low-flow showerheads as well as utility bill data to assist the CIHAD in determining baseline costs.
Navajo Nation, Navajo Housing Authority (NHA), Window Rock, AZ As part of a move to integrate sustainability into their regular housing development practices, the NHA is exploring the potential for developing an interdisciplinary design review commission, revising the RFQ/RFP selection process to reflect cultural/sustainable goals, and adopting a community-based design/planning process, together with a modified Navajo version of Enterprise Green Communities criteria.
Nez Perce Tribe, Nez Perce Housing Authority (NPHA), Lapwai, ID NPHA is planning 20 duplex housing units, which will be constructed with straw bale infill, timber framing, and structural insulated panels (SIPs) for the roof, all on a frost protected shallow foundation. Cultural design features include east-facing doorways and circular housing clusters with primary eastern orientation, materials that recall traditional reed mat homes, ""shed roof forms"" to recall extended teepees, and carports constructed with wood frames to recall Nez Perce traditional shade structures.
Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians, Department of Natural Resources, Dowagiac, MI The Band's long-term plan views water management and conservation as an integral aspect of a well-thought-out land use and community planning strategy. As such, the project's watershed protection features include bioswales, cluster housing design, permeable pavement, and replacement of invasive plant species with prairie grasses and indigenous vegetation.
Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians (MBCI), Choctaw Housing Authority (CHA), Choctaw, MS Over the past 3 years, the CHA has constructed 74 single-family homes and eight duplexes with SIP walls and roof. Additionally, all of the homes are additionally equipped with low-emissivity windows and doors, CFL lighting, high efficiency HVAC systems, and ENERGY STAR® appliances.
St. Regis Mohawk Tribe, Akwesasne Housing Authority (AHA), Hogansburg, NY The AHA completed construction on five quadplex buildings for elders in a sustainable community setting. The units feature geothermal heating (and cooling in the training center only), six solar photovoltaic arrays, solar domestic hot water (DHW) systems, insulated concrete form wall systems, metal roofing, skylighting tubes, stormwater management and pollution control, ENERGY STAR® appliances, light-emitting diode (LED) and CFL lighting, as well as dual flush toilets, faucet aerators, and low-flow showerheads.
Muscogee Creek Nation, Environmental Services, Okmulgee, OK The Muscogee Creek Nation housing authority is constructing homes with structural insulated panel (SIP) walls and roofs, which are assembled at the tribe's SIPs plant. The houses also include energy efficient windows, LED lighting, ENERGY STAR® appliances, and hot water tanks operating off a geothermal system. Additionally, the tribe is incorporating geothermal heating systems, installed by the tribe using its own geothermal rig."
05/03/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-066.cfm,HUD Announces New Note Sales Under Expanded Distressed Asset Stabilization Program,"WASHINGTON - For the second time this year, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) will sell thousands of severely delinquent mortgage loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) as part of a broader effort to address the housing market's shadow inventory and to target relief to areas experiencing high foreclosure activity. This summer, HUD will sell approximately 20,000 distressed loans through its expanded Distressed Asset Stabilization Program (DASP) to increase recoveries to FHA's Mutual Mortgage Insurance (MMI) Fund from non-performing FHA-insured loans, while contributing to stabilization and recovery in some of the nation's communities hit hardest by the housing crisis.
Like previous note sales, HUD's offerings will be conducted through two auctions - on June 26th, the Department will sell approximately 15,000 notes through 'national pools' and on July 10th will offer approximately 5,000 notes through Neighborhood Stabilization Outcome (NSO) pools. The NSO pools will offer qualified bidders notes located in the following areas: Southern California, Chicago, southern Ohio (including Cincinnati, Columbus and Dayton), and the entire state of North Carolina. HUD is expanding the use of single-family loan sales through a competitive bidding process in which loan pools are sold to the highest bidder, including non-profit and community-based organizations.
""We've seen a tremendous response to our note sales which allow us to support particular areas of our country hard-hit by foreclosures while improving outcomes for FHA,"" said FHA Commissioner Carol Galante. ""These auctions allow us to continue stabilizing hard-hit housing markets and to improve FHA's overall financial position at the same time.""
Under this program, severely delinquent FHA-insured loans are sold competitively at a market-determined price generally below the outstanding principal balance. Once the loan is purchased, foreclosure is delayed for a minimum of six additional months, during which time the new servicer can work with the borrower to find an affordable solution to avoid foreclosure. These loans are purchased at market rate, which is generally below the outstanding principal balance, giving the investor the incentive to take additional steps to help the borrower avoid foreclosure, including modifications that may include reduced principal balances.
HUD expects to sell more than 40,000 distressed loans this year through quarterly sales that reduce FHA's total claims costs and increase recovery on losses to FHA's Mutual Mortgage Insurance (MMI) Fund.
Last March, HUD sold more than 16,000 seriously delinquent mortgages. The first auction, conducted on March 21st, consisted of 12,476 non-performing loans in 10 different ""national"" pools with a combined unpaid principal balance of $2.2 billion. The second auction occurred on March 27th and consisted of nearly 4,000 loans in five different ""Neighborhood Stabilization Outcome (NSO)"" pools with a total of $635 million in unpaid principal balance. The NSO pools consisted of loans pooled in geographically concentrated areas and are accompanied by sale terms that promote neighborhood stability in hard-hit communities. NSO pools in the March sale were in the following geographic areas: Atlanta; Cleveland; Greater Orlando, Florida; Southeastern Florida (including Miami); and Southern California. See results from the March note sales on HUD's website.
Distressed Asset Stabilization Program
FHA's note sales program was resumed in 2010 as a direct sale pilot program that allows pools of mortgages headed for foreclosure to be sold to qualified bidders and charges them with helping to bring the loan out of default. In many cases, this is a less expensive alternative to foreclosure and sale as a real estate-owned (REO) property. An FHA servicer can place a loan into the loan pool if the following criteria are met:
The borrower is at least six months delinquent on their mortgage; The servicer has exhausted all steps in the FHA loss mitigation process; and The servicer has initiated foreclosure proceedings;
• The borrower is at least six months delinquent on their mortgage;
• The servicer has exhausted all steps in the FHA loss mitigation process; and
• The servicer has initiated foreclosure proceedings;
Last year, as part of an effort to address its seriously delinquent loan portfolio, FHA announced that, over the next several years, it would significantly increase the number of loans it makes available for purchase as well as add a new neighborhood stabilization pool to encourage investment in communities hardest hit by the foreclosure crisis. The ""Neighborhood Stabilization Outcome"" (NSO) pools, as an additional safeguard in distressed communities, require that no more than 50 percent of the loans within a purchased pool be marketed as real-estate owned (REO) properties and - if the servicer and borrower are unable to avoid taking the loan through foreclosure - that the servicer achieve some other neighborhood stabilizing outcome, which may include holding the property for rental for at least three years."
05/06/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-063.cfm,"HUD and City of Barberton, Ohio, Settle Discrimination Claim","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has reached a settlement with Barberton, Ohio, a suburb of Akron, resolving allegations that the city denied a permit that would allow the owners of a group home to increase its occupancy limit from four to eight residents. The owners alleged that the city denied the permit because people with disabilities lived in the home.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits municipalities and other local government entities from making zoning or land-use decisions or implementing land-use policies that deny housing or otherwise discriminate in housing against individuals with disabilities.
""Municipal governments must make housing decisions consistent with the Fair Housing Act,"" said John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""We are pleased that the city has resolved this matter in a way that ensures that persons with disabilities have the right to live in neighborhoods, free from discrimination.""
The case came to HUD's attention when the Fair Housing Advocates Association (FHAA), a non-profit organization based in Akron, filed a complaint on behalf of the owners of Rehoboth Group Home. FHAA's complaint alleged that Barberton's Planning Department initially stated that the home was ""consistent with the Barberton Development Code"" and recommended a Conditional Use Permit, but that the city's Planning Commission denied the permit due to neighborhood opposition.
Under the terms of the agreement, the city will grant the owners' request to expand the home from four residents to eight residents and will pay $4,250."
05/06/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-064.cfm,HUD and Jackson County Housing Authority Reach Agreement to Ensure Equal Housing Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities and Families with Children,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has reached a Voluntary Compliance Agreement with the Jackson County Housing Authority (JCHA) in Murphysboro, Illinois, to increase access for persons with disabilities and families with children under age 18. HUD reviewed JCHA's housing programs and services and determined that the housing authority had not ensured that at least five percent of its units were accessible to persons with disabilities, as required by Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The review further indicated that JCHA had not allowed children under the age of 18 to reside in housing designated for elderly families, in violation of the Fair Housing Act.
Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, prohibits discrimination based on disability in any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance. Under Section 504, a public housing authority must make a minimum of five percent of its total dwelling units accessible to persons with mobility impairments. The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing discrimination against families with children under 18 years of age. Public housing or federally assisted housing for the elderly is not exempt from the Fair Housing Act's prohibition against familial status discrimination.
""We are pleased to have reached an agreement with the Jackson County Housing Authority, which will provide accessible housing for persons with disabilities and allow minors to live with their elderly parents or grandparents,"" said John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will continue to work with public housing authorities and other housing providers to ensure that they comply with the requirements of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the Fair Housing Act.""
Under the agreement, JCHA will:
Determine the needs of current residents and those on its application list who are waiting for accessible units, and those who have visual and hearing impairments, and determine how to meet their reasonable accommodation needs; Comply with the familial status provisions of the Fair Housing Actand the program requirements for elderly families; Conduct a Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards study to ensure that JCHA is complying with Section 504; Complete all required modifications within five years of the effective date of the agreement; Develop a resident waiting list and application plan; and Amend its transfer, reasonable accommodation, effective communication, and pet policies.

05/08/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-067.cfm,HUD and Suntrust Bank Settle Maternity Leave Discrimination Claims,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has reached two Conciliation Agreements with SunTrust Mortgage, Inc., settling allegations that the Richmond, VA-based lender denied mortgage loans to a couple in Port St. Lucie, FL, and another couple in Ashland, VA, because the women were on maternity leave.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to discriminate in residential real estate-related transactions based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, disability, or familial status. These prohibitions include denying a mortgage because a person is pregnant or takes maternity or paternity leave.
""A woman's maternity status should not determine whether or not she receives a mortgage loan,"" said John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""The Fair Housing Act prohibits lenders from denying home loans to women because they are pregnant or on maternity leave and HUD is committed to taking action against lenders engaged in discriminatory practices.""
A Port St. Lucie, FL, woman and her husband alleged that SunTrust had pre-approved them for a mortgage loan, but 14 days before closing, a loan officer informed them that the loan would not be approved unless she returned to work.
In the Ashland, VA, case, a couple alleged that the bank had provided a construction-to-permanent mortgage loan but delayed its conversion to a permanent loan until after the woman returned from maternity leave. The Fair Housing Act requires lenders to provide full and fair access to home mortgages regardless of a person's sex or familial status, including pregnancy.
Under the terms of the agreements, SunTrust will pay each couple $18,000, adopt a parental leave policy that prohibits discriminatory mortgage lending due to parental leave, and train their employees on the fair lending requirements of the Fair Housing Act. The Parental Leave Policy specifically prohibits asking mortgage applicants about their intent to take parental leave in the future. The policy also provides that mortgage applicants on or scheduled to be on parental leave may still qualify for loan approval and funding.
Persons who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY).

The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to impose different rental terms and conditions based on national origin, race, color, religion, sex, familial status, or disability.
""Since 1968, the Fair Housing Act has prohibited national origin discrimination, including evicting tenants or denying them service because of their ancestry,"" said John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Central to HUD's mission is to ensure that every person has the right to housing free from discrimination. Today's settlement advances that goal.""
After being told about the complex's discriminatory rental practices, HUD filed a Secretary-initiated complaint alleging that TriTex Real Estate Advisors, Inc., of Atlanta, and its management company terminated lease agreements, ignored maintenance requests, and intimidated and harassed Hispanic tenants.
Under the terms of the agreement, the manager and owner will establish a $150,000 victims' compensation fund for former residents administered by an independent agency and to pay $10,000 each to two non-profit organizations - the Tennessee Fair Housing Council and the Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition (TIRRC) - to identify potential claimants. In addition, TriTex and its management company will adopt fair housing policies and its employees will undergo fair housing training.

05/10/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-070.cfm,Donovan Announces Approval of New York City's Disaster Recovery Plan,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Shaun Donovan today announced HUD's approval of New York City's disaster recovery plan to help homeowners and businesses following Hurricane Sandy. Funded through HUD's Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program, New York City's action plan calls for a combined $1.77 billion investment in a variety of housing, infrastructure and business recovery activities. Read New York City's disaster recovery plan (www.nyc.gov/html/cdbg/html/plan/read.shtml).
The federal government has been on the ground since Sandy struck and will continue to provide substantial resources and technical assistance until the entire region is rebuilt safer, better and stronger. To date, FEMA has provided over $1.2 billion in individual and public assistance in New York City and the Small Business Administration has provided over $1.4 billion in disaster recovery loans to businesses throughout New York State.
Donovan, who also chairs President Obama's Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force, said today's approval will allow the City to begin the long-term process of rebuilding damaged housing, restoring infrastructure, and stimulating business activity and job growth.
""This plan is truly a neighborhood-based approach to disaster recovery,"" said Donovan. ""We've worked closely with Mayor Bloomberg, Senators Schumer and Gillibrand, and the New York Congressional Delegation throughout this process to help families get back in their homes, jumpstart local economies and make communities more resilient.""
""The City took immediate action in the days following the storm - distributing millions of meals, housing thousands of displaced New Yorkers and repairing more than 20,000 homes - and these Federal dollars will help us continue our recovery work to get home and business owners back on their feet,"" said Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. ""With the Federal approval now in place, we're going to see that this relief money starts flowing to home and business owners as soon as possible. I want to thank Secretary Donovan's for his leadership and our Congressional Delegation - especially Senators Schumer and Gillibrand - for their advocacy to secure this funding.""
""Now that this plan is approved, desperately needed dollars can start flowing to the homeowners and business owners who lost so much,"" said Senator Charles E. Schumer. ""It is a turning point in our recovery from the storm, but our work won't be done until houses are totally rebuilt, businesses are reopen, and roads, bridges, schools and other infrastructure has been repaired, stronger than it was before.""
""This is an important day in the recovery process for families and small businesses who were devastated by Hurricane Sandy,"" Senator Kirsten Gillibrand said. ""These critical federal funds will help families get back on their feet and help hard hit communities rebuild stronger and smarter. We will keep working together to secure every federal resource we need for a full recovery.""
On January 29th, President Obama signed the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013 into law, providing a total of $16 billion in CDBG Disaster Recovery funding. HUD quickly allocated $5.4 billion to five states (including New York) and New York City. New York City submitted its required action plan describing how the funds will be used on April 23rd and HUD conducted an expedited review to enable New York City to access these funds as quickly as possible.
The CDBG Disaster Recovery funding gives grantees significant flexibility in determining how best to use their funds to meet the greatest unmet needs. In general, the funds are intended for the restoration of housing and infrastructure as well as economic revitalization in disaster-impacted areas. The funds are to meet recovery needs that are not otherwise covered by other federal assistance, private insurance, or other sources.
New York City's approach will focus principally on meeting the immediate recovery needs for housing and business assistance in the communities affected by Hurricane Sandy. These activities include $648 million to support a variety of housing programs; $293 million to assist economic revitalization programs; and $654 million for infrastructure, resiliency, and public service programs."

The latest data show important progress across many key indicators—as home values continue to rise and home sales remained strong in April—although officials caution that the overall recovery remains fragile.The full Housing Scorecard is available online at www.hud.gov/scorecard.
""The Obama Administration's efforts to speed the housing recovery are showing continued progress as the April scorecard indicators highlight ongoing improvements throughout the housing market,"" said HUD Deputy Assistant Secretary for Economic Affairs Kurt Usowski. ""The annual increase in home prices is the highest in nearly seven years and sales of existing and new homes are both up over 10 percent from one year ago. But with so many households still struggling to make ends meet, we have important work ahead.""
""The Administration's programs have improved outcomes for homeowners by setting new standards for mortgage assistance and putting into place unprecedented consumer protections,"" said Treasury Assistant Secretary for Financial Stability Tim Massad. ""HAMP continues to offer struggling families meaningful relief to avoid foreclosure and strengthen local communities.""
The April Housing Scorecard features key data on the health of the housing market and the impact of the Administration's foreclosure prevention programs, including:
The Administration's foreclosure mitigation programs are providing relief for millions of homeowners as we continue to recover from an unprecedented housing crisis. Nearly 1.6 million homeowner assistance actions have taken place through the Making Home Affordable Program, including more than 1.1 million permanent modifications through the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP), while the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) has offered more than 1.7 million loss mitigation and early delinquency interventions. The Administration's programs continue to encourage improved standards and processes in the industry, with HOPE Now lenders offering families and individuals more than 3.5 million proprietary mortgage modifications through February. Homeowners in HAMP continue to benefit from deep payment relief, helping them sustain their mortgage payments over time. As of March, more than 1.1 million homeowners have received a permanent modification through the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP), saving approximately $546 on their mortgage payments each month, and an estimated $19.1 billion to date. Eighty-seven percent of homeowners starting the program in the past two and a half years have received a permanent modification of their mortgage through HAMP. Payment relief is strongly correlated to sustainability of modified payments over time. As a result, HAMP modifications continue to exhibit lower delinquency and re-default rates than industry modifications as reported by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.

Also featured this month in the Administration's Housing Scorecard is a regional spotlight on market strength in the New York metropolitan area. The foreclosure crisis in the Metropolitan area developed later and differently than in other areas of the nation. While home price appreciation during the housing bubble progressed more rapidly than it did nationally, home prices in the region did not fall as sharply.
""The New York housing market is seeing the same signs of greater stability that the national data show for the broader housing market,"" said Usowski. ""As this Regional Spotlight reports, the Administration's efforts have helped nearly 231,600 New York metropolitan area households avoid foreclosure. A strong local economic recovery is underway despite the impact of Hurricane Sandy, but we have much more to do to reach the many households who still face trouble and to help the New York market recover more broadly.""
The Housing Scorecard Regional Spotlight features data on the health of the New York metropolitan housing market and impact of efforts to help homeowners at the local level, as well as a summary of the added impacts on the local housing market from the devastation brought by Hurricane Sandy including:
Economic and housing market conditions in the New York metropolitan area are improving. The unemployment rate for the region peaked at 9.3 percent in February 2010 and has since fallen to 8.4 percent as of March 2013. Although the share of distressed mortgages remains high, the foreclosure completion rate has remained well below the national rate. The Administration's Hardest Hit Fund and Neighborhood Stabilization Programs have fueled local foreclosure prevention efforts and market stability, while nearly 231,600 households have received mortgage modifications, many directly through Administration programs. Treasury provided $300 million to the State of New Jersey to provide assistance to struggling homeowners through the Hardest Hit Fund. The number of homeowners benefitting from the program has continued to increase due to growing demand. Moreover, approximately $110 million has been awarded to the New York metropolitan region through HUD's Neighborhood Stabilization Program to help purchase or redevelop residential properties and address the effects of abandoned and foreclosed housing. Both programs have helped provide increased stability to the New York housing market. While the impacts of Hurricane Sandy on individual homeowners and affected communities were devastating, the overall economic impacts on the job market and employment in the region show an immediate spike in initial jobless claims and a drop in total employment after the storm, both of which rebounded quickly. Total employment in the New York metropolitan area, which fell by 32,000 jobs in November, increased by 53,200 in December to exceed total employment just before the storm.

05/10/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-073.cfm,"St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana, Agrees to $2.5 Million Settlement to Resolve Housing Discrimination Lawsuits","WASHINGTON - The Justice Department and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that St. Bernard Parish, La., has agreed to a settlement valued at more than $2.5 million to resolve separate lawsuits by the United States and private plaintiffs alleging that the parish sought to restrict rental housing to African Americans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.
The United States' lawsuit alleged, among other things, that the parish: (1) passed a law, known as the permissive use permit ordinance, that prevented homeowners from renting single-family homes in residential zones without first obtaining a permit from the parish; (2) revised its zoning code to reduce dramatically the amount of land available for multi-family apartments; and (3) interfered with individuals' housing rights. The lawsuit further alleged that these actions were done to limit or deny rental housing to African-Americans in violation of the Fair Housing Act. These actions came on the heels of the parish's other efforts after Hurricane Katrina to restrict rental housing opportunities, including halting the re-establishment or redevelopment of rental housing and enacting a permit requirement for single-family rentals but exempting renters who were ""related by blood"" to the homeowners. The parish later rescinded these restrictions.
""The Fair Housing Act is clear that local governments cannot use their zoning and land-use laws to discriminate on the basis of race,"" said Eric Halperin, Senior Counsel and Special Counsel for Fair Lending in the Civil Rights Division. ""People should have the freedom to choose where they live, without regard to race, and this innovative settlement will create greater housing opportunities in the New Orleans area.""
""The right of all of our citizens to enjoy fair and equal access to housing opportunities is guaranteed by our laws,"" said Dana Boente, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Louisiana. ""The U.S. Department of Justice is committed to fiercely protecting those rights in order to ensure the quality of life all Americans deserve.""
""No community has the right to keep people from living in that community because of their race,"" said John Trasviña, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD and the Justice Department are committed to taking action against municipalities that violate the Fair Housing Act by instituting discriminatory zoning and other housing practices.""
Under the settlement, which still must be approved by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, the parish must pay $275,000 to eight aggrieved persons identified by the United States and $15,000 to the United States as a civil penalty, establish a new Office of Fair Housing and hire a fair housing coordinator with a gross annual salary of at least $40,000, spend $25,000 each year in a marketing and advertising campaign to attract renters and developers of multi-family rental housing to the parish, and establish a rental land grant program through which the parish will transfer lands in its possession, free of cost, to qualified persons or entities who are willing to create or rehabilitate housing for rental purposes. The land grant program, which requires the parish to offer lands worth up to $83,000 each year, will last for five years; other programmatic features will last for three. Parish officials must also undergo fair-housing training and provide periodic reports to the United States. In a separate agreement, the parish agreed to pay $1.65 million in compensation, costs and attorneys' fees to two sets of private plaintiffs.
On Jan. 28, 2011, HUD initiated a fair housing complaint against St. Bernard Parish alleging it adopted and implemented zoning ordinances that denied or restricted housing to persons based on their race. HUD demanded the parish rescind two key discriminatory ordinances and on April 8, 2011, the parish complied. Following its investigation, HUD referred eight complaints from parish homeowners to the Justice Department alleging that the parish's zoning processes were discriminatory. In January 2012 HUD referred the secretary-initiated complaint to the Justice Department as well. The Justice Department conducted its own investigation and filed suit in January 2012.
The federal Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in housing based on race, color, religion, national origin, sex, disability and familial status. More information about the Civil Rights Division and the laws it enforces is available at www.usdoj.gov/crt.

05/13/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-069.cfm,HUD Charges Pennsylvania Homeless Shelter with Discriminating Against Individual with Disabilities,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is charging City Rescue Mission of New Castle (CRM) and one of its employees with refusing to accept a blind man and his guide dog at a homeless shelter in New Castle, PA. HUD's investigation found that CRM denied a reasonable accommodation request to allow the man to keep his dog in the shelter, in violation of the Fair Housing Act.
The Fair Housing Act requires housing providers to make reasonable accommodations in their rules, policies, practices, or services when needed to provide persons with disabilities an equal opportunity to use or enjoy a dwelling.
""For many people with disabilities, guide dogs and other assistance animals are necessities, not options,"" stated John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will enforce Fair Housing Act protections to ensure that housing providers grant reasonable accommodation requests.""
According to HUD's charge, a blind, homeless individual contacted CRM in order to seek shelter. HUD's charge alleges that a CRM employee informed the man that he could not move into the shelter with his guide dog even after the man said that he could not be without his service animal. When a caseworker from Lawrence County Community Action, an organization that assists low-income people, contacted the shelter and explained that the man needed the guide dog because of his disability, the CRM employee again refused, saying that the dog would have to go elsewhere.
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages to aggrieved persons for the damages caused them by the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief to deter further discrimination, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose fines in order to vindicate the public interest. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages to aggrieved persons.
Persons who believe they have been denied a reasonable accommodation request may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to www.hud.gov/fairhousing, or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, which can be accessed through Apple devices, such as the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch."
05/13/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-071.cfm,Affordable Housing Developments Win HUD Secretary Design Award,"WASHINGTON - Three affordable housing developments are the recipients of the 2013 HUD Secretary's Housing and Community Design Award, each recognized for excellence in residential housing design. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the American Institute of Architects (AIA) selected Via Verde-The Green Way in New York City; Community Learning in Leominster, Massachusetts; and New Accessible Passive Solar Housing, Stoneham, Massachusetts as national affordable housing models.
""These developments prove that you can push the boundaries of design while still creating something very special that folks can actually afford,"" said Donovan, himself a trained architect. ""These projects took innovative visions from the drawing board and made them a part of how we live today.""
The awards will be presented on June 21, 2013, in a special ceremony during the 2013 AIA National Convention and Design Exposition in Denver. The 2013 HUD Secretary's Housing and Community Design Award recipients are:
For Excellence in Affordable Housing Design - This award recognizes architecture that demonstrates overall excellence in terms of design in response to both the needs and constraints of affordable housing.
Via Verde - The Green Way: New York City (www.huduser.org/portal/about/housingCommDesign_2013_1.html). Via Verde is a sustainable, urban, permanently affordable residential development in the South Bronx. It is an important component in the revitalization of a low-income neighborhood, reflecting a commitment to create the next generation of social housing that addresses poverty, health, and the environment. Situated on a former brownfield site, Via Verde consists of a 20-story tower, a 6- to 13-story mid-rise duplex apartment component, and 2- to 4-story townhouses. Its 222 apartments include 71 workforce housing cooperatives for residents earning 80 to 100 percent of the Area Median Income (AMI) and 151 low-income units for residents earning 60 percent or less of AMI.
The ground floor features retail stores, a community health center, live-work units, and a courtyard that leads to a series of terraced, south-facing roof gardens that create outdoor environments and a promenade for residents. The gardens offer contact with nature, and opportunities for gardening, recreation and social gathering, while providing storm water control and enhanced insulation from, and mitigation of, the urban heat island effect. Rainwater runoff is collected and recycled for irrigation. Photovoltaic panels provide 66 kilowatts of energy to power lighting in common areas. The panels, mounted on south-facing facades of the stepped roofs and on roof trellises, are an integral part of the architectural design. Via Verde is on track to achieve LEED-NC Gold certification.
The building envelope, a prefabricated rain screen panel system, provides a well-insulated, ""breathing"" enclosure with a contemporary aesthetic. Sunshades diffuse direct solar radiation. Large windows, typically on two exposures to promote cross-ventilation in apartments, provide abundant daylight, while ceiling fans and operable windows reduce air conditioning needs. Natural lighting and colorful finishes in stairwells promote use of the stairs, encouraging physical activity as part of New York City's Active Design program. Via Verde's high-efficiency mechanical systems, EnergyStar lighting and appliances, lighting controls, and low-flow plumbing fixtures reduce energy use by 25 percent.
For Community-Informed Design - This award recognizes design that supports physical communities as they rebuild social structures and relationships that may have been weakened by outmigration, disinvestment, and the isolation of inner-city areas.
Community Learning Center: Leominster, Massachusetts (www.huduser.org/portal/about/housingCommDesign_2013_2.html). Sited near the center of the small, once-prosperous city of Leominster, the Community Learning Center operated for years out of a tiny apartment in a public housing development, getting at-risk kids on track to graduation and college. The Leominster Housing Authority received a grant to cover half the cost of a new 2,000-square-foot facility and made arrangements with the local vocational/technical high school to provide the labor to make up the difference. Plans were prepared by the high school drafting class. Realizing that licensed professionals were needed to ensure the success of the project, the architectural firm Abacus Architects + Planners was brought in to rethink the design and coordinate the efforts of the Housing Authority, the residents, the Learning Center staff, and the high school's Center for Technical Education.
The firm worked for three years with students, teachers, and development residents to modify the design, set up for construction, and build the project. The resulting design is a simple barn-like structure with operable south-facing windows for passive solar heating. The interior is an open space that one teacher can monitor, with ""green"" particle board partitions to provide individual study areas. From pouring the slab to hoisting the beams, the firm worked closely with the teenage crew to bring design sketches into reality.
When it became clear that the grant and student labor wouldn't cover costs and an appeal was made to the community, two dozen suppliers and builders stepped forward and contributed materials and labor. Many of those contributors were once in the Vo-Tech program and credit it with teaching them the skills that were the key to their success. Also not coincidentally, many of the students who built the Center had participated in the Center's programs when they were younger or were public housing residents. The completed building is thus a testament to the power of community.
For Housing Accessibility - Alan J. Rothman Award - The purpose of this award is to recognize exemplary projects that demonstrate excellence in improving housing accessibility for people with disabilities.
New Accessible Passive Solar Housing, Stoneham, Massachusetts (www.huduser.org/portal/about/housingCommDesign_2013_3.html). New Accessible Passive Solar Housing units have been added to an existing public housing development in Stoneham, to boost the town's inventory of accessible housing. While all elements of the four-unit building and the site it occupies meet the Americans with Disabilities Act and Massachusetts accessibility requirements, other considerations - quality of life, connections to the outside world, and being responsive to the climate - also drove design considerations. The sloping topography was gradedto avoid ramps and double railings that cut off many accessible buildings from the surrounding landscape. Entrances are sheltered by simple pitched roofs that provide shade during the summer. The open living spaces are lit from above by clerestories and interior windows that bring the sun into every room, hallway, and bathroom so that artificial lighting is never needed during the day. Blue sky and green trees are visible in all directions. South-facing windows bring in the low winter sun, while deciduous trees and broad overhangs provide summer shade. High- and low-operable windows that reduce the need for air conditioning and radiant heat in the concrete floors allow the buildings to provide energy-efficient comfort."
05/16/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-074.cfm,HUD and Census Bureau Announce New Residential Construction Activity in April,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Census Bureau today announced the following new residential construction statistics for April 2013:
BUILDING PERMITS
Privately owned housing units authorized by building permits in April were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,017,000. This is 14.3 percent (±1.0%) above the revised March rate of 890,000 and is 35.8 percent (±1.3%) above the April 2012 estimate of 749,000.

Authorizations of units in buildings with five units or more were at a rate of 374,000 in April.
HOUSING STARTS
Privately owned housing starts in April were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 853,000. This is 16.5 percent (±5.2%) below the revised March estimate of 1,021,000, but is 13.1 percent (±5.1%) above the April 2012 rate of 754,000. Single-family housing starts in April were at a rate of 610,000; this is 2.1 percent (±4.8%)* below the revised March figure of 623,000. The April rate for units in buildings with five units or more was 234,000.

The April rate for units in buildings with five units or more was 149,000.
EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take 2 months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, 4 months for total starts, and 6 months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as non-sampling error including bias and variance from response, non-reporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent ( 3.2%) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90-percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised about three percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found on our web site.
* 90% confidence interval includes zero. The Census Bureau does not have sufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero.

05/16/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-075.cfm,HUD's Office of Field Policy and Management Wins W. Edwards Deming Award,"WASHINGTON - This week, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Office of Field Policy and Management (FPM) was presented with the Graduate School USA's annual W. Edwards Deming Award for a staff training and orientation program to reinforce the use of next generation cloud computing. The W. Edwards Deming Award recognizes impressive workforce development and training initiatives that measurably improve an organization's performance and impacts its mission.
FPM was selected for implementing its training and orientation program to reinforce the use of cloud computing for tracking and reporting project performance in order to improve its ongoing reporting to Congress and other key constituents.
""This cloud based system has transformed HUD into a 21st century agency - through the use of this cloud system we can now see how our strategic goals are being achieved throughout this great nation and in the unique localities we serve,"" said Pat Hoban-Moore, Director, Office of Field Policy and Management. ""Our staff in Field Policy and Management can now align their daily work to the agency's strategic plan and understand how they directly impact HUD's mission.""
The program improved the ability of field-level staff members to track their projects, demonstrate alignment to HUD strategic goals and report on their progress. The complexity of the organizational mission and the geographic distribution of the target populations presented unique challenges, with hundreds of employees in 80 field offices throughout the United States and oversight by 10 regional headquarters. The reporting application is used on a daily basis by FPM staff in the field and at HUD headquarters in Washington, DC.
The cloud based application is used by 100 percent of FPM staff, with 25-30 percent logging in daily to perform project-related work. Numerous field recommendations have resulted in improved reporting to Congress and other critical information recipients.
The award's namesake is Dr. W. Edwards Deming, who taught at Graduate School USA for 20 years and is considered the father of Total Quality Management. His work incorporated the idea that employees and managers at all levels of private industry and government have a responsibility to cooperate to improve products and services."

HUD will resume normal operation on Tuesday, May 28th, following the Memorial Day federal holiday. We encourage those with business in HUD offices to plan accordingly."
05/21/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-077.cfm,HUD and Alabama Real Estate Company Settle Claim Alleging Agent Discriminated Against African American Homebuyer,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that LLB&B, Inc., a real estate company based in Mobile, AL, will pay $29,000 as part of a Conciliation Agreement resolving allegations that one of its agents refused to show a condominium to a prospective homebuyer because he is African American. The homebuyer alleged that he learned of the discrimination when the real estate agent inadvertently left a message on his telephone voicemail indicating her belief that white neighbors would 'panic' at the prospect of an African American neighbor.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to discriminate in the sale or rental of housing based on, race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, or disability. It also prohibits refusing to show a condominium to a prospective buyer and making statements that discriminate because of race or color.
""No one should be denied the opportunity to purchase a home because of their race,"" said John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""The company has taken steps to resolve this matter, provide relief to the potential homebuyer and prevent a recurrence.""
Under the terms of the agreement, LLB agreed to pay the man $29,000, require fair housing training for all its employees, and include the fair housing logo in all its advertising.
The case came to HUD's attention when a man filed a complaint with HUD, alleging that a real estate agent with whom he inquired about the sale of a condominium inadvertently left a voicemail with him indicating she did not wish to deal with him because he is African-American. In the message, the real estate agent, referring to the white neighbors who lived near the condominium, allegedly stated, ""Those people will panic when they see a black person drive up and look at it."" She added: ""I called him back. He didn't answer so that was good! If I didn't call him back he could sue me for prejudice."" The man shared the recording with a HUD investigator, who then shared it with the real estate company. Upon hearing the message, the owners of LLB&B terminated the agent's employment.
Persons who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to www.hud.gov/fairhousing, or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, which can be accessed through Apple devices, such as the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch."
05/21/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-078.cfm,HUD Announces Foreclosure Protection for Oklahoma Storm Victims,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan today announced that HUD will speed federal disaster assistance to the State of Oklahoma in addition to resources being provided by Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and other federal partners. HUD will provide support to homeowners and low-income renters forced from their homes due to tornadoes and severe storms.
Donovan also reinforced an existing Federal Housing Administration (FHA) policy that mortgage lenders should release insurance payments to homeowners rather than applying these funds toward outstanding mortgage debt. Read FHA's policy.
Today, President Obama issued a disaster declaration for Cleveland, Lincoln, McClain, Oklahoma and Pottawatomie counties. The President's declaration allows HUD to offer foreclosure relief and other assistance to certain families living in these counties.
""We will stand with Oklahomans for as long as it takes,"" said Donovan. ""As families begin the difficult process to recover from this devastating storm, HUD stands ready to help in any way we can.""
One of the most immediate needs following a disaster is housing for displaced persons and families. Individuals who were receiving HUD rental assistance before the disaster should contact their Public Housing Authority, multi-family apartment manager or local HUD office for help in locating temporary housing. Individuals in need of housing who were not HUD-assisted before the disaster should contact FEMA for help with temporary housing. HUD will share information with FEMA and the State on housing providers that may have available units in the impacted counties, including Public Housing Agencies and multi-family owners.
HUD will assist homeowners by:
Granting immediate foreclosure relief for homeowners with FHA-insured mortgages - HUD granted a 90-day moratorium on foreclosures and forbearance on foreclosures of Federal Housing Administration (FHA)-insured home mortgages; Making mortgage insurance availableto allow those who lost their homes to get 100% mortgage financing - HUD's Section 203(h) program provides FHA insurance to disaster victims who have lost their homes and are facing the daunting task of rebuilding or buying another home. Borrowers from participating FHA-approved lenders are eligible for 100 percent financing, including closing costs; Making insurance available for both mortgages and home rehabilitation - HUD's Section 203(k) loan program enables those who have lost their homes to finance the purchase or refinance of a house along with its repair through a single mortgage. It also allows homeowners who have damaged houses to finance the rehabilitation of their existing single-family home; and

05/21/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-079.cfm,National Mortgage Settlement Provides More Than $50 Billion in Consumer Relief,"WASHINGTON - The nation's largest mortgage servicers have distributed $50.63 billion in direct relief to over 620,000 homeowners, or roughly $81,000 per homeowner as part of the National Mortgage Settlement, according to a progress update released today by independent settlement monitor Joseph A. Smith of the Office of Mortgage Settlement Oversight. Over one year ago, the Department of Justice, Department of Housing Urban Development (HUD) and 49 state attorneys general reached a landmark agreement with the nation's five largest mortgage servicers to address mortgage loan servicing and foreclosure abuses. The Monitor's state-level data can be downloaded here (https://www.mortgageoversight.com/reports/monitors-updated-national-consumer-relief). A fact sheet summarizing national consumer relief can be downloaded here (https://www.mortgageoversight.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Fact-Sheet_May-progress-reportFINAL.pdf).
The report demonstrates significant progress on the broadest and most robust principal reduction program in the nation's history. Nearly $30 billion of the overall completed consumer relief has come in the form of principal forgiveness and refinancing. Because of the settlement, the principal reduction helps borrowers stay in their homes, lowering monthly payments on over 310,000 loans and actually reducing struggling homeowners' loan balances by more than $83,000 on average.
The following is a statement released today by HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan:
""One year in, it is clear that this historic settlement is making a profound difference on lives and communities. We have far surpassed expectations in our efforts to assist struggling Americans. Due to the efforts by 49 bipartisan state attorneys general and the federal government, hundreds of thousands of people are able to stay in their homes or avoid foreclosure, preventing the erosion of the social fabric of our communities. As a result of the settlement, over 620,000 homeowners have received on average more than $81,000 in benefits thus far.
The Monitor's latest update reaffirms a simple truth: that large-scale principal reduction is an important tool in preventing foreclosures. We look forward to reviewing the Monitor's compliance reports next month. We will also continue to keep a close eye on the banks to ensure they live up to their end of the deal when completing their consumer relief requirements and their progress on implementing new and improved servicing standards. We will not stop until homeowners get a fair shake."""
05/23/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-080.cfm,HUD Awards $98 Million to Protect Children from Lead and Other Home Hazards,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today awarded $98.3 million in grants to 38 local projects to protect children and families from the hazards of lead-based paint and from other home health and safety hazards (see chart below).
The grant funding announced today will clean up lead paint hazards and other health hazards in 6,373 high-risk homes, train workers in lead-safe work practices, and increase public awareness about childhood lead poisoning. Lead is a known toxin that can impair children's development and have effects lasting into adulthood.
""Childhood lead poisoning is completely preventable and that's exactly what these funds are designed to do,"" said HUD Deputy Secretary Maurice Jones. ""The communities receiving these grants are helping their children grow up brighter, safer and healthier.""
""These grant awards demonstrate that a priority for HUD is providing healthy and safe homes for families and children,"" noted Jon L. Gant, Director of HUD's Office of Healthy Homes and Lead Hazard Control. ""HUD is committed to protecting children from the hazards that can be caused by deteriorated lead paint, and by the mold that follows moisture intruding into the home, as part of the Department's efforts to make the nation's housing healthy and sustainable.""
These grant programs of HUD's Office of Healthy Homes and Lead Hazard Control promote local efforts to eliminate dangerous lead hazards from lower income homes; stimulate private sector investment in lead hazard control; and educate the public about the dangers of lead-based paint. A complete project-by-project summary of the programs awarded grants today can be found on HUD's website.
Lead Hazard Control Grant Programs
Even though lead-based paint was banned for residential use in 1978, HUD estimates that approximately 24 million homes still have significant lead-based paint hazards today. Lead-contaminated dust is the primary cause of lead exposure and can lead to a variety of health problems in young children, including reduced IQ, learning disabilities, developmental delays, reduced height, and impaired hearing. At higher levels, lead can damage a child's kidneys and central nervous system and cause anemia, coma, convulsions and even death.
The funding announced today directs critical funds to cities, counties and states to eliminate dangerous lead paint hazards in thousands of privately-owned, low-income housing units. These funds are provided through HUD's Lead-Based Paint Hazard Control and Lead Hazard Reduction Demonstration grant programs. To expand the reach of HUD's Lead Hazard Control Program. HUD is also providing over $4.4 million to help communities transform their lead hazard control programs to address multiple housing-related hazards.
The following is a state-by-state breakdown of the funding announced today:

This is 2.3 percent (±12.8%)* above the revised March rate of 444,000 and is 29.0 percent (±20.7%) above the April 2012 estimate of 352,000. The median sales price of new houses sold in April 2013 was $271,600; the average sales price was $330,800. The seasonally adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of April was 156,000. This represents a supply of 4.1 months at the current sales rate.
New Residential Sales data for May 2013 will be released on Tuesday, June 25, 2013, at 10:00 A.M. EDT.

It takes 3 months to establish a trend for new houses sold. Preliminary new home sales figures are subject to revision due to the survey methodology and definitions used. The survey is primarily based on a sample of houses selected from building permits. Since a ""sale"" is defined as a deposit taken or sales agreement signed, this can occur prior to a permit being issued. An estimate of these prior sales is included in the sales figure. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimate of total sales is revised about 4 percent. Changes in sales price data reflect changes in the distribution of houses by region, size, etc., as well as changes in the prices of houses with identical characteristics.

05/29/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-082.cfm,"HUD & VA Team Up to Provide Permanent Homes to 9,000 Homeless Vets","WASHINGTON - Approximately 9,000 homeless veterans living on the streets and in the nation's shelter system will soon find a permanent place to call home. U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Shaun Donovan and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Secretary Eric K. Shinseki announced today that HUD will provide $60 million to local public housing agencies across the country to provide permanent supportive housing to homeless veterans, many of whom are living with chronic disabling conditions.
The supportive housing assistance announced today is provided through the HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) Program which combines rental assistance from HUD with case management and clinical services provided by VA. Since 2008, a total of 48,385 vouchers have been awarded and 42,557 formerly homeless veterans are currently in homes because of HUD-VASH.
Donovan and Shinseki announced this additional support for homeless veterans in an address to the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans Annual Conference today in Washington. Find out how much of this assistance will help homeless veterans in your area.
""Our veterans have answered the call of duty. That's why our nation has its own duty - to help homeless servicemen and women rejoin the very communities they have given so much to protect,"" said Donovan. ""These grants make it possible to help more veterans obtain housing, bringing us steps closer to our goal of ending veteran homelessness by 2015.""
""These HUD-VASH vouchers are a critical resource to accomplish our shared goal of ending Veterans' homelessness in 2015,"" Shinseki said. ""With the continued support of President Obama, Congress, and our community partners, we will end homelessness among Veterans and provide these brave men and women with the earned care and benefits that help them live productive, meaningful lives.""
HUD-VASH is a critical part of the Obama Administration's commitment to end Veteran and long-term chronic homelessness by 2015. Opening Doors: Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness (www.usich.gov/PDF/FactSheetVeterans.pdf) serves as a roadmap for how the federal government will work with state and local communities to confront the root causes of homelessness, especially among former servicemen and women. HUD's annual ""point in time"" estimate of the number of homeless persons and families for 2012 found that veteran homelessness fell by 7.2 percent (or 4,876 people) since January 2011 and by 17.2 percent since January 2009. On a single night in January 2012, 62,619 veterans were homeless.
The grants announced today are part of $75 million appropriated this year to support the housing needs of homeless veterans. Local public housing authorities provide rental assistance to homeless veterans while nearby VA Medical Centers (VAMC) offer supportive services and case management. This is the first round of the 2013 HUD-VASH funding. HUD expects to announce more HUD-VASH funding this summer.
VAMCs work closely with homeless veterans then refer them to public housing agencies for these vouchers, based upon a variety of factors, most importantly the duration of the homelessness and the need for longer term more intensive support to obtain and maintain permanent housing. The HUD-VASH program includes both the rental assistance the voucher provides and the comprehensive case management that VAMC staff provides.
Veterans participating in the HUD-VASH program rent privately owned housing and generally contribute no more than 30 percent of their income toward rent. VA offers eligible homeless veterans clinical and supportive services through its medical centers across the U.S., Guam and Puerto Rico."
05/30/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-083.cfm,Obama Administration Extends Application Deadline for the Making Home Affordable Program,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of the Treasury and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today announced an extension of the Obama Administration's Making Home Affordable Program through December 31, 2015. The new deadline was determined in coordination with the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) to align with extended deadlines for the Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP) and the Streamlined Modification Initiative for homeowners with loans owned or guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The Making Home Affordable Program has been a critical part of the Obama Administration's comprehensive efforts to provide relief to families at risk of foreclosure and help the housing market recover from a historic housing crisis. The program deadline was previously December 31, 2013.
""The housing market is gaining steam, but many homeowners are still struggling,"" said Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew. ""Helping responsible homeowners avoid foreclosure is part of our wide-ranging efforts to strengthen the middle class, and Making Home Affordable offers homeowners some of the deepest and most dependable assistance available to prevent foreclosure. Extending the program for two years will benefit many additional families while maintaining clear standards and accountability for an important part of the mortgage industry.""
""The Making Home Affordable Program has provided help and hope to America's homeowners,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""Families across the country have used its tools to reduce their principal, modify their mortgages, fight off foreclosure and stay in their homes - helping further stimulate our housing market recovery. And with this extension, we ensure that the program keeps supporting communities for years to come.""
Since its launch in March 2009, about 1.6 million actions have been taken through the program to provide relief to homeowners and nearly 1.3 million homeowners have been helped directly by the program. The Making Home Affordable Program includes the Home Affordable Modification Program or HAMP, which modifies the terms of a homeowner's mortgage to reduce their monthly payment to prevent foreclosure. As of March 2013, more than 1.1 million homeowners have received a permanent modification of their mortgage through HAMP, with a median savings of $546 every month - or 38 percent of their previous payment. Data from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) shows that the median savings for homeowners in HAMP is higher than the median savings for homeowners in private industry modifications, which has helped homeowners in HAMP sustain their mortgage payments at higher rates. As a result, HAMP modifications continue to exhibit lower delinquency and re-default rates than industry modifications.
The Making Home Affordable Program has also put into place important protections for homeowners that have helped inform efforts to create standards for the mortgage servicing industry. This includes requirements for mortgage servicers regarding clear and timely communications with homeowners and protections to ensure that homeowners are evaluated for assistance before being referred to foreclosure. The Administration has issued reports on the program every month since July 2009, which provide the most detailed information available about individual servicer efforts to assist homeowners. As part of this report, Treasury issues a quarterly assessment for each of the largest servicers in the program to highlight their compliance with program requirements.
Homeowners seeking assistance with their mortgage payments should remember that there is never a fee to apply to the Making Home Affordable Program. Homeowners can work with a HUD-approved housing counseling agency free-of-charge to understand their options and apply for help. Homeowners should visit MakingHomeAffordable.gov for more information about free resources for assistance or call 1-888-995-HOPE (4673)."
05/30/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-084.cfm,HUD Awards $32 Million to 30 Local HIV-AIDS Housing Programs,"WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced $32 million in grant awards to assist more than 1,300 extremely low-income persons and families living with HIV/AIDS annually. The grant awards will provide these households with a stable living environment, which is essential to accessing healthcare and HIV related services. In addition to housing assistance these grant programs will provide access to the needed supportive services in assisting beneficiaries with a path to self-sufficiency such as life skills, job readiness services and employment training.
The funding announced today is offered through HUD's Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS Program (HOPWA) and will renew HUD's support of 30 local programs in 20 states (see attached chart and individual project descriptions below).
""These grants will provide our local partners with crucial funding that is necessary to provide individuals and families living with HIV/AIDS a place to call home,"" said Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""The comfort of knowing that you have a roof over your head makes a huge difference in the wellbeing of families and gives hope to those who might otherwise end up living on the streets.""
Many of the projects receiving renewed funding provide for specialized models in outreach and service delivery, including efforts that target help to persons who have been homeless or are at extreme risk of becoming homeless. The awarded programs are designed to increase coordination with the homeless assistance grant programs as well as other federal resources provided at the local level. These grants offer innovations in HIV care to increase job readiness and employment opportunities for persons in stabilized care. The grants announced today also support the Obama Administration's Opening Doors (www.usich.gov/PDF/OpeningDoors_2010_FSPPreventEndHomeless.pdf), strategic plan to prevent and end homelessness, and National HIV AIDS Strategy, that identifies Housing as a key component to preventing the spread of HIV.
In addressing goals under these strategies, HUD will contribute a variety of housing resources to promote better integration of housing interventions into comprehensive HIV care systems. Housing assistance and related services funded by HOPWA are an essential part of the comprehensive system of care for low-income persons living with HIV/AIDS. A stable home environment is also vital for these households in allowing them to access consistent medical care and maintain their health. Furthermore, secure housing can be a platform for improved quality of life.
Ninety percent of HOPWA funds are distributed by formula to cities and states based on the number of AIDS cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. HUD's formula grants are managed by 138 local and state jurisdictions, which coordinate AIDS housing efforts with other HUD and community resources. Overall, these resources assist over 60,000 households annually to provide stable housing and reduced risks of homelessness for those living with HIV and other challenges."
05/31/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-085.cfm,"HUD Makes $109 Million Available to Revitalize Housing, Communities","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is making available $109 million in grants to revitalize public and HUD-assisted housing and transform communities. These grants are offered through HUD's Choice Neighborhoods Program, a redevelopment approach that provides communities with tools to revitalize hard-hit communities into vibrant, opportunity-rich neighborhoods. Read HUD's Notice of Funding Availability.
""The Choice Neighborhoods program is critical to building stronger, safer neighborhoods that thrive and provide ladders of opportunity for hard working families,"" said Donovan. ""We look forward to working with community leaders across the country to expand this program, while supporting President Obama's proven tools that strengthen and support our nation's hard working communities.""
The grantees join forces with HUD's team, local residents and leaders in city government, business, philanthropy, law enforcement, education, and many other fields to transform struggling neighborhoods into thriving communities where families will choose to live. Choice Neighborhoods is focused on three core goals:
Housing: Replace distressed public and assisted housing with high-quality mixed-income housing that is well-managed and responsive to the needs of the surrounding neighborhood. People: Improve educational outcomes and intergenerational mobility for youth with services and supports delivered directly to youth and their families. Neighborhood: Create the conditions necessary for public and private reinvestment in distressed neighborhoods to offer the kinds of amenities and assets, including safety, good schools, and commercial activity, that are important to families' choices about their community.
• Housing: Replace distressed public and assisted housing with high-quality mixed-income housing that is well-managed and responsive to the needs of the surrounding neighborhood.
• People: Improve educational outcomes and intergenerational mobility for youth with services and supports delivered directly to youth and their families.
• Neighborhood: Create the conditions necessary for public and private reinvestment in distressed neighborhoods to offer the kinds of amenities and assets, including safety, good schools, and commercial activity, that are important to families' choices about their community.
HUD's commitment to teamwork means local residents and leaders are leading the way in revitalizing their communities. To accomplish these core goals, communities must have in place a comprehensive neighborhood revitalization strategy, or Transformation Plan. This Transformation Plan is the guiding document for the revitalization of the public and/or assisted housing units, while simultaneously directing the transformation of the surrounding neighborhood and positive outcomes for families.
Choice Neighborhoods Implementation grants are available for public housing authorities, local governments, nonprofit organizations, tribal entities, and for profit developers that apply jointly with a public entity to extend neighborhood transformation efforts beyond public and/or assisted housing. The program helps communities transform neighborhoods by revitalizing severely distressed public and/or HUD-assisted multi-family housing and investing and leveraging investments in well-functioning services, high quality public schools and education programs, high quality early learning programs and services, public assets, public transportation, and improved access to jobs.
Since 2010, HUD has awarded nine Choice Neighborhoods Implementation grants, for a combined $231 million, to stimulate neighborhood revitalization in Boston, Chicago, New Orleans, San Francisco, Seattle (two grants), Cincinnati, San Antonio and Tampa. These grants have also generated nearly $2 billion in leveraged funding that significantly impacts the transformation of these communities. More resources are available to invest in neighborhoods - from businesses, foundations and other sources.
Choice Neighborhoods is among other federal programs that supports President Obama's goal to build Ladders of Opportunity for those willing to work hard and that will provide a fair shot at reaching their full potential in life. This vision builds on the work that has been done by the Neighborhood Revitalization Initiative, an interagency partnership between HUD, the Department of Education, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice, and Treasury, since 2009. Through a variety of interventions, the Ladders of Opportunity plan will help community partners rebuild neighborhoods, expand early learning opportunities, create pathways to jobs, and strengthen families.
Applicants have until September 10, 2013 to apply for FY 2013 Choice Neighborhoods Implementation grants. HUD anticipates awarding four grants with a maximum award of $30 million each. Applicants must submit their applications electronically through www.grants.gov."
06/04/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-086.cfm,HUD Issues New Guidance to Encourage Participation in State Efforts to Assist Individuals Moving Out of Institutions and Into Housing,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today issued new guidance to HUD-assisted housing providers on how they can support state and local Olmstead efforts to increase the integrated housing opportunities for individuals with disabilities who are transitioning from, or at serious risk of entering, institutions and other restrictive, segregated settings. Read HUD's new guidance.
Olmstead refers to the 1999 Supreme Court landmark decision, Olmstead v. L.C., which affirmed that the unjustified segregation of individuals with disabilities is an illegal form of discrimination. Following the Olmstead decision, many states are working hard to assist individuals living in institutions and other segregated settings to move to integrated, community-based settings where they can receive the health care and long-term services and supports they need. Many of these efforts, though, are confounded by a lack of integrated and affordable housing options for persons with disabilities.
HUD's new guidance encourages public housing agencies and other HUD-assisted housing providers to consider the housing needs of their individual communities and their state and to partner with state and local governments to provide additional community-based, integrated housing opportunities. HUD's guidance is consistent with efforts across federal agencies and in many states to provide appropriate health care and related supportive services for individuals with disabilities in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs.
""There is a tremendous need for affordable housing where individuals with disabilities are able to live and be part of the very fabric of their communities,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""HUD is committed to offering housing options that enable individuals with disabilities to live in the most integrated settings possible and to fully participate in community life.""
The guidance announced today affirms HUD's commitment that individuals with disabilities, like all persons, should have meaningful choice and self-determination in housing and in the health care and related support services they receive. For this reason, HUD is exploring how it can fund additional integrated housing units scattered throughout communities and provide a greater range of meaningful housing choices for individuals with disabilities. HUD is also exploring how existing HUD-assisted housing can provide individuals with disabilities increased opportunities to exercise autonomy, independence, and self-determination in living arrangements that have the comforts and qualities of home.
While HUD's guidance will be helpful to individuals with disabilities and anyone engaged in the funding, development or operation of housing, the scope of this guidance is limited to HUD funding and programs. Recipients of HUD funds include, but are not limited, to: states, units of local government; public housing agencies; and developers of multifamily properties. Recipients do not include the individual beneficiaries of HUD-funded programs and activities.
Background
Individuals with disabilities have historically faced discrimination that limits their opportunity to live independently in the community and requires them to live in institutions and other segregated settings where they are generally denied many of the most basic freedoms that individuals without disabilities take for granted. The Supreme Court's decision in Olmstead acknowledged that segregating individuals with disabilities in institutional settings deprives them of the opportunity to participate in their communities, interact with individuals who do not have disabilities, and make their own day-to-day choices; it also recognized that unnecessary institutionalization stigmatizes people with disabilities, reinforcing misperceptions about their capacities and negative stereotypes. Thus, the promise of Olmstead is that people with disabilities be given meaningful opportunities to live, work, and receive services in integrated settings.
The Olmstead decision—and subsequent voluntary Olmstead planning and implementation, litigation by groups representing individuals with disabilities, and Department of Health and Human Services and Department of Justice enforcement efforts—is creating a dramatic shift in the way services are delivered to individuals with disabilities. Historically, state health and long-term care systems have been heavily weighted toward using institutions, hospitals, nursing homes, adult care facilities, and other restrictive, segregated settings to provide long-term services and supports for individuals with disabilities. Today, due to Olmstead enforcement and voluntary compliance efforts, states are ""rebalancing"" health care delivery systems by shifting away from an overreliance on providing long-term services and supports to individuals with disabilities in institutions and moving towards a greater reliance on home- and community-based services. For many states, efforts to comply with Olmstead by moving people out of institutions and into the community are severely challenged by a lack of integrated housing options for individuals with disabilities.
HUD has made significant progress towards providing integrated housing opportunities for individuals with disabilities. For example, HUD's new Section 811 Project Rental Assistance Demonstration program supports integrated housing for qualified individuals with disabilities. In response to the need for housing tied to rebalancing initiatives, HUD also carved out funding from a 2009 Congressional Appropriation for housing choice vouchers to aid non-elderly persons with disabilities as they transition from an institution to the community. In addition, HUD's various rental assistance programs, and homeless assistance programs also have the potential to provide integrated housing opportunities for low-income and very-low income persons with disabilities.
Donovan added: ""HUD will continue to work with the Department of Justice, the Department of Health and Human Services, Congress, our grantees, and disability rights organizations to ensure that HUD programs provide meaningful access to integrated housing opportunities for the individuals with disabilities we serve."""
06/06/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-087.cfm,HUD Settles Claim Alleging Bank of America and Fannie Mae Discriminated Against Loan Applicant with Disabilities,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has reached a Conciliation Agreement with Bank of America and Fannie Mae, settling allegations that the Charlotte, NC-based lender and Fannie Mae violated the Fair Housing Act by denyinga borrower's application to modify her mortgage loan because she did not provide sufficient information about the nature of her disability. The woman was applying for a loan modification through the Obama Administration's Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP).
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to deny or discriminate in the terms and conditions of a mortgage or loan modification based on disability, race, color, religion, national origin, sex, or familial status.
""People with disabilities should not have to answer unnecessary questions about the nature of their disability when seeking a loan modification,"" said Bryan Greene, HUD General Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will continue to take action against lenders that subject persons with disabilities to discriminatory practices.""
According to the complaint, a San Bruno, CA, woman applied for a loan modification at Bank of America that would have reduced her interest rate and made it easier for her to pay her mortgage after her disability caused her to miss several months of work. During her extended leave of absence, the woman used her savings to pay her mortgage. Fearing that she would not be able to continue paying her mortgage without a lower interest rate, the woman applied for the loan modification, citing her physical ""hardship.""
In responding to her request, a loan officer with the bank asked her to provide documentation relating to her medical condition. The woman provided the loan officer with a letter from her physician, a current medical bill, and a letter from her employer certifying her approved leave of absence due to her disability. Still, the bank denied her application, allegedly telling her that she had not provided sufficient information about the nature of her disability. Even after the woman provided another letter from her physician and insurance records showing her medical treatment between 2007 and 2011, the bank reportedly denied her modification application and Fannie Mae allegedly stated that her doctor's letters and other documentation were insufficient to show that she was permanently disabled.
Under the terms of the agreement, Bank of America will pay the woman $22,449, which includes $19,349 to cover the approximate closing costs on a refinance loan, and agreed to follow HAMP and Fannie Mae's servicing guidelines. Bank of America will also provide fair lending training to its newly-hired employees. In addition, Fannie Mae will pay the woman $3,400.
Persons who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to www.hud.gov/fairhousing, or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, which can be accessed through Apple devices, such as the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch."
06/06/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-088.cfm,HUD Announces Resolution of REO Issues with Wells Fargo; Collaboration Will Focus on Investment in Communities,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced today that Wells Fargo Bank N.A., the National Fair Housing Alliance, 13 private fair housing organizations and Acting Assistant Secretary Bryan Greene have reached an agreement through which Wells Fargo will invest in efforts designed to help improve housing in minority neighborhoods that have been hard hit by the foreclosure crisis. As part of the agreement, Wells Fargo has committed to invest a total of $39 million in 45 communities across the country through various programs to support homeownership, neighborhood stabilization, property rehabilitation and housing development.
Wells Fargo also has committed to ongoing enhancements in its best practices regarding the maintenance and marketing of Real Estate Owned (REO) properties after foreclosure. This includes use of a revised Real Estate Broker Procedure Manual and property inspection checklist, and an enhanced training program for real estate brokers and agents who list REO properties. Further, Wells Fargo staff who are responsible for managing REO will also take the training.
In addition, Wells Fargo will extend the amount of time that individual REO properties will be exclusively available for purchase by an owner-occupant or a non-profit organization to increase the chance that the house will be acquired by an owner-occupant.
""HUD, NFHA and Wells Fargo are committed to revitalizing and creating homeownership opportunities in minority communities devastated by foreclosures,"" said Bryan Greene, HUD General Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Wells Fargo's investment demonstrates an ongoing commitment to stabilizing African-American and Hispanic neighborhoods in a way that advances equal housing opportunities and HUD is committed to working collaboratively with Wells Fargo to support the effort.""
""NFHA is looking forward to working in partnership with Wells Fargo to make sure that all communities have a chance at a fair recovery,"" said Shanna L. Smith, President and CEO of the National Fair Housing Alliance. ""We are thrilled to see Wells Fargo's renewed efforts and leadership in this area. Many neighborhoods all across the country have been seriously damaged by REO homes left un-attended. This partnership will help to get some of those neighborhoods back on their feet.""
""This represents a significant commitment by Wells Fargo, HUD and NFHA to invest in programs that will strengthen minority communities affected by foreclosure,"" said J.K. Huey, Senior Vice President at Wells Fargo. ""We appreciate the perspectives and collaboration of NFHA and HUD, along with their efforts to shape the initiatives resulting from this agreement. Today's announcement is consistent with our longstanding commitment to homeownership, fair and responsible servicing, and investing in the communities we serve.""
$27 million of the agreement will be used to support neighborhoods in 19 areas through NFHA and its member organizations in the identified cities. Those cities are Washington, DC; Baltimore, MD; Philadelphia, PA; Oakland, Richmond, and Concord, CA; Dayton, OH; Miami, FL; Dallas, TX; Grand Rapids, MI; Atlanta, GA; Prince George's County, MD; Charleston, SC; Orlando, FL; Indianapolis, IN; Milwaukee, WI; Metropolitan Chicago, IL; Homewood and Dolton, IL; Toledo, OH; Denver, CO; and Baton Rouge, LA. A separate agreement calls for investment of $450,000 in Jacksonville, Florida to be administered by the Jacksonville Area Legal Aid, Inc.
Under the agreement, an additional $11.5 million will support neighborhoods in an additional 25 cities. Those cities are Austin, TX, Bakersfield, CA, Detroit, MI, Fort Lauderdale, FL, Fresno, CA, Houston, TX, Kansas City, MO, Las Vegas, NV, Los Angeles, CA, Memphis, TN, Modesto, CA, New York, NY, Phoenix, AZ, Riverside, CA, Sacramento, CA, San Antonio, TX, San Diego, CA, San Jose, CA, Santa Ana, CA, St. Louis, MO-IL, Stockton, CA, Tampa, FL, Vallejo, CA, Virginia Beach, VA, and West Palm Beach, FL."
06/07/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-090.cfm,Obama Administration Releases May Housing Scorecard,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of the Treasury today released the May edition of the Obama Administration's Housing Scorecard - a comprehensive report on the nation's housing market. Data continue to show important progress across many key indicators—as the annual home price increase is the highest since the housing bubble burst in mid-2006 and purchases of new and existing homes remain strong—although officials caution that a full housing recovery will take more time. The Housing Scorecard is available online at www.hud.gov/scorecard.
""As the May housing scorecard indicates, the Obama Administration's policies and actions over the last four years to speed housing recovery are continuing to show important signs of progress,"" said HUD Deputy Assistant Secretary for Economic Affairs Kurt Usowski. ""In the first quarter of 2013, homeowners' equity grew by more than $815 billion, reaching its highest level since the first quarter of 2008. Despite the positive news, we have important work ahead since there are so many families and individuals still 'underwater' with mortgage balances higher than their home's value.""
Included in this month's Making Home Affordable Program Report (www.treasury.gov/initiatives/financial-stability/reports/Pages/Making-Home-Affordable-Program-Performance-Report.aspx) are detailed assessments for the largest mortgage servicers participating in the program evaluating their performance for the first quarter of 2013. These Servicer Assessments - first issued in June 2011 and published quarterly - show that servicers continue to focus attention on areas identified in previous program reviews, resulting in improved program implementation and better outcomes for homeowners. Last week, the Administration announced an extension of the Making Home Affordable Program - which includes the Home Affordable Modification Program or HAMP - through December 31, 2015. The Making Home Affordable Program is a critical part of the Administration's efforts to fuel the housing recovery and help homeowners avoid foreclosure.
""We have kept the pressure on the mortgage industry to step up its efforts, which has helped millions of families access relief in a historic housing crisis,"" said Treasury Assistant Secretary for Financial Stability Tim Massad. ""Making Home Affordable provides standards and accountability for the mortgage industry that will now help additional homeowners avoid foreclosure through 2015.""
Since inception of the Making Home Affordable Program, Treasury has required participating servicers to take specific actions to improve their processes through ongoing program reviews. The quarterly Servicer Assessments summarize performance in three categories of program implementation: identifying and contacting homeowners; homeowner evaluation and assistance; and program reporting, management and governance. Results for the first quarter of 2013 show that, although servicer performance can fluctuate from quarter to quarter, servicers are demonstrating continued improvement in program implementation, including:
Servicers are more effectively evaluating homeowners under program eligibility criteria as seen in the ""second look disagree"" category, which reflects the rate at which program reviews disagree with the servicers' decision to find a homeowner ineligible for assistance. In the first quarter, the average second look disagree rate for the top servicers was below one percent.
• Servicers are more effectively evaluating homeowners under program eligibility criteria as seen in the ""second look disagree"" category, which reflects the rate at which program reviews disagree with the servicers' decision to find a homeowner ineligible for assistance. In the first quarter, the average second look disagree rate for the top servicers was below one percent.
Mortgage servicers continue to accurately calculate homeowner income, which is used to determine a homeowner's eligibility and modified payment amount under the program. The majority of servicers have income calculation error rates below the established benchmark (with two servicers at zero percent error rates).
• Mortgage servicers continue to accurately calculate homeowner income, which is used to determine a homeowner's eligibility and modified payment amount under the program. The majority of servicers have income calculation error rates below the established benchmark (with two servicers at zero percent error rates).
All servicers will need to demonstrate progress in any areas identified in subsequent program reviews. Additionally, all servicers have been directed to strengthen implementation in a few key areas, including timely and accurate reporting of program data and ensuring the timely assignment of a single point of contact (SPOC) to homeowners.
The May Housing Scorecard features key data on the health of the housing market and the impact of the Administration's foreclosure prevention programs, including:
The Administration's foreclosure mitigation programs continue to benefit millions of homeowners as the housing market recovers from an unprecedented crisis. More than 1.6 million homeowner assistance actions have taken place through the Making Home Affordable Program, including more than 1.1 million permanent modifications through HAMP, while the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) has offered more than 1.8 million loss mitigation and early delinquency interventions. The Administration's programs continue to encourage improved standards and processes in the industry, with HOPE Now lenders offering families and individuals more than 3.6 million proprietary mortgage modifications through March. Homeowners in HAMP continue to benefit from meaningful payment relief increasing the long-term likelihood of avoiding foreclosure. As of April, more than 1.1 million homeowners have received a permanent modification through HAMP, saving approximately $547 on their mortgage payments each month - a 39 percent savings from their previous payment. In April, 67 percent of homeowners with eligible non-GSE mortgages benefitted from principal reduction with their HAMP modification. Homeowners currently in permanent HAMP modifications have been granted an estimated $10.2 billion in total principal reduction.

06/11/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-091.cfm,Racial and Ethnic Minorities Face More Subtle Housing Discrimination,"WASHINGTON - Blatant acts of housing discrimination faced by minority homeseekers continue to decline in the U.S., yet more subtle forms of housing denial stubbornly persist, according to a new summary study released today by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Urban Institute. Housing Discrimination Against Racial and Ethnic Minorities 2012 (www.huduser.org/portal/publications/fairhsg/hsg_discrimination_2012.html) finds African-Americans, Hispanics and Asians learn about fewer housing options than equally qualified whites.
Real estate agents and rental housing providers recommend and show fewer available homes and apartments to minority families, thereby increasing their costs and restricting their housing options. The study concludes this is a national, not a regional, phenomenon.
""Fewer minorities today may be getting the door slammed in their faces, but we continue to see evidence of housing discrimination that can limit a family's housing, economic and educational opportunities,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""It's clear we still have work to do to end housing discrimination once and for all.""
""The forms of discrimination documented by this study are very difficult for victims to detect,"" said the Urban Institute's Margery Turner. ""To detect housing discrimination today, HUD and local fair housing organizations need to conduct proactive testing, especially in the sales market, where discrimination appears higher than in the rental market.""
This is the fourth in a series of national studies sponsored by HUD roughly each decade to measure housing discrimination in rental and sales markets, since 1979. It finds that while minorities today are rarely denied an appointment to see an advertised unit, less blatant forms of unequal treatment persist.
""The study represents a glass that's half full. While discrimination may not be as obvious as it was in the 1960s, the study reminds us that we still aren't living up to the principles upon which this nation was founded,"" said Bryan Greene, HUD Acting Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD is committed to ensuring that every American has equal access to housing opportunities.""
The Urban Institute, which conducted the study, employed a ""paired testing"" methodology in which researchers compared the treatment of white and minority homeseekers in a nationally representative sample of 28 metropolitan areas.* Of the more than 8,000 paired tests, two trained individuals (one white and the other black, Hispanic, or Asian), contacted a housing provider to inquire about a unit randomly selected from recently advertised homes and apartments. The two testers in each pair were matched on gender, age and family composition and assigned the same financial characteristics. With each tester presenting as unambiguously and equally well qualified to rent or buy the advertised unit, testers independently recorded the treatment they experienced, including information about all the homes or apartments recommended and shown.
Key findings of the report include:
Taking into account the ability to make an appointment, the availability of units and homes, and the agent's willingness to show units, minority renters and homebuyers are told about and shown fewer homes and apartments.
• Taking into account the ability to make an appointment, the availability of units and homes, and the agent's willingness to show units, minority renters and homebuyers are told about and shown fewer homes and apartments.
Black
Black renters who contact agents about recently advertised housing units learn about 11% fewer available units and are shown roughly 4% fewer units. Black homebuyers who contact agents about recently advertised homes for sale learn about 17% fewer available homes and are shown about 18% fewer units.
• Black renters who contact agents about recently advertised housing units learn about 11% fewer available units and are shown roughly 4% fewer units.
• Black homebuyers who contact agents about recently advertised homes for sale learn about 17% fewer available homes and are shown about 18% fewer units.
Asian
Asian renters who contact agents about recently advertised housing units learn about 10% fewer available units and are shown nearly 7% fewer units. Asian homebuyers who contact agents about recently advertised homes for sale learn about 15% fewer available homes and are shown nearly 19% fewer units.
• Asian renters who contact agents about recently advertised housing units learn about 10% fewer available units and are shown nearly 7% fewer units.

• Hispanic renters who contact agents about recently advertised housing units learn about 12% fewer available units and are shown roughly 7% fewer units.
• The difference in treatment for Hispanic homebuyers is not statistically significant.
Among the measures of change over the most recent decade, only discrimination for availability of the advertised unit has declined. Black renters today appear less likely than a decade ago to be told that advertised units are unavailable. Asian renters are more likely than a decade ago to be shown fewer units but they are less likely to experience adverse treatment when making future arrangements with the agent. Changes in other measures of rental discrimination are not statistically significant. For changes in sales discrimination over the most recent decade, the authors find less evidence of meaningful progress. The only statistically significant change is for Hispanics, who are less likely than a decade ago to be denied financing help compared to equally-qualified white homebuyers."
06/12/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-092.cfm,HUD Announces $563 Million to Support Affordable Housing in Hundreds of Native American and Alaskan Communities,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today awarded $563 million to 353 American Indian and Alaskan Native entities that represent 539 tribes across the U.S. Provided through HUD's Indian Housing Block Grant (IHBG) Program, these funds are distributed annually to eligible Indian tribes or their tribally designated housing entities for a broad range of affordable housing activities (see local grants).
""Hardworking American families in tribal communities should be able to live in communities where they have a fair shot to reach their potential,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""The resources provided today will give these tribal communities the tools to maintain quality housing, prevent overcrowding, improve public safety and provide other basic building blocks of security and success.""
IHBG funds primarily benefit hardworking families, living on reservations or in other Native American communities, who don't have the financial resources to maintain good homes, schools, or other key contributors to economic security. The amount of each grant is based on a formula that considers local needs and housing units under management by the tribe or designated entity.
Indian communities can use the funding for a variety of housing activities, including building affordable housing; providing assistance to existing housing that was developed under the Indian Housing Program authorized by the U.S. Housing Act of 1937; or other activities that create new approaches to provide more affordable housing for Native Americans. The funding is also used to offer housing services to eligible families and individuals; and establish crime prevention and safety measures. The block grant approach to housing was established by the Native American Housing Assistance and Self Determination Act of 1996 (NAHASDA)."
06/13/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-093.cfm,Housing Authorities to Connect Fathers and Children Who Live in Public Housing,"WASHINGTON - Nearly 300 public housing authorities in 36 states and the District of Columbia plan to host free events to connect fathers and their children this weekend. For the third consecutive year public housing authorities across the country are gearing up to participate in the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Father's Day Initiative. Modeled after a 2010 New York City Housing campaign and following President Obama's lead in starting a national discussion on responsible fatherhood, the initiative aims to strengthen the bond between children and their fathers, who are often absent from the lives of their children who live in public housing, and also connect fathers to economic, health and education resources. (see local participants)
""I applaud the agencies, families and fathers that support this initiative each year,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan, a father of two. ""We know impact that hardworking parents have on their children's lives and the challenges families can face without committed fathers. As the president says, our children need us to be present and to give them our best, no matter what is going on our lives. That's what we are asking fathers and families to do this Father's Day and we are happy to have partners from agencies around the country joining us to do that.""
Local housing authorities will hold events on Saturday, June 15th and throughout the month to celebrate fatherhood and the importance of dads being connected with their children who live in public housing or surrounding communities. Housing authorities will offer activities for fathers and their children, and also connect these men to economic development resources. HUD hopes these events will encourage fathers to stay connected with their children beyond Father's Day. For example, fathers can attend a ""Back to School Night"" or other school or community activities.
HUD's Father's Day initiative is part of a larger Obama Administration effort to promote responsible fatherhood. The National Conversation on Responsible Fatherhood and Strong Communities focuses on fatherhood and at-risk youth - a priority for the White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships.
The local offices of federal agencies, such as the U.S. Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, Agriculture, Education and Justice, will offer on-site information and servicesfor attendees. In some cities, NFL and NBA players will even join in on the Father's Day festivities.
Local authorities have partnered with organizations, such as the Boys & Girls Club of America, Legal Services Corporation and the National Fatherhood Initiative (www.fatherhood.org/Page.aspx?pid=192) (NFI), to host events that celebrate fatherhood. Created in 1994, NFI aims to raise awareness about the importance of having fathers present in their children's life.
According to U.S. Census data, 24 million American children live in a home without a father. NFI has also found that children in father-less homes are five times more likely to live below the poverty line. Furthermore, these children are more likely to drop out of school or be incarcerated.
When addressing the importance of fathers, President Obama once said, ""Our children don't need us to be superheroes. They don't need us to be perfect. They do need us to be present. They need us to show up and give it our best shot, no matter what else is going on in our lives. They need us to show them - not just with words, but with deeds - that they, those kids, are always our first priority.""
HUD's national Father's Day 2013 campaign is in part modeled after the New York City Housing Authority 2010 Fatherhood Initiative. Housing authorities throughout the city hosted day-long events, which included activities for families and parenting workshops."
06/18/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-094.cfm,HUD Awards $40 Million in Housing Counseling Grants,"WASHINGTON - As part of its continuing effort to assist families and individuals with their housing needs and to prevent future foreclosures, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced more than $40 million in housing counseling grants to 334 national, regional and local organizations. As a result of these grants and the additional funding they help leverage, more than 1.6 million households will have a greater opportunity to find housing, make more informed housing choices or keep their current homes. See list of all counseling agencies awarded funding today.
""Make no mistake: these grants will do a lot of good,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""The HUD-approved counseling agencies this funding supports are crucial in helping families manage their money, navigate the homebuying process, and secure their financial futures. The evidence is clear that housing counseling works. These grants are a smart investment to help families and individuals find and keep housing which helps promote neighborhood stability in the long term.""
More than $38 million in grant funds will directly support the housing counseling services provided by 27 national and regional organizations, 8 multi-state organizations, 22 State Housing Finance Agencies (SHFAs) and 277 local housing counseling agencies. In addition, HUD is awarding $2 million to two national organizations to train housing counselors who will receive the instruction and certification necessary to effectively assist families with their housing needs.
Working in consultation with housing counseling industry stakeholders, HUD's new Office of Housing Counseling substantially streamlined the application process for these grants. A number of procedural improvements were made to the application process and program requirements, which encourage the development of efficient and effective counseling programs and reduce the administrative burden on applicants. HUD awards annual grants under the housing counseling program through a competitive process. Organizations that apply for grants must be HUD-approved and are subject to monitoring and oversight to maintain their HUD-approved status.
National and regional agencies distribute much of HUD's housing counseling grant funding to community-based organizations that assist low- and moderate-income families to improve their housing conditions. In addition, these larger organizations help improve the quality of housing counseling services and enhance coordination among counseling providers. Read a summary of each grant, organized by state.
HUD studies show the effectiveness of housing counseling. Last year, HUD released two reports on the impact of HUD-approved housing counseling for families who purchase their first homes and those struggling to prevent foreclosure. In both studies, HUD found housing counseling significantly improved the likelihood homeowners remained in their homes.
Grant recipients utilize funding to address the full range of families' housing counseling needs. This includes helping homebuyers and homeowners realistically evaluate their readiness for a home purchase, understand their financing and downpayment options, and navigate what can be an extremely confusing and difficult process. Grantees also help households find affordable rental housing and offer financial literacy training to individuals and families struggling to repair credit problems that restrict their housing options. In addition to providing counseling to homebuyers and renters, these organizations assist homeless persons in finding the transitional housing they need to move toward a permanent place to live. Finally, grantees also assist senior citizens seeking reverse mortgages or Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECM). These agencies provide counseling for the rapidly growing number of elderly homeowners who seek to convert equity in their homes into income that can be used to pay for home improvements, medical costs, and other living expenses.
Housing counseling agencies support fair housing by assisting borrowers in reviewing their loan documentation, to avoid potential mortgage scams, unreasonably high interest rates, inflated appraisals, unaffordable repayment terms, and other conditions that can result in a loss of equity, increased debt, default, and even foreclosure. Likewise, foreclosure prevention counseling helps homeowners facing delinquency or default employ strategies, including expense reduction, negotiation with lenders and loan servicers, and loss mitigation, to avoid foreclosure.
HUD's new mobile app (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hud-counselor-lookup/id568893389?mt=8) allows smartphone and tablet users to locate housing counselors in their own area."

BUILDING PERMITS
Privately-owned housing units authorized by building permits in May were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 974,000. This is 3.1 percent (±0.9%) below the revised April rate of 1,005,000, but is 20.8 percent (±1.3%) above the May 2012 estimate of 806,000. Single-family authorizations in May were at a rate of 622,000; this is 1.3 percent (±1.1%) above the revised April figure of 614,000. Authorizations of units in buildings with five units or more were at a rate of 325,000 in May.
HOUSING STARTS
Privately-owned housing starts in May were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 914,000. This is 6.8 percent (±10.1%)* above the revised April estimate of 856,000 and is 28.6 percent (±14.4%) above the May 2012 rate of 711,000. Single-family housing starts in May were at a rate of 599,000; this is 0.3 percent (±8.7%)* above the revised April figure of 597,000. The May rate for units in buildings with five units or more was 306,000.

EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take 2 months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, 4 months for total starts, and 6 months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as non-sampling error including bias and variance from response, non-reporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (3.2%) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90-percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised about three percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found on our web site listed above.
* 90% confidence interval includes zero. The Census Bureau does not have sufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero.

06/18/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-096.cfm,HUD Announces First-Ever Same-Sex Housing Discrimination Study,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today released the nation's first-ever national study examining housing discrimination against same-sex couples in the private rental market. The study, An Estimate of Housing Discrimination Against Same-Sex Couples (www.huduser.org/portal/publications/fairhsg/discrim_samesex.html), measures the treatment same-sex couples receive from rental agents when inquiring about apartments advertised online, as compared to how otherwise similar heterosexual couples are treated.
According to HUD's study, same-sex couples experience unequal treatment more often than heterosexual couples when responding to internet ads for rental units, and findings show that gay male couples experience more discrimination than lesbian couples.
""President Obama and this administration have been unmatched in our efforts to ensure equal and fair treatment of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) persons and communities,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""Following the president's lead, HUD has taken historic steps in the area of fair housing to ensure that we fulfill our nation's commitment to equality. As this study shows, we need to continue our efforts to ensure that everyone is treated the same when it comes to finding a home to call their own, regardless of their sexual orientation.""
""A person's sexual orientation or gender identity should not be a reason to receive unfavorable treatment when searching for housing,"" said Bryan Greene, HUD Acting Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD is committed to making sure that LGBT individuals have equal access to housing opportunities.""
HUD's study is based on nearly 7,000 email tests conducted in 50 metropolitan markets across the country between June and October of 2011. For each paired test, two emails were sent to the housing provider regarding the unit advertised online. The only difference between the emails was whether the couple was same-sex or heterosexual. Unfavorable treatment was measured by whether the tester was told the unit was available, asked to contact the landlord, invited to the see the apartment, or received any response at all.
Key findings of the study showed that:
Same-sex couples experience discrimination in the online rental housing market, relative to heterosexual couples. Adverse treatment is found primarily in the form of same-sex couples receiving fewer responses to the email inquiry than heterosexual couples. States with legislative protections show slightly more adverse treatment for gays and lesbians than in states without protections. Adverse treatment of same-sex couples is present in every metropolitan area where tests were conducted, but no clear-cut pattern exists in the magnitude of adverse treatment by metropolitan size.
• Same-sex couples experience discrimination in the online rental housing market, relative to heterosexual couples.
• Adverse treatment is found primarily in the form of same-sex couples receiving fewer responses to the email inquiry than heterosexual couples.
• States with legislative protections show slightly more adverse treatment for gays and lesbians than in states without protections.
• Adverse treatment of same-sex couples is present in every metropolitan area where tests were conducted, but no clear-cut pattern exists in the magnitude of adverse treatment by metropolitan size.
The Fair Housing Act makes it illegal to discriminate in rental, sales and lending on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, disability and familial status, however it does not include sexual orientation or gender identity as protected classes. Nonetheless, 20 states and the District of Columbia, and more than 150 cities, towns and counties across the nation have laws that specifically prohibit discrimination against LGBT individuals.
Recently, HUD issued new guidance that treats discrimination based on gender nonconformity or sex stereotyping as sex discrimination under the Fair Housing Act, and instructs HUD staff to inform individuals filing complaints about state and local agencies that have LGBT-inclusive nondiscrimination laws. In addition, on February 3, 2012, HUD published a final rule, ""Equal Access to Housing in HUD Programs Regardless of Sexual Orientation or Gender Identity"", which requires HUD-funded and HUD-insured housing providers and FHA-approved lenders to provide equal access without regard to sexual orientation, gender identity, and marital status.
This study serves as the initial step toward future research on same-sex housing discrimination. Recommendations for upcoming studies include in-person testing, examination of legislative protections at the local jurisdictional level (rather than only at the state level), and tests for discrimination against transgender people to further examine difference in treatment between same-sex and heterosexual couples in states without legislative protections."
06/19/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-097.cfm,Mortgage Settlement Monitor Reports Eight Fails in Testing Results,"WASHINGTON - The nation's largest mortgage servicers have failed eight of the servicing standards in the National Mortgage Settlement according to a report (https://www.mortgageoversight.com/reports/summary-of-compliance/) released by Joseph A. Smith, Jr., Monitor of the National Mortgage Settlement. The Monitor's testing through the end of last year resulted in three testing fails, and there are five additional fails in 2013.
The following is a statement released today by HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan:
""The Independent Monitor's report is a landmark moment in our efforts to reform the servicing industry. For too long, banks have been operating behind closed doors. This report provides the public with a new and transparent look into how banks are treating homeowners. The good news is that gains have been made. The practice of robo-signing—where banks sign off on foreclosures with little or no review—has come to an end. We've also confirmed that the five banks have stopped charging distressed borrowers a fee just to process a loan modification request.
Unfortunately, other abuses shamefully endure. Most notably, these financial institutions consistently fail to send notices and communicate decisions to stakeholders in a timely manner. This is unacceptable. So the five financial institutions are officially on notice; they must correct these problems and pass the Monitor's tests or the Obama administration, along with the bipartisan group of 49 state attorneys general we partnered with on this effort, will fine them up to $5 million for each failure or haul them back into court."""
06/20/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-098.cfm,Donovan Launches Regional Design Competition to Promote Resilience for the Sandy-Affected Region,"WASHINGTON - In an effort to promote resilience for the Sandy-affected region, U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Shaun Donovan, who also chairs the Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force, today launched REBUILD BY DESIGN, a multi-stage regional design competition. The goal of the competition is to attract world-class talent, promote innovation and develop projects that will actually be built. Once the best ideas are identified, HUD will incentivize their implementation using funds made available through the Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) program as well as other public and private funds. Examples of design solutions are expected to range in scope and scale - from large-scale green infrastructure to small-scale residential resiliency retrofits.
The Rockefeller Foundation is the lead funding partner for REBUILD BY DESIGN and will provide support for the analysis and design process. HUD and The Rockefeller Foundation have coordinated closely following several catastrophic events including Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and especially Sandy. The Rockefeller Foundation's support of the REBUILD BY DESIGN competition builds upon their strong commitment to promoting urban resilience through a $100 million investment, which includes their recent announcement of the '100 Resilient Cities Centennial Challenge.'
The National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) serves as a special partner, providing critical expertise and guidance to shape and launch REBUILD BY DESIGN. NEA's experience investing in and facilitating place-based work through the Our Town and Mayor's Institute on City Design initiatives, as well as NEA's history with supporting and facilitating design competitions, will help ensure the success of REBUILD BY DESIGN.
""The competition process will deliver a better understanding of regional interdependencies and foster regional coordination and resilience across the United States,"" said Donovan. ""Natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy do not respect state or local borders, and we too must know no boundaries-both literally and figuratively-as we think about our plans for the future.""
""As globalization, urbanization, and climate change converge, shocks such as Hurricane Sandy will only increase in frequency, scale and impact,"" said Judith Rodin, President, The Rockefeller Foundation. ""As a result, we must come together to design around these problems to build greater resilience within our cities. REBUILD BY DESIGN gives us the dynamic opportunity to uncover the innovative collaboration and connections that will allow us to strengthen our resilience as a city, a region, and a nation.""
""The public sector is too often locked into being reactive to crises,"" said NEA Acting Chairman Joan Shigekawa. ""With REBUILD BY DESIGN, Secretary Donovan and HUD are providing vital and forward looking leadership by inviting the nation's best design thinking and analysis to inform public investment.""
REBUILD BY DESIGN will center on four focus areas: coastal communities, high-density urban environments, ecological networks and a fourth category that will include other innovative questions and proposals.
The competition will have a region-wide focus to help provide solutions to problems that are larger or more complex than individual towns have the capacity to solve themselves. The regional focus will also help provide a better understanding of the many interconnected systems (infrastructure, ecological, climate, economic and others) in the Sandy-affected region. Design teams will start with regional analyses to understand major vulnerabilities and then, through the collaborative design process begin to focus on local implementation and key projects for improving the region's resilience.
REBUILD BY DESIGN will have four stages:
Stage 1: Call for concept proposals and selection of 5-10 teams June 2013 - July 2013 Attract and form 5-10 teams with world-class expertise in infrastructure engineering, landscape design, urban design, architecture, land use planning, industrial design, communication, and other fields.
Stage 2: Analysis of the region through collaborative process August 2013 - October 2013 The teams will interact with a wide-range of stakeholders to develop a comprehensive understanding of the region, its interdependencies, key players, and areas that warrant integrated design thinking and solutions.
Stage 3: Development of design solutions and selection of key projects November 2013 - February 2014 Teams will submit their designs in the beginning of February. A jury will select the winners.
Stage 4: Implementation of winning designs and projects Will commence March 2014 Winning design solutions, having been developed in close collaboration with government and stakeholders, will be implemented using public and private funds."

06/26/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-100.cfm,HUD Secretary Announces Disaster Assistance for Alaska Storm Victims,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan today announced HUD will speed federal disaster assistance to the State of Alaska and provide support to homeowners and low-income renters forced from their homes due to recent flooding.
Yesterday, President Obama issued a disaster declaration for Alaska Gateway Regional Educational Attendance Area, Copper River Regional Educational Attendance Area, Lower Yukon Regional Educational Attendance Area, Yukon Flats Regional Educational Attendance Area and Yukon Koyukuk Regional Educational Attendance Area. The President's declaration allows HUD to offer foreclosure relief and other assistance to certain families living in these counties.
""Families who may have been forced from their homes need to know that help is available to begin the rebuilding process,"" said Donovan. ""Whether it's foreclosure relief for FHA-insured families or helping these counties to recover, HUD stands ready to help in any way we can.""

07/02/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-101.cfm,HUD Charges Minnesota Property Owner with Discriminating Against Single Mother and Her Daughter,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is charging a Jackson, Minnesota, landlord with violating the Fair Housing Act for allegedly refusing to rent an apartment to a woman and her young daughter. HUD's charge alleges that the owner refused to rent to the family because he preferred not to rent to families with children.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to refuse to rent or to impose different rental terms on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, disability, or familial status.
""Refusing to rent housing to families with children is against the law unless the property legally qualifies as housing for older persons,"" said Bryan Greene, HUD's Acting Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will continue to take action against property owners who discriminate against prospective tenants because of their family status.""
According to HUD's charge, the woman contacted the owner after seeing an advertisement in a local newspaper for a one-bedroom apartment. When she told the owner that the unit was for her and her one-year-old daughter, the owner allegedly said that he had rented to families before and it ""just doesn't work.""
During HUD's investigation, the owner admitted that he told the woman he preferred to rent the apartment to adults, not families with children. Two weeks after turning the woman down, the owner rented the apartment to an applicant without minor children. The lease included a provision limiting the unit to one person only.
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages to the family. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief to prevent further discrimination, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose fines in order to vindicate the public interest. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages to aggrieved persons.
Persons who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to www.hud.gov/fairhousing, or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, which can be accessed through Apple devices, such as the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch."
07/03/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-103.cfm,HUD Announces Settlement with Baltimore City Housing Authority,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today a settlement agreement with the Housing Authority of Baltimore City (HABC) after a resident complained the housing authority failed to make a reasonable accommodation for a family with a young son with special needs. HABC will pay $150,000 to the public housing resident as part of the Voluntary Compliance Agreement.
The resident alleged that the housing authority failed to grant her request to be transferred to a larger unit that was closer to family support. The resident and her young son are persons with disabilities who needed a larger unit near family members who could assist in caring for them. The Fair Housing Act requires housing providers to make reasonable accommodations in their rules, policies, practices or services when needed to provide persons with disabilities an equal opportunity to use or enjoy a dwelling. In addition, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 makes it unlawful for any federally funded housing program to deny program benefits to an individual based on a disability.
""Requests for reasonable accommodations that are needed by persons with disabilities must be taken seriously and receive timely responses,"" said Jane C.W. Vincent, HUD's Regional Administrator of the mid-Atlantic region. ""HUD will continue to investigate the causes of delays in granting reasonable accommodation requests and take action when we determine that they were unnecessary.""
According to the HUD complaint, the resident made several requests over a four-year period to be transferred to a four-bedroom unit that was closer to her family support system. She also provided doctor's letters indicating that the requested transfer would ameliorate her son's disability and her multiple disabilities. Among other things, her son's doctor recommended a larger unit so that the child, who is susceptible to viral infections due to asthma, would not have to share a bedroom with his siblings. Additionally, the mother raised concerns about mold and pests and the lack of air and heat controls in the two-bedroom unit they occupied at the time. Still, the housing authority failed to grant her requests until several months after she filed a complaint with HUD.
Under the terms of the agreement, HABC will pay the mother $150,000 and pay her attorneys $10,000. To ensure that future reasonable accommodation requests are properly addressed, HABC will also post signage that details its reasonable accommodation policy and procedures, train staff and property managers on how to comply with reasonable accommodation requests, and submit regular reports to HUD on its efforts to promptly respond to reasonable accommodation requests.
Persons who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to www.hud.gov/fairhousing, or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, which can be accessed through Apple devices such as the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch."

This is an increase of 2.3 percent from the $107,500 reported in the 2009 survey. The median purchase price of homes constructed in the past four years was higher at $235,000, down 2.1 percent from the $240,000 reported for new construction in 2009.
The profile released today provides information on the nation's housing costs, mortgages and a variety of other physical and financial characteristics about housing in the U.S. The statistics come from the American Housing Survey, which is sponsored by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau, and is the most comprehensive housing survey in the United States. National data are collected every odd-numbered year and metropolitan area data are collected on a rotating basis. The Census Bureau also released profiles for 29 selected metro areas.
""The last five years remind us how central housing is to each of us personally, to the fiscal health of our cities and counties, and the national economy. For 40 years, the American Housing Survey has provided a unique set of data that connects the detailed characteristics of who is living in homes to the detailed characteristics of the homes themselves,"" said Kurt Usowski, HUD's Deputy Assistant Secretary for Economic Affairs. ""From the American Housing Survey, we can see why people chose to move, how often homes need repairs, and the extent to which housing costs are outpacing income growth. All this information can help inform policymaking around continued recovery in the U.S. and in metropolitan areas around the country.""
""We are pleased to have the opportunity to collaborate with HUD on these profiles,"" said the Census Bureau's Arthur Cresce, Jr., Assistant Division Chief for Housing Characteristics. ""Analysts in government and business study the nation's housing very closely and the AHS yields a wealth of information that can be used by professionals in nearly every field for planning, decision-making, and market research.""
Some highlights for the U.S. include:
Physical Characteristics
The median year occupied homes were built in the U.S. was 1974. Nationally, piped gas was the most prevalent home heating source, used by 50.4 percent of occupied homes. Electricity was used by 35.3 percent. Among owner-occupied homes in the U.S., 46.3 percent had working carbon monoxide detectors. Among all U.S. homes, 72.5 percent of owner-occupied units had central air.

07/12/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-105.cfm,Obama Administration Releases June Housing Scorecard,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of the Treasury today released the June edition of the Obama Administration's Housing Scorecard – a comprehensive report on the nation's housing market. Data continue to show signs that the housing market is strengthening, with home prices continuing to rise and new and existing home sales remaining strong, although officials caution that there is regional variation and the overall economic recovery remains fragile.The full Housing Scorecard is available online at www.hud.gov/scorecard.
""The Obama Administration's efforts to speed the housing recovery are showing continued progress as the June scorecard indicators highlight ongoing improvements throughout the housing market,"" said HUD Deputy Assistant Secretary for Economic Affairs Kurt Usowski. ""Foreclosure starts and completions are down significantly from one year ago; and since January 2012, rising home values have lifted 2.4 million homeowners back above water. That said, we remain cautious because although mortgage delinquencies are trending down, they still remain quite high compared to historic norms.""
""Homeowners who receive help from the Administration's HAMP program continue to show success at avoiding foreclosure, which benefits families, communities and the economy,"" said Treasury Assistant Secretary for Financial Stability Tim Massad. ""HAMP has also put into place important standards for the mortgage servicing industry that have improved outcomes for struggling families more broadly.""
The June Housing Scorecard features key data on the health of the housing market and the impact of the Administration's foreclosure prevention programs, including:
The Administration's foreclosure mitigation programs are providing relief for millions of homeowners as we continue to recover from an unprecedented housing crisis. More than 1.6 million homeowner assistance actions have taken place through the Making Home Affordable Program, including more than 1.2 million permanent modifications through the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP), while the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) has offered more than 1.8 million loss mitigation and early delinquency interventions. The Administration's programs continue to encourage improved standards and processes in the industry, with HOPE Now lenders offering families and individuals more than 3.6 million proprietary mortgage modifications through April. Homeowners in HAMP continue to benefit from significant payment relief increasing the long-term likelihood of avoiding foreclosure. As of May, more than 1.2 million homeowners have received a permanent modification through HAMP, saving approximately $547 on their mortgage payments each month - a 39 percent savings from their previous payment. In May, 69 percent of homeowners with eligible non-GSE mortgages benefitted from principal reduction with their HAMP modification. Homeowners currently in permanent HAMP modifications have been granted an estimated $10.6 billion in total principal reduction.

Also featured this month in the Administration's Housing Scorecard is a regional spotlight on market strength in the Portland, Oregon metropolitan area. The foreclosure crisis in Portland developed later and differently than in other areas of the nation. While home price appreciation during the housing bubble peaked later and rose less steeply in Portland than it did nationally, home prices fell nearly as sharply.
""While Portland's economy was hit harder by the recession than the nation as a whole, it has nonetheless had a somewhat stronger recovery. Portland's housing market is also recovering a bit faster than the national data show for the broader housing market,"" said Usowski. ""As this Regional Spotlight reports, the Administration's efforts have helped nearly 35,000 Portland households avoid foreclosure. But as legal issues that have recently slowed the foreclosure process in Oregon are settled, we still have much to do to reach the many households who still face trouble and to help the Portland market's continuing recovery.""
The Housing Scorecard Regional Spotlight features data on the health of the Portland metropolitan housing market and impact of efforts to help homeowners at the local level including:
Economic and housing market conditions in Portland are improving. The unemployment rate for the region peaked at 11.1 percent in May 2009 and has since fallen to 7.3 percent as of May 2013. The foreclosure completion rate in Portland has been comparable to the national rate since April 2009, and foreclosures have been trending downward in Portland as well as nationally. The Administration's Hardest Hit Fund and Neighborhood Stabilization Programs have fueled local foreclosure prevention efforts and market stability, while nearly 35,000 households have received mortgage modifications, many directly through Administration programs. Treasury provided $220 million to Oregon to provide assistance to struggling homeowners through the Hardest Hit Fund. The number of homeowners benefitting from the program has continued to increase, with Oregon reporting more than 80 percent of program funds already committed or spent on behalf of struggling homeowners. Moreover, approximately $13.1 million has been awarded to the Portland metropolitan area through HUD's Neighborhood Stabilization Program to help purchase or redevelop residential properties and address the effects of abandoned and foreclosed housing. Both programs have helped provide increased stability to Portland and the state of Oregon. In addition, nearly 7,000 Oregon homeowners are currently benefiting from over $450 million in refinancing, short sales and completed or trial loan modifications, including principal reduction on first and second lien mortgages provided under the landmark National Mortgage Servicing Settlement. Nationwide, the settlement has provided more than $50 billion in consumer relief benefits to more than 620,000 families. That is in addition to the $2.5 billion in payments to participating states and $1.5 billion in direct payments to borrowers who were foreclosed upon between 2008 and 2011.

07/15/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-106.cfm,HUD Charges New Jersey Landlords with Refusing to Rent to African Americans,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has charged the owners of two apartment buildings in North Arlington, New Jersey, with violating the Fair Housing Act for allegedly denying rental opportunities to African Americans.
HUD's charge alleges that Michael Pontoriero, an owner of the buildings, refused to show apartments to or return the calls of a prospective tenant after learning that he is African American, and that Pontoriero repeated these and other discriminatory behaviors against African Americans in four separate tests conducted by the Fair Housing Council of Northern New Jersey (FHCNNJ).
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to refuse to rent or impose different rental terms or conditions on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, disability, or familial status.
HUD brings this charge on behalf of the prospective tenant and FHCNNJ, a non-profit fair housing organization that receives funding from HUD to investigate claims of discrimination, after both filed complaints with the Department.
According to HUD's charge, an African-American man contacted Pontoriero to inquire about an apartment he saw listed for rent. Pontoriero initially scheduled a time to show him the apartment and confirmed the appointment minutes before, but failed to appear, allegedly after learning the man is African American. Believing that Pontoriero did not show him the unit because of his race, the man contacted FHCNNJ, which conducted four paired tests using a white tester and a black tester in each test. The tests revealed that Pontoriero refused to show up for appointments and return calls after he learned that a tester was African American. Pontoriero allegedly would drive by or arrive to the appointment early in order to discover a prospective renter's race. The charge alleges further that when he did show a unit to African-American testers, he did not accompany the tester room-to-room and point out the apartment's features or provide an application as he did with white testers, and he actively discouraged black testers from applying to rent the property. In addition, he allegedly quoted a black tester a monthly rent of $100 more for a one-bedroom unit than he quoted a white tester.
""Testing is a critical tool in exposing discriminatory treatment that might otherwise go undetected,"" said Bryan Greene, HUD Acting Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD and its fair housing partners will continue to utilize trained testers to identify and end unlawful housing discrimination.""
The HUD charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages to both the individual and FHCNNJ. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief to deter further discrimination, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose fines in order to vindicate the public interest, or if the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may award punitive damages.
Persons who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed at www.hud.gov/fairhousing or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, which can be accessed through Apple devices, such as the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch."

EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take 2 months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, 4 months for total starts, and 6 months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as non-sampling error including bias and variance from response, non-reporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (3.2%) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90-percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised about three percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found on our web site listed above.
* 90% confidence interval includes zero. The Census Bureau does not have sufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero.

07/19/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-109.cfm,Donovan Announces Approval of Connecticut's Disaster Recovery Plan,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Shaun Donovan today announced HUD's approval of the State of Connecticut's disaster recovery plan to help homeowners and businesses following Hurricane Sandy. Funded through HUD's Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program, Connecticut's action plan calls for a nearly $72 million investment in a variety of housing, infrastructure and business recovery activities. Read Connecticut's disaster recovery plan (www.ct.gov/ecd/lib/ecd/housing_files/final_action_plan_for_approval.pdf).
The federal government has been on the ground since Sandy struck and will continue to provide substantial resources and technical assistance until the entire region is rebuilt safer, better and stronger. To date, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has provided $42 million in individual and public assistance in Connecticut.
Donovan, who also chairs President Obama's Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force, said today's approval will allow the State to begin the long-term process of rebuilding damaged housing, restoring infrastructure, and stimulating business activity and job growth.
""Connecticut's disaster recovery plan will bring $72 million in federal funds to help families and small businesses throughout the state recover and help fill gaps that are not covered by other federal assistance or private insurance,"" said Donovan. ""We've worked closely with Governor Malloy, Senators Blumenthal and Murphy, and the Connecticut Congressional Delegation throughout the entire process to help design effective programs that will help families get back in their homes, jumpstart local economies and make communities more resilient as quickly as possible.""
Governor Dannel P. Malloy said, ""This funding will allow us to move forward with our plan to help residents rebuild, get businesses back on their feet and make some of the investments in our infrastructure that are so clearly necessary. Connecticut has experienced more than its fair share of severe weather related events over the last two and a half years. And while we have been through a lot, we know that another storm is inevitable. As we prepare for whatever Mother Nature throws at us next, getting this funding out to communities as quickly as possible will ensure that residents can recover from Storm Sandy and we can begin to make smart investments in our towns and cities.""
""This $72 million is an excellent first step in addressing the immediate needs of those who suffered devastating damage due to Hurricane Sandy, including the many property owners and businesses who have reached out to my office for assistance,"" said Senator Richard Blumenthal. ""These funds will also be appropriately used to begin the planning for long term mitigation efforts that will better protect Connecticut residents and reduce the cost of future federal disaster relief. Storms like Hurricane Sandy are becoming the new normal, and we must immediately redouble efforts to protect the state and nation from future storm damage, and improve and streamline our federal disaster response processes to efficiently and effectively assist those in need.""
""Our HUD staff is committed to working with our Connecticut partners to begin implementing their plan"", said Barbara Fields, HUD New England Regional Administrator. ""This is the next important step in helping families and communities recover from the devastation of Hurricane Sandy.""
On January 29th, President Obama signed the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013 into law, providing a total of $16 billion in CDBG Disaster Recovery funding. HUD quickly allocated $5.4 billion to five states (including Connecticut) and New York City. Connecticut submitted its required action plan describing how the funds will be used and HUD conducted an expedited review to enable the State to access these funds as quickly as possible.
The CDBG Disaster Recovery funding gives grantees significant flexibility in determining how best to use their funds to meet the greatest unmet needs. In general, the funds are intended for the restoration of housing and infrastructure as well as economic revitalization in disaster-impacted areas. The funds are to meet recovery needs that are not otherwise covered by other federal assistance, private insurance, or other sources.
Connecticut's approach will focus principally on meeting the immediate recovery needs for housing and business assistance in the communities affected by Hurricane Sandy. These activities include $56 million to support a variety of housing programs; $4 million to assist economic revitalization programs; and $6.2 million for infrastructure and public service programs.

07/19/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-110.cfm,HUD Publishes New Proposed Rule on Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) published a new proposed rule to Affirmatively Further Fair Housing (AFFH) in the Federal Register (www.federalregister.gov/articles/2013/07/19/2013-16751/affirmatively-furthering-fair-housing) today and made available background materials and a prototype geospatial tool (www.huduser.org/portal/affht_pt.html). AFFH refers to the 1968 Fair Housing Act's obligation for state and local governments to improve and achieve more meaningful outcomes from fair housing policies, so that every American has the right to fair housing, regardless of their race, color, national origin, religion, sex, disability or familial status.
""This proposed rule represents a 21st century approach to fair housing, a step forward to ensuring that every American is able to choose to live in a community they feel proud of - where they have a fair shot at reaching their full potential in life,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""For the first time ever, HUD will provide data for every neighborhood in the country, detailing the access African American, Latino, Asian, and other communities have to local assets, including schools, jobs, transportation, and other important neighborhood resources that can play a role in helping people move into the middle class. Long-term solutions will involve various strategies, such as helping people gain access to different neighborhoods and channeling investments into underserved areas.""
The proposed rule was drafted in response to a 2010 GAO report and numerous requests from stakeholders, advocates, and HUD program participants seeking clear guidance and technical assistance. The proposed rule refines existing requirements so the individuals, organizations, and state and local governments implementing HUD programs better understand their requirements under the Fair Housing Act and have the tools they need to Affirmatively Further Fair Housing, ensuring that every American has the opportunity to live in the community of their choice without facing discrimination.
Under the proposed new rule, HUD will provide program participants with:
A more clearly articulated definition of what it means to affirmatively further fair housing; An assessment template that replaces the current, loosely defined Analysis of Impediments; Nationally uniform data and a geospatial tool; and Clear guidance and technical assistance.
• A more clearly articulated definition of what it means to affirmatively further fair housing;
• An assessment template that replaces the current, loosely defined Analysis of Impediments;
• Nationally uniform data and a geospatial tool; and
• Clear guidance and technical assistance.
As part of a larger, locally-driven assessment process with public input, the data and guidance will provide an invaluable starting point as communities work to better understand their fair housing barriers and establish clear goals. Goals developed in the assessment process will connect to investment plans at the local and state levels where communities will outline their strategies. HUD anticipates that the new AFFH rule will empower local decision-making and foster smart government and better housing policies. The new rule will also better fulfill the aims of the Fair Housing Act through this proposed AFFH process rooted in data and integrated into other planning processes.
As part of the rule making process, members of the public will have an opportunity to review the proposed AFFH rule and submit their thoughts, comments or questions via Regulations.gov. The public comment period will last for 60 days starting on Friday July 19th."

Last week, President Obama issued a disaster declaration for Mason and Roane Counties. The President's declaration allows HUD to offer foreclosure relief and other assistance to certain families living in these counties.
""Families who may have been forced from their homes need to know that help is available to begin the rebuilding process,"" said Donovan. ""Whether it's foreclosure relief for FHA-insured families or helping these counties to recover, HUD stands ready to help in any way we can.""
HUD is:
Offering the State of West Virginia the ability to re-allocate existing federal resources toward disaster relief (https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/cdbg-dr/) - HUD's Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and HOME programs give the State and communities the flexibility to redirect millions of dollars to address critical needs, including housing and services for disaster victims.

07/31/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-114.cfm,"Springfield, Mass Housing Authority Settles Lead-Based Paint Disclosure Case","BOSTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency today announced that the Springfield, Massachusetts Housing Authority will pay an $11,000 penalty for failing to inform tenants their apartments may contain lead-based paint, as required by law. In addition, the housing authority agreed to render apartment buildings at four of its properties lead safe at a cost of more than $49,500.
According to HUD and EPA, the Springfield Housing Authority violated the federal Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 (Residential Lead Act) by failing to inform people seeking to rent pre-1978 housing that their homes may contain potentially dangerous amounts of lead. This action was based on compliance inspections of the Springfield Housing Authority by EPA in 2007 and 2009.
""Today's settlement should remind landlords and property owners that they have a legal responsibility to tell their tenants about known as well as potential lead-based paint hazards in their homes,"" said Jon L. Gant, Director of HUD's Office of Healthy Homes and Lead Hazard Control. ""HUD is committed to working with public housing authorities and other housing providers to make certain we protect children from potentially dangerous exposures to lead poisoning.""
""Exposure to lead paint continues to be a significant health concern, especially for infants and children here in New England where there are many houses built before 1978 that may still contain lead paint,"" said Curt Spalding, Regional Administrator of the U.S. EPA's New England office. ""Providing basic information to prospective renters or purchasers of property built before 1978 helps to educate people about potential risks and how to protect themselves and their families from lead poisoning.""
Before the settlement, the Springfield Housing Authority performed lead-based paint inspections of its properties covered by the Residential Lead Act. Under the settlement, the Springfield Housing Authority will have two years to perform specific lead-based paint abatement work at four apartment complexes, including removal and replacement of basement windows and frames at the Ashley-Gerrish Apartments; steel exterior columns at the John J. Duggan Park Apartments; a wood basement stair system and basement walls at the Robinson Gardens Apartments; and bathtub trim at the Moxon Apartments.
The lead-based paint work is focused on these properties and building components because the lead-based paint inspections found that most of Springfield Housing Authority's other properties were lead-based paint free. Springfield Housing Authority has agreed to complete all of the required work and spend at least $49,500 in the process. The lead abatement work required by the agreements goes beyond what Springfield Housing Authority is already required to do under HUD's Lead Safe Housing Rule.
The settlement announced today is the fifth such judicial consent decree or administrative agreement in New England with HUD and EPA. Nearly 12,000 rental units have been or will be made lead safe for tenants by landlords and management companies found to have violated the Residential Lead Act. Moreover, the landlords and management companies involved in these five settlements have paid civil fines totaling $366,133 and paid over $6.5 million to eliminate or reduce lead hazards.
Background
The Residential Lead Act is one of the primary federal enforcement tools to prevent lead poisoning in young children. The Lead Disclosure Rule, authorized by the Act, requires home sellers and landlords of housing built before 1978 to provide an EPA-approved ""Protect Your Family From Lead in Your Home"" pamphlet and warn of the hazards of lead-based paint to prospective purchasers and tenants. In addition sellers and landlords must share knowledge of known lead-based paint and/or lead-based paint hazards on a disclosure form that both parties must sign. They must also provide copies of any available lead records or reports. The form should be attached to the sales contract or lease. Sellers must also provide purchasers with an opportunity to conduct a lead-based paint inspection and/or risk assessment at the purchaser's expense. Acceptable lead disclosure forms can be found at the HUD Lead Disclosure Rule web page and the EPA Lead Disclosure Rule web page (www2.epa.gov/lead/real-estate-disclosure).
Health Effects of Lead-Based Paint
Lead exposure causes reduced IQ, learning disabilities, developmental delays, poorer hearing, and a host of other health problems in young children. Many of these effects are thought to be irreversible. In later years, lead-poisoned children are much more likely to drop out of school, become juvenile delinquents and engage in criminal and other anti-social behavior. As reported in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers have found that even at low levels, lead exposure in children can significantly impact IQ and may even delay puberty in young girls.
At higher levels lead can irreversibly damage a child's kidneys and central nervous system and cause anemia, coma, convulsions and even death. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an estimated 535,000 American children have elevated blood-lead levels.
Eliminating lead-based paint hazards in pre-1978 housing is essential if childhood lead poisoning is to be eradicated. Although the prevalence of childhood lead poisoning has dropped significantly, the risk to children in low-income, older housing without government assistance remains high. HUD estimates about 23 million homes still contain significant lead-based paint hazards with the potential to poison young children."
07/31/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-116.cfm,HUD Provides Funds for Over 450 New Local Homeless Programs Across the U.S.,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Shaun Donovan today announced a third round of grants for more than 250 homeless housing and service programs across the U.S., as well as nearly 200 grants to assist with local strategic planning activities provided through HUD's Continuum of Care Program. This year, HUD challenged local communities to reexamine their response to homelessness and give greater weight to proven strategies, from providing 'rapid re-housing' for homeless families to permanent supportive housing for those experiencing chronic homelessness (see attached chart).
The $57 million in grants announced today support a wide range of new programs, including projects to create and implement systems to make the use of homeless services more efficient and more than 1,900 new permanent supportive housing beds for chronically homeless persons. The new projects were largely the result of local strategic decisions that resulted in the reallocation of funds from existing renewal projects that were no longer critically needed in favor of creating new programs to help the community achieve the goal of ending homelessness. Earlier this year, HUD awarded more than $1.5 billion in the first two rounds of grant funding to renew support for more than 7,500 local programs. View a complete list of all the state and local homeless projects awarded funding on HUD's website.
""Today's grantees will join the thousands of local programs that are on the front lines ending homelessness across the nation,"" said Donovan. ""As we continue to see a decline in homelessness, investing in programs that are moving homeless families and individuals to permanent housing is as critical as ever because it's not only the right thing to do, but it's smart government and fiscally prudent.""
Continuum of Care grants are awarded competitively to local projects to meet the needs of their homeless clients. The grants fund a wide variety of programs from street outreach and assessment to transitional and permanent housing for homeless persons and families. HUD funds are a critical part of the Obama Administration's strategic plan to prevent and end homelessness. Additionally, new grants awarded in FY2012 included—for the first time ever—$11 million in funds for planning activities that will assist Continuums of Care fulfill their responsibilities under the Continuum of Care Program interim rule.
According to the 2012 ""point in time"" estimate of the number of homeless persons in America, there were 633,782 homeless persons on a single night in January of 2012, largely unchanged from the year before. While HUD found significant declines among the long-term homeless and veterans, local communities reported an increase in the number of sheltered and unsheltered families with children.
In 2010, President Obama and 19 federal agencies and offices that form the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH) launched the nation's first comprehensive strategy to prevent and end homelessness. Opening Doors: Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness puts the country on a path to end veterans and chronic homelessness by 2015 and to ending homelessness among children, family, and youth by 2020."

08/01/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-111.cfm,HUD Approves First Stage of Rhode Island's Disaster Recovery Plan,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) New England Regional Administrator Barbara Fields today announced HUD's approval of the first stage of Rhode Island's disaster recovery plan following Hurricane Sandy. Funded through HUD's Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program, Rhode Island's initial action plan calls for a $625,612 investment in a variety of housing and infrastructure activities in Washington and Newport Counties. The full plan, when approved, will total $3.2 million. Read Rhode Island's disaster recovery plan (www.planning.ri.gov/documents/cdbg/RI_Sandy_Action_Plan_w%20Appendices.pdf).
The federal government has been on the ground since Sandy struck and will continue to provide substantial resources and technical assistance until the entire region is rebuilt safer, better and stronger. To date, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has provided $6.5 million in individual and public assistance in Rhode Island.
Fields said today's approval will allow the State to begin the long-term process of rebuilding damaged housing and restoring damaged public facilities and infrastructure.
""Homeowners and businesses in Washington and Newport Counties took a big hit from Hurricane Sandy but we're committed to help Rhode Island fill gaps that are not covered by other federal assistance or private insurance,"" said Fields. ""We've worked closely with Governor Chafee and his Administration throughout the entire process to help design effective programs that will help families repair their homes and restore damaged public facilities and infrastructure.""
""Rhode Island was fortunate that we did not sustain more damage during Hurricane Sandy, but there were several hard hit businesses and residential homes in Washington and Newport Counties,"" said Rhode Island Governor Lincoln D. Chafee. ""With this first stage of Community Development Block Grant funding, we can help residents and business owners get well on their way to repairing the damage from last fall.""
""I appreciate HUD working with the state on a plan to use these flexible recovery funds to help Rhode Island homeowners, small businesses, and communities that were hit hardest by the storm,"" said U.S. Senator Jack Reed. ""This federal funding will help Rhode Island to continue moving forward with our recovery efforts.""
""Scores of Rhode Island families and businesses were hit hard by Hurricane Sandy, and many are still struggling to recover,"" said U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, who brought members of President Obama's Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force to Rhode Island last month to tour storm-damaged areas. ""I'm glad HUD has approved the first stage of Rhode Island's disaster recovery plan, which will allow the state to access disaster funding for badly needed repairs.""
Rhode Island's CDBG-Disaster Recovery plan called on local governments and non-profit organizations, to submit proposals detailing recovery projects that will serve low- to moderate-income persons in Washington and Newport Counties (the most impacted and distressed counties as a result of Hurricane Sandy). The Rhode Island Department of Housing and Community Development (OHCD) reviewed the proposals and divided them into two groups: Tier 1, and Tier 2.
Based on the Tier 1 projects, OHCD is allocating $625,612 (19% of the total allocation) to various activities, with a heavy focus on public facilities and infrastructure. Tier 2 proposals will be approved at a later date.
On January 29th, President Obama signed the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013 into law, providing a total of $16 billion in CDBG Disaster Recovery funding. HUD quickly allocated $5.4 billion to five states (including Rhode Island) and New York City. Rhode Island submitted its first required action plan describing how the funds will be used and HUD conducted an expedited review to enable the State to access these funds as quickly as possible.
Rhode Island's initial approach will focus principally on meeting the immediate recovery needs for housing and damaged infrastructure by Hurricane Sandy. These activities include $104,000 to support a variety of housing programs; and $460,000 for infrastructure and public facilities programs. Read Rhode Island's disaster recovery plan (http://www.planning.ri.gov/documents/cdbg/RI_Sandy_Action_Plan_w%20Appendices.pdf).
The CDBG Disaster Recovery funding gives grantees significant flexibility in determining how best to use their funds to meet the greatest unmet needs. In general, the funds are intended for the restoration of housing and infrastructure as well as economic revitalization in disaster-impacted areas. The funds are to meet recovery needs that are not otherwise covered by other federal assistance, private insurance, or other sources."
08/01/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//local/md/news/pr2013-08-01.cfm,HUD Approves First Stage of Maryland's Disaster Recovery Plan,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Mid-Atlantic Regional Administrator Jane C.W. Vincent announced today HUD's approval of the first stage of Maryland's disaster recovery plan following Hurricane Sandy. Funded through HUD's Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program, Maryland's initial recovery plan calls for a $4.4 million investment in a variety of housing and infrastructure activities in Somerset County along the state's eastern shore. Read Maryland's disaster recovery plan (www.mdhousing.org/Website/About/PublicInfo/Publications/Documents/Hurricane_Sandy_Con_Plan_Amendment.pdf).
Maryland's initial CDBG-Disaster Recovery plan includes $3 million to help low- and moderate-income owner-occupants rehabilitate or replace their homes. In addition, the state plans to invest $1 million to assist small businesses that have unmet recovery needs. The full plan, when approved, will total $8.6 million.
Vincent said today's approval will allow the State to begin the long-term process of rebuilding damaged housing and restoring damaged public facilities and infrastructure.
""Homeowners and businesses in Somerset County took a big hit from Hurricane Sandy but we're committed to help Maryland fill gaps that are not covered by other federal assistance or private insurance,"" said Vincent. ""We've worked closely with Governor O'Malley and his recovery team throughout the entire process to help design effective programs that will help families repair their homes and restore damaged housing and small businesses.""
""Super-Storm Sandy was one of the most destructive storms to ever hit the United States and had a measurable impact on Marylanders, especially on the residents of Somerset County. These funds in the federal checkbook will help those still reeling from the devastation of Sandy to recover and rebuild their lives, their livelihoods and their communities,"" said Senator Barbara Mikulski, Chairwoman of the Senate Appropriations Committee that puts funds in the federal checkbook for all federal housing programs. ""I've continued to fight hard with Team Maryland so that those hit hardest by this storm know they have a federal government on their side. I've seen first-hand the impact Super-Storm Sandy has had on communities like Crisfield. We've got businesses that need to restart and homes that need to be rebuilt. This Community Development Block Grant funding is welcome relief to residents of Somerset County that will help restore infrastructure and housing and help restore lives.""
""Marylanders continue to rebuild their lives, their homes and their businesses long after Hurricane Sandy. The federal government has been a partner since day one with resources and support. The Community Development Block Grants from HUD are sorely needed and will help bridge the distance to making Crisfield and the surrounding area whole again,"" said Senator Ben Cardin. ""I will continue to work with HUD and other agencies to ensure that funds reach the people and neighborhoods most in need.""

08/01/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-119.cfm,"Gary, Indiana Enters Into Partnership Agreement with HUD to Administer Gary Housing Authority (GHA) Operations","WASHINGTON - In an effort to restore public confidence and accountability to the Gary (Indiana) Housing Authority (GHA), the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today announced a mutual agreement with the City to work together to reverse years of financial mismanagement, improve physical conditions and increase occupancy rates.
""HUD will stand with the city in addressing the shortcomings at the agency,"" said HUD Assistant Secretary Sandra B. Henriquez, who announced the receivership today. ""We respect the mayor's commitment to the city and its public housing residents to take this bold and courageous step.""
Citing a decade of neglect, Henriquez and Gary Mayor Karen Freeman-Wilson signed a Cooperative Endeavor Agreement to address administrative, financial and management concerns at the agency. HUD will lead the effort to help get GHA back on track. Freeman-Wilson noted that this move was a resident-centered decision and is expected to improve the quality of life for the residents of GHA.
""Upon a lengthy assessment of operations at GHA, we have determined that the existing problems are beyond the scope of our resources and federal assistance is required,"" said Freeman-Wilson. ""This decision was made with the residents in mind, and I am appreciative of HUD's partnership and look forward to this change resulting in the high quality of housing that Gary citizens deserve.""
In a separate letter, Freeman-Wilson acknowledged the hard work of the GHA Board of Directors and thanked them for their extraordinary efforts during her tenure.
Henriquez named two HUD employees who will assist the agency effective immediately. Willie Garrett was named executive director and Steven Meiss will serve as the one-person board of directors. Garrett is the Public Housing Director in HUD's Detroit Field Office with 15 years of housing experience in both the private and public sector. He will work directly with the housing authority staff to manage day-to-day operations to ensure residents will continue receiving services. Meiss is the Public Housing Director in HUD's Chicago Field Office and a HUD-veteran with more than 36 years of housing experience. He has also served in a board capacity for other housing agencies that are under HUD control, most recently the Detroit Housing Commission and earlier the East St. Louis (Ill.) Housing Authority.
Under the partnership agreement, HUD will first develop a detailed action plan to stabilize the housing authority's operations. The second step will be to address specific problems HUD identified in a comprehensive review of the agency's operations. The receivership period will be for at least two years. Interim GHA Executive Director Mary Cossey will remain at the agency to assist with the turnaround efforts.
This partnership with HUD will allow GHA to implement a new property management structure, modernize each of the housing developments and establish a well-defined business and operation plan, and adequate financial management systems.
""The challenges that plague the Gary Housing Authority did not occur overnight,"" said Henriquez. ""Despite HUD and the city's efforts over the years, the agency is not where it should be. This agreement is the beginning to the agency's path to recovery.""
The mayor also stated that town hall meetings for GHA residents will be held next week and will be open to the media and members of the public."
08/08/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-120.cfm,"HUD Awards $1.7 Billion to Improve, Preserve Public Housing","WASHINGTON - U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan today awarded $1.7 billion to public housing authorities in all 50 states, as well as the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, to make major large-scale improvements to the nation's 1.2 million public housing units. View funding by public housing authority here.
Today's grants are provided through HUD's Capital Fund Program, which provides funding annually to all public housing authorities to build, repair, renovate and/or modernize the public housing in their communities. The authorities use the funding to do large-scale improvements to the housing such as new roofs or to make energy-efficient upgrades to replace old plumbing and electrical systems.
""This funding is critical for housing authorities to maintain and improve public housing conditions for their residents,"" said Donovan. ""However, with a significant repair backlog, I am encouraged by new, innovative long-term solutions HUD is exploring that can be combined with this funding to not only protect and preserve this housing for the next generation, but to also build the quality infrastructure necessary for families to thrive.""
Capital Fund grants are awarded annually to the nation's approximately 3,100 public housing agencies through a formula that considers number, type and age of units in a community. Eligible uses for this funding include development, financing and modernization of the public housing units as well as management improvements at the public housing authority.
Over the past 75 years, the federal government has been working and investing billions of dollars in developing and maintaining public and multifamily housing - including providing critical support through the Capital Fund grants announced today. Still, the nation continues to lose approximately 10,000 public housing units annually, primarily due to disrepair. In 2011, HUD released Capital Needs in the Public Housing Program, a study that estimated the capital needs in the public housing stock in the U.S. The study found the nation's 1.2 million public housing units are facing an estimated $25.6 billion in large-scale repairs. Unlike routine maintenance, capital needs are extensive improvements required to make the housing decent and economically sustainable, such as replacing roofs or updating plumbing and electrical systems to increase energy efficiency.
To help protect the considerable federal investment and respond to the growing demand for affordable rental housing, the Obama Administration proposed the Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD), a comprehensive strategy that complements the Capital Fund Program and offers a long-term solution to preserve and enhance the country's affordable housing stock, including leveraging public and private funding to make critically needed improvements.
Since Congress approved the demonstration, early results show it is already generating additional capital for public and assisted housing. After opening RAD application periods last summer, HUD has approved or given initial approval to nearly 20,000 public and assisted housing units in 180 different projects across the country. Through these awards, housing authorities have proposed to generate close to $816 million in private debt and equity investments to reduce the capital backlog in public housing properties, which will preserve or replace distressed units and support local jobs in their communities - all without additional federal resources.
HUD also recently issued new RAD guidance that expands the program's flexibility that will benefit current and future applicants and participants.

08/09/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-121.cfm,Ten Design Teams Selected to Proceed to Stage Two of Rebuild By Design Competition,"WASHINGTON - Today, the Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force announced the selection of ten Design Teams to proceed to Stage Two of REBUILD BY DESIGN, a multi-stage regional design competition that will develop innovative projects to protect and enhance Sandy-affected communities. U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Shaun Donovan, who also chairs the Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force, launched the competition on June 20, 2013 in partnership with the Rockefeller Foundation.
Over 140 potential teams from more than 15 countries submitted proposals, representing the top engineering, architecture, design, landscape architecture and planning firms as well as research institutes and universities worldwide. Thanks to the generous support of the Rockefeller Foundation and JPB Foundation, as well as the New Jersey Recovery Fund and the Deutsche Bank Americas Foundation, ten Design Teams will participate in an intense eight-month process broken into two distinct stages: analysis and design.
""The ten teams we selected stood out because of the talent they bring to the table, their pioneering ideas and their commitment to innovating with a purpose and competing not just to design but to build something,"" said Secretary Donovan. ""The projects that come out of this competition will save lives and protect communities in this region and - as the Task Force will emphasize in the Rebuilding Strategy to be released in the coming weeks - serve as models as we prepare communities across the country for the impacts of a changing climate.""
""As cities around the world face increasing shocks and stresses, it is more critical than ever that we find ways to integrate resilient design into our urban future,"" said Judith Rodin, President, The Rockefeller Foundation. ""The Rebuild by Design competition is an innovative model, bringing together some of the greatest minds around the world to improve how our cities manage, cope with and bounce back stronger from disasters. I am confident that the ten extraordinary teams chosen will create innovative and replicable projects that will strengthen our cities and help them thrive in the face of climate change.""
""Hurricane Sandy brought to the fore difficult and challenging questions for the metropolitan area,"" said Robert D. Yaro, President, Regional Plan Association. ""The Rebuild by Design competition is an important and innovative process to bring design professionals and the affected communities together to deliver the best answers.""
David van der Leer, Executive Director of Van Alen Institute, said, ""By bringing together local communities with world-class, interdisciplinary design teams, we aim to produce extraordinarily innovative projects that highlight next generation perspectives and trends that will catalyze regional approaches to resilience for the United States and beyond.""
Eric Klinenberg, Research Director for Rebuild by Design's Research Stage and Director of NYU's Institute for Public Knowledge, said, ""Rebuild By Design is an unprecedented opportunity to think deeply about the great challenges for cities as the climate changes, and to act boldly, too. We look forward to learning from communities and working collaboratively with the Design Teams as we spend the next several months bringing positive action throughout the region.""
""MAS heralds the leadership of the Hurricane Sandy Task Force, and its philanthropy partners, in challenging the world's best planners and designers to work with communities and develop innovative approaches,"" said Vin Cipolla, President, Municipal Art Society of New York. ""Our priority is to strengthen the capacity of local communities across the city and region to build their environmental, economic, social and cultural resilience. RBD brings tremendous resources and expertise into the city and region.""
The selection of the teams marks the beginning of the second of four phases of the design competition, which will ultimately result in resilience projects that will be built or implemented in communities in the Sandy-impacted region:
Stage Two: Analysis
Starting today, the Design Teams will begin a three-month research and analysis process, facilitated by New York University's Institute for Public Knowledge (IPK). IPK, known for bridging the gap between serious scholarship and practical action, will present the outcome of Stage Two in a detailed report cataloguing the Design Teams' research reports and synthesizing their findings into one resource kit for local communities throughout the region.
Stage Three: Design
Building off the comprehensive analysis of the region's vulnerabilities and existing initiatives developed during Stage Two, each Design Team will then work on one site-specific design proposal. Design Teams will partner with a local or state government entity to identify specific sites and projects that will improve the resilience of communities. During this stage, the Regional Plan Association, Municipal Art Society of New York and Van Alen Institute will collaboratively facilitate this design process for the teams to develop implementable solutions for the opportunities they identified in Stage Two.
Stage Four: Implementation
The projects that come out of this innovative process will be evaluated by the Rebuild by Design jury - made up of world-renowned experts in hazard mitigation, resilience, public health, landscape architecture, urbanism, real estate, design, and other fields – to ensure that winning projects are implementable and have the maximum impact on the region's resilience.

08/09/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-122.cfm,Obama Administration Releases July Housing Scorecard,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of the Treasury today released the July edition of the Obama Administration's Housing Scorecard - a comprehensive report on the nation's housing market. The latest data show important progress across many key indicators—as home prices, purchases of new homes, and sales of existing homes continue to show strong annual gains—although officials caution that the overall recovery remains fragile.The full Housing Scorecard is available online at www.hud.gov/scorecard.
""As the July housing scorecard indicates, the Obama Administration's efforts to speed housing recovery are continuing to build upon the progress that has been made over the last four years,"" said HUD Deputy Assistant Secretary for Economic Affairs Kurt Usowski. ""The annual home price increases over the last several months remain at levels not seen since 2006 and newly initiated foreclosures are at their lowest level since December 2005. As we regain stability in our housing markets, it is time to begin the process of reforming the housing finance system to reduce the federal government footprint and ensure that private capital takes a sustainable central role.""
""The Administration's HAMP program has provided direct assistance to more than one million homeowners while creating standards that have helped millions more,"" said Treasury Assistant Secretary for Financial Stability Tim Massad. ""HAMP was designed so that assistance would go to those homeowners most in need and that the modifications provided would be sustainable. Clearly without HAMP, national foreclosure rates would have been much higher and many borrowers would not have received the assistance they needed.""
The July Housing Scorecard features key data on the health of the housing market and the impact of the Administration's foreclosure prevention programs, including:
Home prices continued to show strong annual gains as the purchases of new homes and sales of previously owned homes continued to strengthen. The FHFA purchase-only index was up 7.3 percent from one year ago and the Case-Shiller 20-city index was up 12.2 percent over the same period. Purchases of new homes in June 2013 were up 38 percent from one year ago, and are at the highest level in five years. June sales of existing homes were up 15 percent from June 2012. The Administration's foreclosure mitigation programs are providing relief for millions of homeowners as we continue to recover from an unprecedented housing crisis. More than 1.7 million homeowner assistance actions have taken place through the Making Home Affordable Program, including more than 1.2 million permanent modifications through the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP), while the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) has offered nearly 1.9 million loss mitigation and early delinquency interventions. The Administration's programs continue to encourage improved standards and processes in the industry, with HOPE Now lenders offering families and individuals more than 3.7 million proprietary mortgage modifications through May. Homeowners in HAMP continue to benefit from significant payment relief increasing their long-term likelihood of avoiding foreclosure. As of June, more than 1.2 million homeowners have received a permanent modification through HAMP, saving approximately $547 on their mortgage payments each month - a 39 percent savings from their previous payment. Quarterly re-default data shows that the performance of HAMP modifications continues to improve over time and payment relief is strongly correlated to sustainability. As a result, HAMP modifications continue to exhibit lower delinquency and re-default rates than industry modifications as reported by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.

08/15/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-123.cfm,HUD Awards $10.5 Million to Reduce Health and Safety Hazards in Housing,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today awarded nearly $10.5 million in grants designed to protect children and other vulnerable groups from health hazards in their homes. This funding highlights the link between housing and health and develops cost effective methods for mitigating residential hazards. HUD's grants are being awarded to academic and non-profit research institutions studying new methods to recognize and control residential health and safety hazards such as asthma triggers, bed bugs, mold and radon. Read a complete project-by-project summary of the programs awarded grants today.
HUD's Healthy Homes Technical Studies (HHTS) Program supports new approaches to improve the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of methods to evaluate and control housing-related health and safety hazards. The program, part of HUD's Healthy Homes Initiative, is particularly focused on the health of children and other vulnerable groups. The grants announced today supplement the $98 million in grants HUD awarded in May to protect thousands of children from lead and other home hazards.
""Our homes should be restful and safe environments for all, but too many of us suffer from preventable injury and illness due to unsafe conditions in our homes. Some of us, such as children and seniors, are more easily harmed by residential hazards, which is why it's critical that we develop cost effective methods of protecting them from hazards in the home,"" said Jon L. Gant, Director of HUD's Office of Healthy Homes and Lead Hazard Control. ""These grants will support important research that can help all of us identify and control those things in our homes that can cause or contribute to injury or illness.""
HUD's Healthy Homes Initiative promotes safe, decent, and sanitary housing as a means for preventing disease and injury. There is an emerging body of scientific evidence - to which these new grants will contribute - linking health outcomes such as asthma, lead poisoning, and unintentional injuries to substandard housing. Housing of all types and ages may contain hazards. Creating healthier housing promotes the health of people of all ages, but especially our most vulnerable, and thus has the potential to save billions annually in health care costs. Everyone needs a healthy home and some of the most serious health problems start in their home. There are special reasons to focus on the home environment:
On average we spend about 70% of our time in our homes. Children's play and interactions potentially expose them to toxins such as lead. Millions of U.S. homes have existing hazards such as deteriorated lead-based paint, elevated radon levels, or pest infestation.

08/16/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-124.cfm,"HUD, Connecticut Management Company Settle Claim Alleging Discrimination Against Families with Children","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that a national property management company will pay $15,000 under an agreement resolving allegations it discriminated against a Connecticut family with children. A Middletown, Connecticut husband and wife alleged that employees at Hamilton Point Property Management, LLC refused to renew their lease after concluding the family of five was too large for the two-bedroom apartment they occupied for nearly a decade.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to refuse to rent or to impose different rental terms on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, disability or familial status, including actions that unreasonably limit rental occupancy. The Department of Housing and Urban Development is committed to ensuring that every community has equal access to quality affordable housing that is free from discrimination. Ensuring and promoting Fair Housing practices lies at the core of HUD's mission.
HUD guidance, issued March 20, 1991, states that although an occupancy policy of two persons in a bedroom is generally reasonable under the Fair Housing Act, such a policy might in some circumstances unfairly exclude families with children and violate the Fair Housing Act. HUD's guidance states that in examining whether such policies violate the law, HUD will consider factors such as: the size of the bedrooms and of the overall unit; the age of the children; the unit configuration; other physical limitations of the housing; state and local law; and other relevant factors.
""While HUD maintains that two persons per bedroom is often a reasonable standard, we've put housing providers on notice that they must always consider the size of the rooms and overall apartment when setting occupancy standards,"" said Bryan Greene, HUD's Acting Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""We're pleased that Hamilton Point Property Management has resolved this matter in a way that will allow more families with children to live in its units.""
The family filed a complaint with HUD alleging that employees at Hamilton Point Property Management refused to renew their longstanding lease agreement because there were too many people in the family to live in their 1,464 square-foot two-bedroom apartment with a separate den/study. The company allegedly maintained an unwritten policy restricting occupancy to two persons per bedroom regardless of size, claiming that Connecticut state law required the restriction. Neither Connecticut state law nor Middletown ordinances impose a blanket restriction. The married couple's complaint further alleged that the family was forced to vacate their home under threat of eviction and had to move to another apartment that was farther away from their work and community, and which required their children to switch schools.
Under the terms of the agreement, Hamilton Point Property Management, LLC will pay $15,000 to the family and conduct a nationwide search to determine how many other families were affected by the company's occupancy policy since February 19, 2011. Qualified affected families approved by HUD may be entitled to $3500. Additionally, Hamilton Point Property Management, LLC, will revise its occupancy policy, send notice of the new policy to all current residents, and include Equal Housing Opportunity language and logos in all advertising and promotional materials."

EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take 2 months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, 4 months for total starts, and 6 months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as non-sampling error including bias and variance from response, non-reporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (3.2%) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90-percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised about three percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found on our web site listed above.
* 90% confidence interval includes zero. The Census Bureau does not have sufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero.

08/19/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-125.cfm,Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force Releases Rebuilding Strategy,"WASHINGTON - President Obama's Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force, chaired by Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Shaun Donovan, today released a rebuilding strategy to serve as a model for communities across the nation facing greater risks from extreme weather and to continue helping the Sandy-affected region rebuild. The Rebuilding Strategy contains 69 policy recommendations, many of which have already been adopted, that will help homeowners stay in and repair their homes, strengthen small businesses and revitalize local economies and ensure entire communities are better able to withstand and recover from future storms. Read more.
""I want to thank Secretary Donovan, the Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force, and the thousands of federal response and recovery personnel who have helped the region recover. We have cut red tape, piloted cutting edge programs and strengthened our partnership with state and local officials,"" President Obama said. ""While a great amount of work remains, we will stand with the region for as long as it takes to recover.""
""President Obama was clear that his Administration is committed to staying in the Sandy-impacted region until the work was done, and today marks a crucial step in that journey,"" Secretary Donovan said. ""This Rebuilding Strategy will protect families, small businesses and communities across the region, and the taxpayers' investment in them, from the risks posed by sea level rise and more extreme weather events-risks that are made worse by the reality of a changing climate.""
Among the recommendations that will have the greatest impact on Federal funding is a process to prioritize all large-scale infrastructure projects and map the connections and interdependencies between them, as well as guidelines to ensure all of those projects are built to withstand the impacts of climate change. The Strategy also explores how to harden energy infrastructure to minimize power outages and fuel shortages-and ensure continuation of cellular service-in the event of future storms.
The goal of these and other recommendations in the Strategy is to:
Align federal funding with local rebuilding visions. Cut red tape and get assistance to families, businesses, and communities efficiently and effectively, with maximum accountability. Coordinate the efforts of the Federal, State, and local governments, with a region-wide approach to rebuilding. Ensure the region is rebuilt in a way that makes it more resilient-that is, better able to withstand future storms and other risks posed by a changing climate.
• Align federal funding with local rebuilding visions.
• Cut red tape and get assistance to families, businesses, and communities efficiently and effectively, with maximum accountability.
• Coordinate the efforts of the Federal, State, and local governments, with a region-wide approach to rebuilding.
• Ensure the region is rebuilt in a way that makes it more resilient-that is, better able to withstand future storms and other risks posed by a changing climate.
In addition to the recommendations that are directly linked to Sandy Supplemental funding, the Rebuilding Strategy also includes additional policy recommendations that will have a significant impact on how the region rebuilds. Finally, in recognition of the increased risk the region and the nation face from extreme weather events, the Rebuilding Strategy includes recommendations that, if implemented, will improve our ability to withstand and recover effectively from future flood-related disasters across the country.
Several of the policies and principles developed by the Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force were also incorporated into President Obama's Climate Action Plan, which laid out a series of responsible and common sense steps to prepare communities for the impacts of a changing climate, including the need for the Federal government to make investments based on the most up to date information about future risks.
As laid out in the Rebuilding Strategy, the Task Force has also taken steps to ensure the implementation of these recommendations, each of which will be carried out by a Federal Department or Agency or an existing interagency working group. Implementation will be tracked by a team which will also build on the Task Force Program Management Office's work to track and release data on Federal spending from the Sandy supplemental funding bill.

08/21/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-127.cfm,HUD & VA Announce More Vouchers to Help Homeless Vets Get Into Permanent Homes,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) today announced the second round of HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) funding to local public housing agencies across the U.S. and Puerto Rico. The $7.8 million will provide housing and clinical services for 1,120 currently homeless veterans. In May of this year, the two agencies announced $60 million in HUD-VASH vouchers. See state/local distribution of the assistance announced today.
The supportive housing assistance announced today is provided through the HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) Program which combines rental assistance from HUD with case management and clinical services provided by VA. Since 2008, a total of 58,140 vouchers have been awarded and 43,371 formerly homeless veterans are currently in homes of their own because of HUD-VASH.
""Our nation's veterans have sacrificed and given up so much for our freedom,"" said HUD Secretary Donovan. ""These vouchers are helping America end veterans' homelessness one veteran at a time until we see not one veteran living on the street. I look forward to continue working with Secretary Shinseki and the Department of Veterans Affairs to target assistance to our homeless veterans.""
""These HUD-VASH vouchers are a vital tool in our effort to provide these brave men and women with the earned care and benefits that help them live productive, meaningful lives,"" said Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric K. Shinseki. ""So long as a single Veteran lives on our streets, we have work to do. But with the continued support of President Obama, Congress and our community partners, we will end homelessness among Veterans.""
HUD-VASH is a critical part of the Obama Administration's commitment to end Veteran and long-term chronic homelessness by 2015. Opening Doors: Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness (www.usich.gov/PDF/FactSheetVeterans.pdf) serves as a roadmap for how the federal government will work with state and local communities to confront the root causes of homelessness, especially among former servicemen and women. HUD's annual ""point in time"" estimate of the number of homeless persons and families for 2012 found that veteran homelessness fell by 7.2 percent (or 4,876 people) since January 2011 and by 17.2 percent since January 2009. On a single night in January 2012, 62,619 veterans were homeless.
The grants announced today are part of $75 million appropriated this year to support the housing needs of homeless veterans. Local public housing authorities provide rental assistance to homeless veterans while nearby VA Medical Centers (VAMC) offer supportive services and case management. This is the second round of the 2013 HUD-VASH funding. HUD expects to announce more HUD-VASH funding this year.
VAMCs work closely with homeless veterans then refer them to public housing agencies for these vouchers, based upon a variety of factors, most importantly the duration of the homelessness and the need for longer term more intensive support to obtain and maintain permanent housing. The HUD-VASH program includes both the rental assistance the voucher provides and the comprehensive case management that VAMC staff provides.
Veterans participating in the HUD-VASH program rent privately owned housing and generally contribute no more than 30 percent of their income toward rent. VA offers eligible homeless veterans clinical and supportive services through its medical centers across the U.S., Guam and Puerto Rico."

It takes 3 months to establish a trend for new houses sold. Preliminary new home sales figures are subject to revision due to the survey methodology and definitions used. The survey is primarily based on a sample of houses selected from building permits. Since a “sale” is defined as a deposit taken or sales agreement signed, this can occur prior to a permit being issued. An estimate of these prior sales is included in the sales figure. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimate of total sales is revised about 3 percent. Changes in sales price data reflect changes in the distribution of houses by region, size, etc., as well as changes in the prices of houses with identical characteristics.

08/27/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-130.cfm,HUD Announces Agreement with Michigan Apartment Complex Owners to Settle Complaints of Housing Discrimination Against Families with Children,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that the owners of Shelby Park Manor apartment complex in Shelby Township, MI, will pay $100,000 as part of an agreement resolving allegations that the property's on-site manager refused to rent to families with children.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to discriminate in the sale or rental of housing based on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, disability, or familial status.
""For 25 years, federal law has made it illegal to deny housing to families simply because they have children. Likewise, the Fair Housing Act sets forth the standards '55 and over' communities must meet if they are to exclude families with children,"" said Bryan Greene, HUD's Acting Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will continue to educate the public, seek voluntary compliance, and enforce these provisions of law.""
The case came to HUD's attention when the Fair Housing Center of Metropolitan Detroit (FHCMD), a non-profit fair housing organization that receives HUD funding, filed a complaint with HUD alleging that testing they conducted revealed that Shelby Park Manor's property manager refused to rent to families with children.
The complaint followed a series of fair housing tests conducted by FHCMD. In several of the tests, Shelby Park Manor's property manager allegedly told testers that the complex was a community for persons 55 years of age and older and that she could not accommodate persons with children.
Under the terms of the agreement, Shelby Park Manor will pay $100,000 to FHCMD, develop and implement new policies, standards and procedures that do not discriminate against prospective tenants because of their family status or race, meet the requirements of the Housing for Older Persons Act if claiming to be senior housing, and provide fair housing training for its property manager."

08/28/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-132.cfm,Agencies Request Comment on Proposed Risk Retention Rule,"Six federal agencies on Wednesday issued a notice revising a proposed rule requiring sponsors of securitization transactions to retain risk in those transactions. The new proposal revises a proposed rule the agencies issued in 2011 to implement the risk retention requirement in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act).
This proposal is being issued jointly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Securities and Exchange Commission. As provided under the statute, the Secretary of the Treasury, as Chairperson of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, played a coordinating role in the rulemaking. The rule would provide asset-backed securities (ABS) sponsors with several options to satisfy the risk retention requirements. The original proposal generally measured compliance with the risk retention requirements based on the par value of securities issued in a securitization transaction and included a so-called premium capture provision. The agencies are now proposing that risk retention generally be based on fair value measurements without a premium capture provision.
As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the proposal would define ""qualified residential mortgage"" (QRM) and exempt securitizations of QRMs from risk retention. The new proposal would define QRMs to have the same meaning as the term qualified mortgages as defined by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The new proposal also requests comment on an alternative definition of QRM that would include certain underwriting standards in addition to the qualified mortgage criteria.
Similar to the original proposal, under the new proposal, securitizations of commercial loans, commercial mortgages, or automobile loans of low credit risk would not be subject to risk retention. Further, the rule would recognize the full guarantee on payments of principal and interest provided by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for their residential mortgage-backed securities as meeting the risk retention requirements while Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are in conservatorship or receivership and have capital support from the U.S. government. This provision also is unchanged from the original proposal.
The agencies are requesting comment on the revised proposed rule by October 30, 2013."
08/29/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-133.cfm,"HUD Awards $13 Million in ""Sweat Equity"" Grants","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today awarded $12.8 million in ""sweat equity"" grants to four non-profit self-help housing organizations which will create at least 718 affordable homes for working families. Funded through HUD's Self-Help Homeownership Opportunity Program (SHOP), the funding awarded today, along with the labor contributed by the homebuyers and numerous volunteers, will significantly lower the cost of homeownership.
""Today, we make another investment in the American Dream for hundreds of working families,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""Using their own labor, along with sweat equity from armies of volunteers, these families will construct their own homes and become stakeholders in their own neighborhoods.""
The following organizations will receive SHOP funds (see complete descriptions below):
HUD's SHOP program provides federal grants on a competitive basis to national and regional non-profit organizations and consortia that have experience in administering self-help homeownership housing programs. The SHOP grants must be used to purchase land and make necessary infrastructure improvements, which together may not exceed an average SHOP investment of $15,000 per dwelling unit. Leveraged funds must be used for the construction or rehabilitation of these homeownership units.
All newly constructed units will receive certification as ENERGY STAR-qualified units. All appliances, products or features that are installed or replaced will be ENERGY STAR qualified. Water usage products will bear the WaterSense label. Many units will also have ""Green,"" ""Healthy Homes,"" and ""Universal Design"" features.
Homebuyers will contribute significant sweat equity towards the development of their units and/or the units of other homebuyers participating in the local self-help housing programs. These sweat equity contributions reduce the purchase price of the SHOP units and make these units affordable for low-income homebuyers. A minimum of 100 sweat equity hours is required from a household of two or more persons. A minimum of 50 sweat equity hours is required from a household of one person. Community participation consisting of volunteer labor contributions is also required. Sweat equity and volunteer labor may include, but are not limited to, landscaping, foundation work, painting, carpentry, trim work, drywall, roofing and siding for the housing. Reasonable accommodations must be made for persons with disabilities.
Grantees may carry out activities directly and/or distribute SHOP funds to local non-profit affiliates that will develop the SHOP units, select homebuyers, coordinate the homebuyer sweat equity and volunteer efforts, and assist in the arrangement of interim and permanent financing for the homebuyers. The Grantees ensure that the new homebuyers can afford their homes at the time of purchase and for the long term. Many of the SHOP homebuyers are first time homeowners and come from underserved groups.
Since 1996, when Congress first appropriated SHOP funds, the SHOP program has provided more than $386 million in federal grants that, together with significant leveraged funds and numerous volunteer hours, are transforming lives and neighborhoods through the production of over 28,000 units of affordable, homeownership housing."
08/30/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-134.cfm,HUD Provides Nearly $37 Million to Help Oklahomans Recover from Powerful Tornadoes,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Shaun Donovan today announced nearly $37 million in disaster recovery aid to the City of Moore and to the State of Oklahoma to help local communities recover from a devastating spate of storms, including a powerful tornado that struck Moore on May 20th. These grants are provided through HUD's Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program to support long-term disaster recovery efforts in areas with the greatest extent of 'unmet need.'
The City of Moore will receive $26.3 million to supplement other forms of public and private disaster aid following May's powerful EF5 tornado with its winds exceeding 200 miles per hour. In addition, the State of Oklahoma will receive $10.6 million to support local recovery efforts following these powerful storms that occurred from May 18th through June 2nd.
""These powerful tornadoes laid waste to a number of Oklahoma communities, destroying homes, businesses and critical infrastructure beyond the limits of private insurance and other forms of public assistance,"" said Donovan. ""HUD is continuing to work closely with state and local partners to help them meet these remaining needs and promote locally driven recovery strategies.""
Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin added, ""The May storms cost the lives of dozens of Oklahomans and over $1 billion in property damage. We are steadily rebuilding, but many families are still struggling to get back on their feet. The disaster relief grants provided by HUD – along with continued work from state and local governments and non-profits – will make a big difference in the lives of those affected by this year's tornadoes. They will be particularly helpful as we work to provide assistance to low income Oklahomans, many of whom are uninsured.""
Rep. Tom Cole said, ""Today's HUD announcement of additional relief funding is one that brings hope to thousands of Oklahomans whose homes and businesses were destroyed by the horrific tornadoes in May. I am pleased by the generous grant provided by HUD to help our state and my hometown of Moore restore lost homes and businesses and repair broken infrastructure. Because of the committed work of Secretary Shaun Donovan and numerous groups and individuals across the country, disaster recovery in Oklahoma continues to look better each day.""
The Disaster Relief Appropriations Act of 2013, signed into law by President Obama on January 29th, included $16 billion in CDBG-Disaster Recovery funding. Eight days later, HUD announced a first round of aid totaling $5.4 billion to five states and the City of New York impacted by Hurricane Sandy. Last March, HUD allocated a second round of assistance totaling $514 million to a number of state and local governments to recover from disasters that occurred in 2011 and 2012. The Department will announce additional allocations throughout the year based upon the level of remaining needs to help other states and local communities impacted by natural disasters in 2011 through 2013.
HUD's CDBG-Disaster Recovery grants are intended to confront housing, business and infrastructure needs beyond those addressed by other forms of public and private assistance. Using a combination of data from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Small Business Administration (SBA), HUD identified those states and local requiring the greatest assistance to recover from devastating tornadoes, tropical storms, hurricanes, flood events and destructive wildfires in 2011, 2012, and 2013.
HUD is required to use the best available disaster data in order to determine the relative level of 'unmet needs' in areas impacted by presidentially declared disasters that occurred in 2011, 2012 and 2013. As more disaster data becomes available, HUD will make additional CDBG-Disaster Recovery allocations to these impacted areas to assist in their long-term recovery activities, if deemed necessary. HUD will shortly publish a Notice that will regulate the use of the funds announced today. State and local grantees will then finalize disaster 'action plans' describing how they intend to expend these funds to support disaster recovery and HUD will quickly review them."

These grants are provided through HUD's Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program to support long-term disaster recovery efforts in areas with the greatest extent of 'unmet need.'
The City of Chicago will receive $4.3 million; Cook County will receive $13.9 million; DuPage County will receive $7 million; and the State of Illinois will receive $3.6 million to support local recovery efforts following powerful storms and flooding that occurred from April 16th through May 5th.
""Last Spring's storms caused tremendous damage to homes and businesses throughout the Chicago area, creating needs that stretched beyond the limits of private insurance and other forms of public assistance,"" said Donovan. ""HUD is continuing to work closely with state and local partners to help them meet these remaining needs and promote locally driven recovery strategies.""
""The CDBG program is an important tool for helping local governments tackle serious challenges facing their communities,"" U.S. Senator Dick Durbin said. ""While the storm damage and floodwaters may not be around anymore, their impact remains. This funding will help make the county's cities and local governments whole again while allowing them to better prepare for future storms.""
""This federal aid is good news for many communities across Illinois that were hit hard by the historic flooding this spring,"" Governor Quinn said. ""Thousands of Illinois residents have been significantly impacted by this natural disaster and this critical assistance will help our communities as they work to rebuild and recover. I thank President Obama and HUD Secretary Donovan for their swift response to aid our state.""
""These funds that Chicago will receive from HUD will strengthen the ongoing flood recovery efforts in throughout the city,"" said Mayor Rahm Emanuel. ""It is critical that we support the communities affected by the floods as they rebuild and recover from the damage done this past Spring, and these resources will help bring economic stability to our neighborhoods, businesses, and homes.""
""These HUD funds are vital to Illinois communities as they continue to recover from the damaging storms that pounded the state in April and May,"" said Antonio R. Riley, HUD's Midwest Regional Administrator.

09/11/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-137.cfm,HUD Awards $25 Million to Help Local Communities Tackle Homelessness and Carry Out 'Place-Based' Development,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today awarded $25.3 million in technical assistance to 11 organizations that will, in turn, help local communities across this country better understand their homeless challenge and successfully carry out comprehensive and sustainable ""place-based"" development and revitalization strategies.
The funding announced today is provided through two HUD programs - OneCPD Plus: Technical Assistance and Capacity Building under the Transformation Initiative (OneCPD+) and the McKinney-Vento HMIS Technical Assistance and Research (HMIS-TA). The purpose of these grants is to provide the highest level of performance among HUD grantees and to improve data collection and reporting by local homeless assistance planning organizations called ""Continuums of Care.""
""These grants provide much needed assistance in helping to determine how we can better help the homeless,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""Teams of experts will travel the country to help local communities serve their homeless populations, develop innovated housing and community development programs, and generally improve the effectiveness of their current programs.""
HUD's Office of Community Planning and Development's new OneCPD Integrated Practitioner Assistance System represents a fundamental change in the way HUD's traditional program-specific technical assistance has been structured and delivered over the years. This approach is intended to build the kind of grantee management systems and capacity necessary to successfully carry out comprehensive and sustainable place-based development and revitalization strategies.
HUD is awarding $18.7 million to fund OneCPD+ offering technical assistance and capacity building in a number of community development, affordable housing and special needs aspects. OneCPD+ funding will also improve the overall performance of a public housing agency by addressing deficiencies in the financial management and administration of HUD-funded programs (including but not limited to public housing, housing choice vouchers, and mixed finance development), providing repositioning options, and providing capacity building for PHA staff and boards (see funding chart below).
In addition, the Department is awarding $6.6 million for technical assistance and research for Homeless Management Information System (HMIS) data collection, reporting, data utilization, performance measurement and research (see funding chart below).
OneCPD allows grantees to tell their story of accomplishment by measuring not only the outputs of this technical and capacity building assistance but the outcomes and the impact on their communities as well. The technical and capacity building assistance awards announced today are provided through the Department's Office of Community Planning and Development (CPD)."
09/12/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-138.cfm,HUD Charges West Virginia Mobile Home Park Owners with Discrimination for Denying Assistance Animal to Resident,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is charging the owners of Whitacre's Mobile Home Community (WMHC) in Inwood, West Virginia with discriminating against a resident with a disability by refusing to grant his request to keep his emotional support animal. HUD's charge alleges that WMHC ignored the resident's multiple requests for a reasonable accommodation and attempted to evict him.
The Fair Housing Act requires housing providers to make reasonable accommodations in their rules, policies, practices or services when needed to provide persons with disabilities an equal opportunity to use or enjoy a dwelling.
""Assistance animals provide persons with disabilities the stability they need to function on a daily basis,"" stated Bryan Greene, HUD's Acting Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will continue to enforce the Fair Housing Act's protections to ensure that housing providers comply with their obligation to provide reasonable accommodations.""
According to HUD's charge, a resident in the mobile home community who has difficulty sleeping and experiences severe anxiety as a result of a 2009 home invasion asked WHMC to waive its ""no pets"" policy and allow him to keep an emotional support dog that assists with coping with his disability. Although the resident submitted a doctor's note attesting to his need for the animal, WHMC declined his requests and attempted to evict him.
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages to aggrieved persons for the harm caused them by the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief to deter further discrimination, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose fines in order to vindicate the public interest. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages.
Persons who believe they have been denied a reasonable accommodation request may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to www.hud.gov/fairhousing, or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, which can be accessed through Apple devices, such as the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch."
09/13/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-139.cfm,Obama Administration Releases August Housing Scorecard,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of the Treasury today released the August edition of the Obama Administration's Housing Scorecard - a comprehensive report on the nation's housing market. The latest data show important progress across many key indicators—as home prices, purchases of new homes, and sales of existing homes continue to show strong annual gains—although officials caution that the overall recovery remains fragile. The full Housing Scorecard is available online at www.hud.gov/scorecard.
""As indicated in the August housing scorecard, the Administration continues to work to stabilize the housing market and help responsible homeowners get back on their feet,"" said HUD Deputy Assistant Secretary for Economic Affairs Kurt Usowski. ""With the number of underwater homeowners decreasing by more than 40%, it is clear that we are moving in the right direction. As we regain stability in our housing markets, it is important to remember that we still have a long way to go in making sure that our housing finance system is strong for future generations.""
""The standards set by the Making Home Affordable Program have changed the mortgage servicing industry, as have our quarterly assessments of servicer performance,"" said Treasury Assistant Secretary for Financial Stability Tim Massad. ""While there has been significant progress, there is still more improvement needed in servicer behavior. And while the housing market has recovered substantially, there are still homeowners struggling to avoid foreclosure and it is vital that we continue to try to help them.""
Since inception of the Making Home Affordable Program, Treasury has required participating servicers to take specific actions to improve their processes through ongoing program reviews. The quarterly Servicer Assessments summarize performance in three categories of program implementation: identifying and contacting homeowners; homeowner evaluation and assistance; and program reporting, management and governance. Results for the second quarter of 2013 show that, although servicer performance can fluctuate from quarter to quarter, in general, servicers are demonstrating sustained performance in program implementation. While servicer's execution of MHA has improved over time, there are still areas where servicer performance requires improvement, and Treasury will continue to apply pressure on the mortgage servicing industry to sustain these improvements.
Mortgage servicers continue to appropriately calculate homeowner income, which is used to determine a homeowner's eligibility and modified payment amount under the program. In Q2 2013, the majority of servicers have income calculation error rates below the benchmark established by Treasury (with two servicers at zero percent error rates). Servicers continue to effectively evaluate homeowners under program eligibility criteria as evidenced in the ""second look disagree"" category, which reflects the rate at which Treasury's program reviews disagree with the servicer's decision not to assist a homeowner. In Q2 2013, the average second look disagree percentage for the top servicers was less than 2 percent, less than half of Treasury's established benchmark.

All servicers will need to continue to demonstrate progress in any areas identified in subsequent program reviews. Servicers have been directed to enhance their execution in key areas that include timely solicitation of homeowners for participation in MHA; timely, accurate and detailed communications with homeowners; and ensuring the integrity and proper use of the Net Present Value (NPV) model during the evaluation process.
The August Housing Scorecard features key data on the health of the housing market and the impact of the Administration's foreclosure prevention programs, including:
Home prices continued to show strong annual gains. As of June 2013, the FHFA purchase-only index rose 7.7 percent from last year, and was up on a seasonally adjusted basis by 0.7 percent from May. The FHFA seasonally adjusted purchase-only index for the U.S. has increased for the last 17 consecutive months. The S&P/Case-Shiller 20-City Home Price Index posted returns of 2.2% for June (not seasonally adjusted) and 12.1% over the past 12 months. Millions of underwater homeowners are getting relief due to improvements in home prices. The number of underwater homeowners has fallen by 42% since the beginning of 2012 - from 12.1 million to 7.1 million as of the second quarter of 2013 - lifting 5.0 million homeowners who owed more on their mortgages than they were worth above water. In the first half of 2013, nearly 3.5 million homeowners have returned to positive equity. CoreLogic credits the decrease in underwater borrowers largely to the improvement in home prices. The Administration's foreclosure mitigation programs continue to provide relief for millions of homeowners as the recovery from the housing crisis continues. Over 1.7 million homeowner assistance actions have taken place through the Making Home Affordable Program, including more than 1.2 million permanent modifications through the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP), while the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) has offered more than 1.9 million loss mitigation and early delinquency interventions. The Administration's programs continue to encourage improved standards and processes in the industry, with HOPE Now lenders offering families and individuals more than 3.7 million proprietary modifications through June. The Neighborhood Stabilization Program continues to help communities across all 50 states to address foreclosed and abandoned homes. During the Second Quarter of 2013, grantees report cumulative completions of newly constructed or rehabilitated housing units under NSP topping 25,000 units, while direct assistance to homeowners reached the 10,000 mark, signaling strong progress toward achieving projected activity under the NSP1, NSP2, and NSP3 programs. Homeowners in HAMP continue to benefit from meaningful payment relief, increasing their long-term likelihood of avoiding foreclosure. As of July, more than 1.2 million homeowners have received a permanent modification through HAMP, saving approximately $547 on their mortgage payments each month—a 39 percent savings from their previous payment—saving a total estimated $21.6 billion in monthly mortgage payments. In July, 73 percent of eligible non-GSE mortgages benefitted from principal reduction with their HAMP modification. Homeowners currently in HAMP permanent modifications with some form of principal reduction have been granted an estimated $11.1 billion in principal reduction.

09/13/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-141.cfm,"HUD Awards $500,000 to Preserve Historic YMCA in Selma, Alabama","WASHINGTON - For generations, the historic YMCA building in Selma, Alabama was a central feature in the city's social life and business district. Over the years, however, the historic structure fell into neglect and was in danger of collapse. Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) awarded Selma a $500,000 grant to help the City and preservationists bring the structure back to useful life.
HUD's HOPE VI Main Street Program seeks to rejuvenate older, downtown business districts while retaining the area's traditional and historic character. Grant funding helps smaller communities in the development of affordable housing that is undertaken in connection with a Main Street revitalization effort. Obsolete commercial offices or buildings can be reconfigured into rent producing affordable housing.
""Today, we make an investment to help preserve the historic character of downtown Selma while expanding affordable housing and business opportunities,"" said Ed Jennings, HUD's Southeast Regional Administrator. ""Our nation's main streets are especially important to our smaller communities and I'm extremely proud we can work with Selma and local preservationists to breathe new life into the old YMCA building.""
Rep. Terri Sewell added, ""I'm delighted that the City of Selma has received a $500,000 grant from HUD to revitalize its historic YMCA building. The YMCA building is the oldest YMCA building still standing in the state of Alabama and adds to the city's rich cultural history. This grant will help ensure that the YMCA remains a valuable community asset to the 7th Congressional District.""
Built around 1887, Selma's YMCA building is located at 217 Broad Street and was one of the first YMCAs in Alabama. After the YMCA outgrew that location, the building was used for commercial purposes until eventually it became vacant and neglected. A leaking roof led to the collapse of the interior floors, putting the exterior walls in danger of collapse. Due to the architectural and cultural significance of the building, Selma Dallas County Historic Preservation Society purchased the building and committed to save it. Structural engineers stabilized the building with a new roof and rebuilt floors in newly reinforced walls. The facade of the building was not changed.
Most of the street level will be retained primarily as future retail or office space. A one-bedroom unit for a person living with disabilities will occupy the remainder of the first floor. The second level will be developed into two two-bedroom units and three one-bedroom units, yielding a total of six newly constructed housing units. The building has a third level, but no plans have been made for it at this time.
The 10-block long Main Street area includes several buildings built in the 1800's. The YMCA building that is designated as the Main Street project is three blocks from the Edmund Pettus Bridge, known for the ""Bloody Sunday"" attack on civil rights demonstrators, which was pivotal in the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Visitors can trace the history of the National Voting Rights Movement in the recently restored 1870 Italianate Selma Interpretive Center for the Selma to Montgomery Historic Trail. The Interpretive Center is between the bridge and the YMCA building."
09/16/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-140.cfm,"HUD, New Jersey Apartment Owners Settle Claim Alleging Discrimination Against African Americans","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that the owners of two apartment buildings in North Arlington, NJ, will pay $21,000 under an Initial Decision and Consent Order resolving allegations that the owners violated the Fair Housing Act by denying rental opportunities to prospective African-American tenants.
Earlier this year, HUD charged Michael Pontoriero, one of the buildings' owners, with violating the Fair Housing Act for refusing to show apartments to or return the calls of a prospective tenant after learning that he is African American. The charge further alleged that Pontoriero repeated the discriminatory behaviors in fair housing tests that were conducted by the Fair Housing Council of Northern New Jersey (FHCNNJ), a non-profit fair housing organization that receives funding from HUD to investigate claims of discrimination.
""Fair housing testing-where people of different backgrounds pose as applicants for housing-remains our most effective tool for exposing illegal housing discrimination that still too often occurs in this country,"" stated Bryan Greene, HUD's Acting Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will continue to take enforcement action against individuals and housing providers who violate the Fair Housing Act.""
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to refuse to rent or impose different rental terms or conditions on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, disability, or familial status.
The settlement HUD announces today stems from a charge HUD filed in June 2013 on behalf of an African-American man and FHCNNJ. HUD's charge alleged that the man, when searching for housing, contacted Pontoriero to inquire about an apartment for rent. According to the charge, Pontoriero made an appointment to show the man the apartment, confirmed the appointment minutes before, and then failed to keep the appointment after learning the man's race. Believing that he had been the victim of illegal discrimination, the man contacted FHCNNJ, which conducted four paired tests using a white tester and a black tester in each test.
The charge alleged that the tests revealed that Pontoriero refused to show up for appointments and return calls after he learned that a tester was African American. Pontoriero allegedly would drive by or arrive for apartment viewing appointments early in order to discover a prospective renter's race.
Under the terms of the Initial Decision and Consent Order, the apartment owners will pay $10,000 to the African-American man and $5,000 to the Fair Housing Council of Northern New Jersey for damages arising out of the alleged discrimination. The owners must also pay a $6,000 civil penalty. Additionally, the owners and their employees must complete fair housing training and implement a non-discrimination policy.
Persons who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed at www.hud.gov/fairhousing or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, which can be accessed through Apple devices, such as the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch."

EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take 2 months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, 4 months for total starts, and 6 months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as non-sampling error including bias and variance from response, non-reporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (3.2%) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90-percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised about three percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found on our web site listed above.
* 90% confidence interval includes zero. The Census Bureau does not have sufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero.

09/26/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-147b.cfm,Secretary Donovan Announces Additional Step to Protect Sandy-Impacted Homeowners,"WASHINGTON - The Federal Housing Administration and the Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force today announced the sale of $180 million in defaulted loans in the Sandy-impacted region to a Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI), which plans to work with homeowners to restructure their loans to help them remain in their homes. The CDFI - New Jersey Community Capital (NJCC) - is launching a program called ""Restart the Shore"" to assist approximately 600 homeowners at all stages of the foreclosure process in the nine most impacted counties in New Jersey. The sale also represents implementation of a recommendation in the Task Force's Rebuilding Strategy, which included a number of steps to protect homeowners in the impacted region.
""This Administration has taken a series of steps to protect homeowners who, through no fault of their own, face foreclosure as a result of Sandy,"" said Secretary Donovan. ""This sale will give families a desperately needed fresh start - a chance to stay in their homes, take steps to protect themselves from future storms and remain in the communities many have lived in for decades.""
In the days after Sandy, Secretary Donovan joined Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) Director Ed DeMarco in announcing a 30-day foreclosure moratorium for all federally backed loans in the Sandy-impacted region. That moratorium was extended through April 30. In addition, FHA and FHFA announced a forbearance process for those loans that included streamlined loan modifications to protect homeowners from massive lump sum payments when the moratorium expired.
By partnering with local HUD-approved counseling agencies, modifying homeowners' loans to make them more affordable and permitting as many as possible to remain in their homes, NJCC is contributing to the stability of entire communities impacted by Sandy, and its arrival on the heels of an already devastating recession. They will also work with homeowners to assess flood risks and help them take steps to mitigate against such risk.
The Restart program will ultimately impact hundreds of properties at a time in a given community, helping to revitalize entire neighborhoods. It will also create strong partnerships with regional institutions to help provide additional financial and other resources to communities - a key goal outlined in the Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Strategy released by the Task Force in August."
09/27/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-146.cfm,HUD & VA Announce More Vouchers to Help Homeless Vets Get Into Permanent Homes,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) today announced a third round of HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) funding to local public housing agencies across the U.S. The funding will offer permanent homes and clinical services to 110 homeless veterans (see attached chart).
Earlier this year, the two agencies announced $68 million in HUD-VASH vouchers to help house and serve approximately 10,000 veterans, most unsheltered or living in homeless shelters. The supportive housing assistance announced today is provided through the HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) Program which combines rental assistance from HUD with case management and clinical services provided by VA. Since 2008, a total of 58,250 vouchers have been awarded and 43,371 formerly homeless veterans are currently in homes of their own because of HUD-VASH.
""Our nation's veterans have sacrificed and given up so much for our freedom so it is our responsibility to do whatever we can to make sure they are taken care of,"" said HUD Secretary Donovan. ""These vouchers are vital to helping America end veterans' homelessness one veteran at a time. I look forward to continue working with Secretary Shinseki and the Department of Veterans Affairs to target assistance to our homeless veterans.""
""These HUD-VASH vouchers are a vital tool in our effort to provide these brave men and women with the earned care and benefits that help them live productive, meaningful lives,"" said Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric K. Shinseki. ""So long as a single Veteran lives on our streets, we have work to do. But with the continued support of President Obama, Congress and our community partners, we will end homelessness among Veterans.""
HUD-VASH is a critical part of the Obama Administration's commitment to end Veteran and long-term chronic homelessness by 2015. Opening Doors: Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness (www.usich.gov/PDF/FactSheetVeterans.pdf) serves as a roadmap for how the federal government will work with state and local communities to confront the root causes of homelessness, especially among former servicemen and women. HUD's annual ""point in time"" estimate of the number of homeless persons and families for 2012 found that veteran homelessness fell by 7.2 percent (or 4,876 people) since January 2011 and by 17.2 percent since January 2009. On a single night in January 2012, 62,619 veterans were homeless.
The grants announced today are part of $75 million appropriated this year to support the housing needs of homeless veterans. Local public housing authorities provide rental assistance to homeless veterans while nearby VA Medical Centers (VAMC) offer supportive services and case management.
VAMCs work closely with homeless veterans then refer them to public housing agencies for these vouchers, based upon a variety of factors, most importantly the duration of the homelessness and the need for longer term more intensive support to obtain and maintain permanent housing. The HUD-VASH program includes both the rental assistance the voucher provides and the comprehensive case management that VAMC staff provides.
Veterans participating in the HUD-VASH program rent privately owned housing and generally contribute no more than 30 percent of their income toward rent. VA offers eligible homeless veterans clinical and supportive services through its medical centers across the U.S., Guam and Puerto Rico."
09/27/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-148.cfm,HUD Charges Owner of Minnesota Apartments with Discriminating Against Disabled Prospective Resident,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is charging a St. Cloud, MN, apartment owner with violating the Fair Housing Act for allegedly citing a ""no pets"" policy after learning that a prospective resident with disabilities required an emotional support animal.
The Fair Housing Act requires housing providers to make reasonable accommodations in their rules, policies, practices or services when needed to provide persons with disabilities an equal opportunity to use or enjoy a dwelling.
""Support animals can be essential to persons with physical, mental, or emotional disabilities,"" said Bryan Greene, Acting Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Housing Providers must make exceptions to 'no-pets' policies if a person with a disability requires an animal to fulfill a major life activity.""
The charge resulted from a complaint filed with HUD by a woman who visited the apartments in St. Cloud and inquired with its owner, Kurt Schimnich, about renting one of the apartments. Schimnich allegedly refused to show an available apartment to the woman upon seeing her dog, citing a ""no pets"" policy. According to HUD's charge, the woman explained that she was disabled and the dog was a support animal. Schimnich still refused to show the apartment.
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages to the complainant. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief to deter further discrimination, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose fines in order to vindicate the public interest. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages.
Persons who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY).

09/30/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-149.cfm,"Mortgage Insurance Company Pays $30,000 to Settle Maternity Leave Discrimination Claims","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has reached agreements to settle two Fair Housing Act complaints against Madison, WI-based CMG Mortgage Insurance Company (CMG MI), the nation's largest provider of private mortgage insurance to credit unions. CMG MI will pay $30,000, resolving allegations that it refused to insure the home mortgage loan of a married couple because the wife was on maternity leave, and that it maintained a written policy of refusing to consider the regular pay of women on maternity leave as income.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to discriminate in mortgage lending and residential real estate-related transactions based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, family status or disability. These prohibitions include refusing to approve a mortgage loan or to provide mortgage insurance because a woman is pregnant or on maternity leave.
""A woman's maternity leave is not a legitimate basis for a lender to deny a mortgage loan or for an insurer to deny mortgage insurance,"" said Bryan Greene, HUD Acting Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""This settlement will allow families all over the country to obtain home loans without respect to their family leave status.""
The Conciliation Agreements resulted from a complaint by a married couple seeking to refinance their home mortgage loan through a credit union. The credit union allegedly denied the application because the woman was on maternity leave, citing CMG MI's guidelines for calculating income for women on maternity leave, which allowed for regular pay to be considered only if the applicant returned to work before the loan closed.
HUD also filed a Secretary-initiated complaint against CMG MI on behalf of the public, alleging that the company's written policies and procedures regarding borrowers on maternity, paternity, pregnancy, or parental leave were discriminatory.
Under the terms of the Conciliation Agreements, CMG MI will pay $5,000 to the couple who filed the initial complaint and $25,000 to a qualified organization to educate the public about their fair lending rights, including the rights of borrowers on maternity, paternity, pregnancy, or parental leave when applying for home mortgage loans. Additionally, CMG MI will develop new nondiscriminatory guidelines regarding calculating maternity, paternity, and pregnancy leave income, and train its employees and employees of credit unions that have underwriting responsibilities about these new guidelines.
Persons who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY).

FHA expects all approved mortgagees and lenders to make every effort to communicate with and assist affected borrowers to the greatest extent possible by:
extending informal forbearance plans to borrowers facing financial hardship as a result of the shutdown, and fully evaluating borrowers for available loss mitigation options to avoid foreclosure whenever possible.
• extending informal forbearance plans to borrowers facing financial hardship as a result of the shutdown, and
• fully evaluating borrowers for available loss mitigation options to avoid foreclosure whenever possible.
""These dedicated public servants, through no fault of their own, are now forced to find a way to meet their ongoing financial obligations without their usual salaries,"" said FHA Commissioner Carol Galante in a letter to FHA-approved lenders and mortgagees. ""In many instances these are the same employees who have already lost pay during recent sequestration related furloughs.""
FHA is also strongly encouraging all approved mortgagees and lenders to waive late fees for affected borrowers and to suspend credit reporting on borrowers nationwide who have been affected by the shutdown.
""FHA is working to ensure that the hard won improvement in the housing market is not substantially compromised by the government shutdown and, in particular, that responsible FHA borrowers impacted by the shut-down receive the support they need,"" Galante added.
FHA joins Fannie Mae (https://www.fanniemae.com/content/announcement/ll1308.pdf), Freddie Mac (www.freddiemac.com/singlefamily/guide/bulletins/pdf/bll1319.pdf) and the Veterans' Administration (www.benefits.va.gov/homeloans/documents/circulars/26_13_23.pdf) in urging lenders to take action to protect those federal workers impacted by the shutdown.

The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination based on disability and requires housing providers, including homeowners associations, to make reasonable accommodations in their rules, policies, practices or services when needed to provide persons with disabilities an equal opportunity to use or enjoy a dwelling.
""Homeowners associations must grant reasonable accommodations that enable residents to meet the needs of family members with disabilities,"" said Bryan Greene, HUD's Acting Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Homeowners associations have the same responsibility as housing providers to follow fair housing laws.""
The family filed a complaint with HUD alleging that, after it purchased an ambulance to transport its son to and from medical appointments, the homeowners association refused to permit the family to park the ambulance in the family's driveway. The son's disability makes it necessary to transport him in a prone position. The family alleged that, despite providing the homeowners association with a letter documenting the family's need for the ambulance, the association and its property management company refused the family's requests, citing association rules that do not allow residents to park commercial vehicles on their properties.
Under the terms of the conciliation agreement, Harbor Cove Homeowners Association, First Columbia Community Management, Inc., and HAE Investments, LTD, will pay $65,000 to the family and establish a reasonable accommodation policy for future requests. In addition, the parties agree to revise the management practices, rental agreements, and occupancy rules of Harbor Cove Homeowners Association to better accommodate the needs of persons with disabilities.

11/01/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-156.cfm,Riverside Plaza in Minneapolis Receives National Trust/HUD Secretary's Award for Excellence in Historic Preservation,"WASHINGTON - Riverside Plaza, a historic housing development in Minneapolis, earned the prestigious 2013 National Trust/HUD Secretary's Award for Excellence in Historic Preservation. This award recognizes efforts that advance the Nation's historic preservation goals while providing affordable housing and economic development opportunities for low- and moderate-income residents. Read more about Riverside Plaza and this awards program (www.huduser.org/portal/about/ExcellenceHistPres_2013_1.html).
The Cedar Riverside neighborhood near downtown Minneapolis has been a point of arrival for immigrants since the late 19th century. When the neighborhood declined after World War II, idealistic developers set out to turn 100 acres of low-density propertiesinto a diverse and futuristic community.Fueled by a major HUD initiative, Cedar Square West included 1,300 apartment units and some commercial space. Despite the projects early success, however, political, financial and other problems led to its gradual decline.
In 1988, a group of for-profit and nonprofit investors led by Sherman Associates bought the property and renamed it ""Riverside Plaza."" Even though it was only 37 years old, the property's historical and architectural importance earned it National Register status in 2010, opening the door to major renovation. Sherman Associates used federal and state historic tax credits to help fund a two-year, $65 million rehabilitation that upgraded all 1,300 residential units, making it one of the largest HUD-supported projects in the United States,and the largest affordable housing development in Minnesota.By extending the complex's life, Riverside Plaza filled a critical need for affordable housing in the Twin Cities and set the bar for rehabilitating large-scale 1970s developments. Now Riverside Plaza is again a welcoming gateway for new immigrants, showcasing how preservation can transform not only neighborhoods, but lives as well.
""While each is unique, this year's outstanding Honor Award winners all reflect the importance of protecting what is special and irreplaceable,"" said Stephanie Meeks, president of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. ""Whether it's the spectacular restoration of an iconic public library in St. Louis or the transformation of a warehouse into housing for previously homeless residents in Detroit, this year's Honor Award winners demonstrate how saving places bolsters local economies and creates jobs in communities across the country.""
HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan added, ""There's something wonderful about producing homes working families can afford, creating jobs and stimulating economic growth while at the same time, remaining true to the historic character of a neighborhood. Riverside Plaza has been a fixture in its neighborhood for generations and with this thoughtful redevelopment, it will continue live on for many years to come.""
The award will be presented to Sherman Associates at the Richard H. Driehaus National Preservation Awards ceremony in Indianapolis on November 1, 2013.

11/04/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-155.cfm,HUD Announces Settlement with Bank of America Resolving Allegations of Lending Discrimination Against Women on Maternity Leave,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that Bank of America will pay $45,000 as part of Conciliation Agreements resolving allegations the lender discriminated against pregnant women seeking mortgage loans. HUD had alleged that the Bank of America refused to refinance the mortgages of two couples in California and Texas, because the women were on maternity leave.
Refusing to approve a mortgage loan or provide mortgage insurance because a woman is pregnant or on family leave violates the Fair Housing Act's prohibition against sex and familial status discrimination, which includes individuals who have or are expecting a child.
""No lender should use a woman's pregnancy or maternity leave as a reason to deny a mortgage loan,"" said Bryan Greene, HUD Acting Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""We commend Bank of America for working cooperatively with the Department of Housing and Urban Development in reaching appropriate resolutions of these complaints. Bank of America took affirmative steps to work with government regulators to ensure that its new policies did not conflict with lending guidelines.""
The cases that were the basis for this settlement involved two couples. One couple, from San Jose, California, alleged that Bank of America moved back the closing date on their mortgage refinance because the woman was on maternity leave. The other couple, from Humble, Texas, alleged that Bank of America refused to consider the wife's employment income and denied their application for a mortgage loan because she was on maternity leave. The couple further alleged that when their real estate agent told the loan officer that denying the loan because of the woman's maternity status violated the Fair Housing Act, the loan officer changed his reasons for denying the loan. The couple ultimately obtained a mortgage from a different lender.
Under the terms of the Conciliation Agreements, Bank of America will pay $25,000 to the California couple and $15,000 to the Texas couple. The Bank will also pay $5,000 to the Texas couple's realtor. Additionally, Bank of America will revise its policies to allow applicants on parental leave to be approved for mortgage loans without first returning to active work status. Bank of America will also conduct fair lending training for its employees.

HUD had alleged that the lender's practices contributed to minority borrowers being charged higher Annual Percentage Rates (APRs) and fees than similarly-situated white borrowers, and denied minority applicants loans more often than similarly-situated white applicants.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing discrimination in mortgage lending and real estate-related transactions based on a person's race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status and disability.
""It's creditworthiness and ability to pay that matter when you apply for a loan, not your race or where you come from,"" said Bryan Greene, HUD's Acting Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""This settlement reaffirms HUD's commitment to ensuring that minorities have equal access to mortgage loan products and that lending institutions meet their obligations under the Fair Housing Act.""
This agreement is the result of a complaint that HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity filed against MortgageIT, alleging that the company discriminated against African American and Hispanic borrowers by underwriting, approving, purchasing, and securitizing mortgage loans in a manner that allowed pricing and denial disparities on the basis of race and national origin. A HUD review of MortgageIT's 2007 and 2008 internal loan data alleged that African American and Hispanic borrowers paid APRs that were eight to ten basis points higher, on average than similarly-situated white borrowers. In addition, HUD alleged that African American borrowers were 65 percent and Hispanic borrowers 72 percent more likely to receive higher priced loans than similarly-situated white borrowers, African American and Hispanic borrowers also allegedly paid, on average, $707 and $906 more in fees, respectively. HUD also alleged that African-American applicants were 45 percent more likely to be denied a mortgage loan than similarly-situated white borrowers. Hispanic applicants were allegedly 35 percent more likely to be denied.
Under the terms of the agreement, MortgageIT will establish a $12.1 million fund to compensate borrowers nationwide who were unfairly been denied a loan or whose loans may have contained terms and conditions that violate the Fair Housing Act. Any funds remaining after all victims have been compensated will be distributed to qualified organizations that provide credit and housing counseling, financial literacy, and other related programs that assist African American and Hispanic potential, current, and former homeowners.
Persons who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed at www.hud.gov/fairhousing or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, which can be accessed through Apple devices, such as the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch."

These disaster plans will rely on grants provided earlier this year through HUD's Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program.
Earlier this year, HUD allocated $7,464,000 to support disaster recovery efforts in Shelby County, Tennessee. Local officials developed a plan intended to restore key infrastructure, public facilities, and electrical distribution systems, including the restoration of the Raleigh Millington Road Bridge over the Loosahatchie River. HUD's approval allows the County to begin implementing its plan.
""This is another important step toward recovery and healing,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""Shelby County will now be able to implement its recovery strategies for restoring critically needed infrastructure damaged by these storms.""

HUD will announce additional allocations throughout the year based upon the level of remaining needs to help other states and local communities impacted by natural disasters in 2011-2013.
HUD's CDBG-Disaster Recovery grants are intended to confront housing, business and infrastructure needs beyond those addressed by private insurance and other forms of public assistance. Using a combination of data from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Small Business Administration (SBA), HUD identified those states and local communities requiring the greatest assistance to recover from devastating tornadoes in the Southeast and Missouri; remnants of Hurricanes Irene and Lee in the Northeast and New England; severe flooding in parts of North Dakota; and destructive wildfires in Texas."

The latest data show important progress across many key indicators—as home prices, purchases of new homes, and sales of existing homes continue to show strong annual gains—although officials caution that the overall recovery remains fragile.The full Housing Scorecard is available online at www.hud.gov/scorecard.
""As indicated in the October housing scorecard, the Administration continues to work to stabilize the housing market and help responsible homeowners get back on their feet,"" said HUD Deputy Assistant Secretary for Economic Affairs Kurt Usowski. ""With homeowners' equity at its highest level since 2007 and home prices increasing steadily, it is clear that we are moving in the right direction. As our housing market regains stability, it seems the time is ripe for private capital to begin taking a larger role in the housing finance system.""
""The Administration's Making Home Affordable program continues to provide assistance to struggling homeowners, with more than 1.2 million homeowners receiving permanent modifications through HAMP,"" said Tim Massad, Treasury Assistant Secretary for Financial Stability. ""In addition, the standards set through the program have helped change the industry and helped millions more avoid foreclosure."" The October Housing Scorecard features key data on the health of the housing market and the impact of the Administration's foreclosure prevention programs, including:
The Administration's foreclosure mitigation programs continue to provide relief for millions of homeowners as the recovery from the housing crisis continues. Over 1.8 million homeowner assistance actions have taken place through the Making Home Affordable Program, including more than 1.2 million permanent modifications through the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP). The Administration's programs continue to encourage improved standards and processes in the industry, with HOPE Now lenders offering families and individuals more than 3.8 million proprietary modifications through August.

The Administration's programs continue to encourage improved standards and processes in the industry, with HOPE Now lenders offering families and individuals more than 3.8 million proprietary modifications through August.
Homeowners in HAMP continue to benefit from meaningful payment relief, increasing their long-term likelihood of avoiding foreclosure. As of September, more than 1.2 million homeowners have received a permanent modification through HAMP, saving approximately $547 on their mortgage payments each month- an almost 40 percent savings from their previous payment. This represents a total estimated savings of $22.9 billion in monthly mortgage payments, since the inception of the program. In September, 72 percent of eligible non-GSE mortgages benefited from principal reduction with their HAMP modification. Homeowners currently in HAMP permanent modifications with some form of principal reduction have been granted an estimated $12.1 billion in principal reduction.

Also featured this month in the Administration's Housing Scorecard is a regional spotlight on market strength in the Providence, Rhode Island area. Like many areas across the country, the economic and housing market conditions in the Providence area are improving, but the foreclosure crisis has taken its toll. The Administration's broad approach to stabilize the housing market has been a real help to homeowners in Providence and the surrounding cities.
""As the housing market continues to strengthen nationwide, Providence is also showing signs of significant improvement,"" said Usowski. ""As this Regional Spotlight reports, from the launch of the Administration's assistance programs in April 2009 through the end of August 2013, nearly 26,800 homeowners received mortgage assistance in the Providence metropolitan area. This is a step in the right direction but we still have much to do to repair the damage caused by unsustainable lending in Providence prior to the crisis, and to help the continuing recovery.""
The Housing Scorecard Regional Spotlight features data on the health of the Providence housing market and impact of efforts to help homeowners at the local level including:
Economic and housing market conditions in the Providence MSA are improving. The share of mortgages that remain underwater has dropped to 17.3 percent as of the second quarter of 2013, down from 21.5 percent a year earlier. Jobs in the MSA have been increasing at an average annual rate of 4,025, or 0.7 percent, from the first quarter of 2010 through the second quarter of 2013. The Administration's broad approach to stabilize the housing market has contributed to the improvements as more than 15,600 homeowners received mortgage assistance in the Providence area between April 2009 and August 2013 through the HAMP and FHA loss mitigation programs. An additional 11,200 proprietary mortgage modifications were made during this time through HOPE Now Alliance servicers. Furthermore, the City of Providence and the State of Rhode Island have benefitted from $25 million in funding from the Neighborhood Stabilization Program, and $79 million from the Hardest Hit Fund program. The National Mortgage Settlement is continuing to provide relief for those in Providence and throughout the state of Rhode Island. Under the landmark National Mortgage Servicing Settlement, more than 2,000 Rhode Island homeowners had benefitted from over $150 million in consumer relief as of June 30, 2013. 1,182 of those borrowers, 56% of those helped, received an average of $72,586 in principal reduction on their first and second lien mortgages to help them stay in their homes. In addition, 317 borrowers who were current on their mortgage but too far underwater for a traditional refinancing were able to refinance and save an average of $41,779 over the life of their loans. Nationwide, the settlement has provided more than $51 billion in consumer relief benefits to more than 640,000 families, including over $25 billion in first and second lien principal reduction for 319,559 borrowers. That is in addition to the $2.5 billion in payments to participating states and $1.5 billion in direct payments to borrowers who were foreclosed upon between 2008 and 2011.

EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take 2 months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, 4 months for total starts, and 6 months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as non-sampling error including bias and variance from response, non-reporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (3.2%) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90-percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised about three percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found on our web site listed above.
* 90% confidence interval includes zero. The Census Bureau does not have sufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero."

12/09/2013:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2013/pr13-183.cfm,Obama Administration Releases November Housing Scorecard,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of the Treasury today released the November edition of the Obama Administration's Housing Scorecard - a comprehensive report on the nation's housing market. The latest data show progress among many key indicators. The purchase of new homes and home prices remain strong and foreclosures are down. Although there is much good news, officials caution that the overall recovery remains fragile. The full Housing Scorecard is available online at www.hud.gov/scorecard.
""The November housing scorecard shows that the Obama Administration's continuing efforts to help responsible homeowners are having a positive effect,"" said HUD Deputy Assistant Secretary for Economic Affairs Kurt Usowski. ""The Obama Administration's policies, continuing economic and job growth, and rising house prices have combined to reduce foreclosure starts to levels not seen since 2005. And although the number of homeowners 'underwater' meaning they owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth is down more than 40 percent from its peak, the number remains historically elevated meaning more work needs to be done to ensure the continued stability of the housing market.""
""The standards set by the Making Home Affordable program have transformed the mortgage servicing industry, as have our quarterly servicer assessments,"" said Treasury Deputy Assistant Secretary Tim Bowler. ""While the country as a whole has made significant progress, there is still room for improvement for servicers and the Treasury is committed to applying pressure on the mortgage servicing industry to improve servicer behavior. Although the housing market has largely recovered, there are still homeowners struggling and it is key that we continue to help them.""
Since the beginning of the Making Home Affordable Program, Treasury has required participating servicers to take specific actions to improve their processes through ongoing program reviews. The quarterly Servicer Assessments summarize performance in three categories of program implementation: identifying and contacting homeowners; homeowner evaluation and assistance; and program management and reporting.
For the third quarter of 2013, the Servicer Assessment has been enhanced to present new compliance metrics and related benchmarks. These changes will provide additional insight into the impact of servicer performance on the borrower's experience, allow for trending analysis of all compliance metrics and foster further improvement in servicer performance by tightening performance benchmarks.
Changes to the Servicer Assessment include:
Tightening the performance benchmarks for existing compliance metrics, in addition to expanding the coverage of certain existing metrics; Adding three new compliance metrics, such as servicer compliance with timely assignment of a single point of contact in addition and; Removing three existing compliance metrics.
• Tightening the performance benchmarks for existing compliance metrics, in addition to expanding the coverage of certain existing metrics;
• Adding three new compliance metrics, such as servicer compliance with timely assignment of a single point of contact in addition and;
• Removing three existing compliance metrics.
For the third quarter of 2013, three servicers were found to need minor improvement, three servicers were found to need moderate improvement and one servicer was found to need substantial improvement. All servicers will need to continue to demonstrate progress in areas identified in program reviews. Although this quarter's results indicate one servicer needs substantial improvement, on average servicer performance has improved since the inception of the Servicer Assessment reports. This is evidenced by an average income calculation error rate of 0.8 percent for this quarter.
The November Housing Scorecard features key data on the health of the housing market and the impact of the Administration's foreclosure prevention programs, including:
The Administration's foreclosure mitigation programs continue to provide relief for millions of homeowners as the recovery from the housing crisis continues. Over 1.8 million homeowner assistance actions have taken place through the Making Home Affordable Program, including more than 1.2 million permanent modifications through the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP), while the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) has offered more than 2 million loss mitigation and early delinquency interventions through October. The Administration's programs continue to encourage improved standards and processes in the industry, with HOPE Now lenders offering families and individuals more than 3.8 million proprietary modifications through September. Homeowners in HAMP continue to benefit from meaningful payment relief, increasing their long-term likelihood of avoiding foreclosure. As of October, more than 1.2 million homeowners have received a permanent modification through HAMP, saving approximately $547 on their mortgage payments each month - a nearly 40 percent savings from their previous payment - saving a total estimated $23.5 billion in monthly mortgage payments. In October, 69 percent of eligible non-GSE mortgages benefitted from principal reduction with their HAMP modification. Homeowners currently in HAMP permanent modifications with some form of principal reduction have been granted an estimated $12.4 billion in principal reduction. View the Making Home Affordable Program Report with data through October 2013. The Neighborhood Stabilization Program continues to help communities across all 50 states to address foreclosed and abandoned homes. During the third quarter of 2013, grantees report cumulative completions of newly constructed or rehabilitated housing units under NSP topping 28,000 units, while direct assistance to homeowners reached the 10,500 mark, signaling strong progress toward achieving projected activity under the NSP1, NSP2, and NSP3 programs.

The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. Changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show irregular movement. It takes 3 months to establish a trend for new houses sold. Preliminary new home sales figures are subject to revision due to the survey methodology and definitions used. The survey is primarily based on a sample of houses selected from building permits. Since a “sale” is defined as a deposit taken or sales agreement signed, this can occur prior to a permit being issued. An estimate of these prior sales is included in the sales figure. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimate of total sales is revised about 3 percent. Changes in sales price data reflect changes in the distribution of houses by region, size, etc., as well as changes in the prices of houses with identical characteristics.
