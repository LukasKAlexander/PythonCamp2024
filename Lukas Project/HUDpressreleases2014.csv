01/08/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-002.cfm,"Missouri Apartment Owner Agrees to Pay $20,000 to Resolve Discrimination Charge","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that the owner and management company of a Kansas City, Missouri apartment complex will pay $20,000 to resolve allegations they illegally refused to grant a tenant with disabilities' request to have a live-in caretaker.
The Fair Housing Act requires housing providers to make reasonable accommodations in their rules, policies, practices or services when needed to provide persons with disabilities an equal opportunity to use or enjoy a dwelling.
""When it comes to residents with disabilities, the rigid application of the same rules you apply to others can result in the denial of housing opportunities,"" said Bryan Greene, Acting Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""For over 25 years, federal law has required that housing providers make reasonable exceptions to rules or policies if they are necessary for a person with a disability to receive the same housing benefit others enjoy. HUD will continue to bring these cases to obtain relief for people and to educate the public about these rights and responsibilities.""
The Consent Order resolves a charge of discrimination that HUD filed in last September alleging that Brentwood Manor Apartments, L.P.; its management company, CE Real Estate Services, Inc.; and several affiliated management entities, violated the Fair Housing Act by refusing to waive a policy requiring that the tenant live in her apartment for six months before she could add someone to the lease.
HUD brought the charge following its investigation of a complaint filed with the Department by a woman who, due to her disability, needed someone to live with her to assist with her care before the requisite six-month period elapsed. The woman told the apartment management company that her sister was willing to move into the apartment and provide the necessary care. The woman's doctor documented her need for the accommodation, but the management company denied her request. HUD further alleged that the woman was forced to vacate her apartment and move to different housing out of state because of the management company's refusal to grant her request.
Under the terms of the Initial Decision and Consent Order, the owner and management company will pay the woman $20,000, adopt and implement a reasonable accommodation policy, and provide fair housing training for all employees that interact with tenants.
Persons who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed at www.hud.gov/fairhousing or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, which can be accessed through Apple devices, such as the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch."
01/09/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-003.cfm,Obama Administration Announces the First Five Promise Zone Designees,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Departments of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and Agriculture (USDA) announced today the five inaugural U.S. communities that have been designated as Promise Zones, an intensive and layered approach to revitalizing distressed communities. The Promise Zones will benefit from a comprehensive approach to development that will enhance and connect local assets ranging from schools to housing to jobs.
The first five Promise Zones—located in San Antonio, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Southeastern Kentucky, and the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma—have each put forward a plan on how they will leverage federal partnerships and resources in the most effective ways possible to improve their communities. In exchange, these designees will be able to access federal investments in order to achieve their goals.
""The Promise Zones effort represents a partnership for progress,"" stated HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""Federal agencies will be working with each other, and local leaders, like never before to give distressed communities—urban, rural and tribal—the assets they need to succeed like good schools, safe streets and quality housing. Working together, we are going to give families what every American deserves: a fair chance to succeed. I look forward to working with all parties to chart a new course in these areas, one full of new hope and opportunities for the future.""
""Rural Americans often face the same barriers to income equality as folks in our cities, and that's why the Promise Zones effort focuses on both urban and rural areas,"" said USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack. ""Through intensive outreach and technical assistance, we will provide rural and tribal areas with the tools they need to create new, sustainable economic opportunity today and for generations to come. USDA looks forward to teaming up with partners across the federal government and at the local level to build a brighter economic future for all.""
The five Promise Zones announced today are part of the 20 that will be announced over the next three years. These unique partnerships support local goals and strategies with:
Accountability for Clear Goals: Each Promise Zone has identified clear outcomes they will pursue to revitalize their community, with a focus on creating jobs, increasing economic security, expanding access to educational opportunities and quality, affordable housing, and improving public safety. All Promise Zones will continuously track those outcomes, and have committed to sharing data across their community partners (private-sector, non-profits, federal, state, and local agencies, etc.) so that each partner can work towards improvement and accountability. The Administration will work with the Promise Zones and third party experts to track progress and evaluate results. Intensive Federal Partnership: Each Promise Zone will receive federal staff that will work on the ground, side-by-side local staff, to help communities break down regulatory barriers, use existing funds more effectively, and implement their economic visions. Modeled after the Administration's successful Strong Cities Strong Communities (www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/04/25/supporting-local-communities-building-capacity-and-cutting-red-tape) and Strike Force for Rural Growth and Opportunity (www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome?navid=STRIKE_FORCE) initiatives, which have created unique partnerships between local stakeholders and the federal government, these first five Promise Zones will benefit from intensive federal support at the local level to help them implement their economic and community development goals. Help Accessing Resources: Where necessary to achieve their goals, Promise Zones will be able to access federal investments that further the goals of job creation, additional private investment, increased economic activity, improved access to educational opportunities and quality, affordable housing, and reduction in violent crime. Promise Zones will receive priorities in accessing resources required to carry out their strategic plan from up to 10 agencies, including the Corporation for National and Community Service; the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Education, Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, Justice, Labor, and the Treasury; and the Small Business Administration. National Service: Each Promise Zone will be provided five full-time AmeriCorps VISTA members to support their strategic plan. These VISTAs will recruit and manage volunteers, and strengthen the capacity of Promise Zones to expand economic opportunity. Investing in What Works: In order to be designated as a Promise Zone, these five communities have already demonstrated that they are pursuing evidence-based strategies to improve identified goals and outcomes, and have realigned their own state and local resources to meet these goals and outcomes. In short, these Promise Zone designees are already investing in programs and partnerships that have data proving their effectiveness. This same data will also help direct future federal investments to these Zones. Cutting Taxes for Businesses: Finally, President Obama has proposed cutting taxes on hiring and investment in areas designated as Promise Zones – based upon the proven model of Empowerment Zones tax credits – to attract businesses and create jobs.

The Obama Administration is committed to providing ladders of opportunity so that every American has a fair chance to work hard, better their lives and lift themselves up into a thriving middle class. A child's zip code should never determine his or her destiny; but today, the neighborhood that child grows up in impacts their odds of graduating high school, their health outcomes, and their lifetime economic opportunities."
01/10/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-001.cfm,HUD Awards $16.3 Million to Hundreds of Public Housing Authorities to Promote Family Self-Sufficiency,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today awarded nearly $16.3 million in grants to help public housing residents to gain access to education, job training and employment. HUD's Public Housing Family Self-Sufficiency Program (PH-FSS) helps public housing authorities across the country to hire or retain more than 300 program coordinators who will work directly with families to connect them to the supportive services that meet their individual needs and to become gainfully employed. See local funding announced today.
HUD recently awarded an additional $57 million to hundreds of public housing authorities, allowing them to hire or retain more than one thousand program coordinators to help families participating in the Department's Housing Choice Voucher Program.
""This is a modest investment that can make a world of difference for families looking to find their path to self-sufficiency,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""As America's economy continues to recover, it's critical that we work to make sure every American has the skills and resources they need to successfully compete for jobs in the 21st Century.""
The program coordinators retained or hired through HUD's Family Self Sufficiency programs work directly with residents to connect them with local organizations that provide education and job training and placement opportunities; as well as childcare, counseling, transportation and computer and financial literacy services available in their community. These programs encourages innovative strategies that link public housing and voucher assistance with other resources to enable participating families to find employment; increase earned income; reduce or eliminate the need for rental and/or welfare assistance; and make progress toward achieving economic independence and housing self-sufficiency.
Participants sign a five-year contract that requires the head of the household to obtain employment and no longer receive welfare assistance at the end of the five-year term. As the family's income rises, a portion of that increased income is deposited in an interest-bearing escrow account. If the family successfully completes its FSS contract, the family receives the escrow funds that it can use for any purpose, including paying educational expenses, starting a business or paying debts."
01/10/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-004.cfm,Obama Administration Releases December Housing Scorecard,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of the Treasury today released the December edition of the Obama Administration's Housing Scorecard - a comprehensive report on the nation's housing market. The latest data show progress among many key indicators. Home values continue to rise, contributing to both an increase in homeowners' equity and a decline in underwater borrowers. While there is much good news in this scorecard, officials caution that the overall recovery remains fragile. The full Housing Scorecard is available online at www.hud.gov/scorecard.
""December's Housing Scorecard shows that we are continuing to make progress helping struggling homeowners get back on their feet,"" said Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary for Economic Affairs Edward J. Szymanoski. ""Since the beginning of 2012, the number of homeowners underwater has declined by 5.7 million and homeowners' equity has risen by 55 percent to $9.7 trillion. There remains more work to do to address the 6.4 million homeowners who remain underwater; nevertheless, these are encouraging signs that the housing market recovery is providing millions of American homeowners with more economic security.""
""While the housing market continues to make progress, Treasury remains committed to helping homeowners who are still struggling to make their mortgage payments,"" said Treasury Acting Assistant Secretary Tim Bowler. ""December's Making Home Affordable (MHA) report shows that nearly 1.3 million homeowners have received a permanent modification through the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) and the program has saved homeowners an estimated $24.2 billion to date in mortgage payments.""
Through Treasury's Second Lien Modification Program:
More than 123,000 second lien modifications have been completed through the Second Lien Modification Program (2MP). Homeowners in 2MP with an active permanent modification save a median of $153 per month on their second mortgage, resulting in a median total first and second lien monthly payment reduction of $784, or 41 percent of their median before-modification payment. Homeowners who receive a full extinguishment of their second lien receive a median total first and second lien monthly payment reduction of $1,047, or 53 percent of their before-modification payment. Effective September 2013, Treasury expanded the 2MP program to include qualifying first liens that have been modified under the GSE Standard Modification requirements. When a borrower's first lien is modified under the GSE Standard Modification requirements and the first lien satisfies the HAMP eligibility criteria, the 2MP servicer must offer to modify or extinguish the borrower's second lien under 2MP.

The December Housing Scorecard features other key data on the health of the housing market and the impact of the Administration's foreclosure prevention programs, including:
Home Values Continue to Rise. As of October 2013, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) purchase-only index rose 8.2 percent from last year and ticked up 0.5 percent (seasonally adjusted) from September, showing that home values are now on par with prices in early 2005. The S&P/Case-Shiller 20-City Home Price Index for October posted returns of 13.6 percent over the past 12 months and was up 0.2 percent (not seasonally adjusted) over September, indicating that home values are at the same level as in mid-2004. The Administration's foreclosure mitigation programs continue to provide relief for millions of homeowners as the recovery from the housing crisis continues. Over 1.9 million homeowner assistance actions have taken place through the Making Home Affordable Program, including more than 1.2 million permanent modifications through the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP), while the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) has offered more than 2.1 million loss mitigation and early delinquency interventions through November. The Administration's programs continue to encourage improved standards and processes in the industry, with HOPE Now lenders offering families and individuals more than 3.9 million proprietary modifications through October.

01/16/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-006.cfm,"Obama Administration Announces Seven Additional Cities Participating in the Strong Cities, Strong Communities Initiative","WASHINGTON - Today the Obama Administration announced it is expanding the Strong Cities, Strong Communities (SC2) Initiative to include Brownsville, TX; Flint, MI; Gary, IN; Macon, GA; Rockford, IL; St. Louis, MO; and Rocky Mount, NC. President Obama established SC2 in 2011 as an innovative and flexible program designed to strengthen local capacity, coordinate federal investments, and spark growth in economically distressed communities. The SC2 Initiative was developed through engagement with mayors, Members of Congress, foundations, nonprofits and other community partners who are committed to addressing the challenges facing local governments as they work to create economic opportunity for all residents.
Federal inter-agency expert teams will be deployed to work alongside city leadership, community organizations, local businesses and philanthropic foundations to support the cities'visions for economic growth and development. The primary goal is to help these cities more effectively invest existing resources, provide advice and expertise in support of local priorities, better align federal programs and investments, and facilitate new partnerships and peer learning opportunities wherever possible. In addition, AmeriCorps VISTA members will aid this effort as on-the-ground liaisons with local leaders and citizens to help implement the solutions that meet these communities' needs.
""During these tough fiscal times, it is vitally important that the Administration provides support to those cities in need,"" stated HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""The support provided by the Strong Cities, Strong Communities Initiative is helping local leaders maximize every dollar to spur economic growth, create jobs, and build stronger and safer communities.""
""The goal is to help position these communities to be more economically competitive, which ultimately will create better opportunities and improve the lives for their residents,"" said DPC Director, Cecilia Muñoz. ""The expansion of the Strong Cities, Strong Communities Initiative to these seven new cities is based on the success and proven track record that the SC2 Teams have had, and we hope to repeat that success.""
The SC2 Teams will aim to duplicate the record of success established in the original pilot cities: Chester, PA; Cleveland, OH; Detroit, MI; Fresno, CA; Memphis, TN; New Orleans, LA; and Youngstown, OH. SC2 Teams enabled those communities to more effectively use more than $368 million in existing federal funds and investments. They also provided advice and expertise that have helped these communities make significant progress toward their priorities in economic development, housing, transportation, public safety, and public health, among other areas.
""With help from the White House and Strong Cities, the City of St. Louis will be better positioned to create a more socially, economically and environmentally sustainable city,"" said Francis Slay, Mayor of St. Louis, Missouri. ""Leveraged with our strong support from private and public sectors, SC2 will help us accelerate our economic and community development vision, build strategic partnerships between government and industry, and make more efficient and effective use of taxpayer-funded federal resources.""
""Our selection is a testament to our community's public and private sector commitment to accomplish together what we can't do alone,"" said Lawrence Morrissey, Mayor of Rockford, Illinois. ""As our citizens know, we have tremendous challenges, but we also have tremendous resources. Our partnership with the White House and the Strong Cities program will help us maximize and leverage our resources to address challenges across our community involving crime, housing, education, economic development, and unemployment.""
""Our community is eager to meet and work with the Community Solutions Team assigned to assist Brownsville with the development of a comprehensive plan focused on wellness, education and economic development,"" said Antonio ""Tony"" Martinez, Mayor of Brownsville, Texas. ""We are confident the assistance provided will facilitate a model for other cities across the nation.""
""Participation in the Strong Cities, Strong Communities Initiative will not only strengthen our community now, but will pave the way for lasting relationships with federal government officials. And, it is all happening at an opportune time, during the implementation phase of the visioning and strategic planning process, and while housing plan efforts are underway,"" said David W. Combs, Mayor of Rocky Mount, North Carolina. ""The team's expertise is needed now more than ever, and residents in Nash and Edgecombe counties should be excited to see what we believe will be outstanding results.""
""SC2 will bring additional capacity to the implementation of the new Master Plan for a Sustainable Flint and to the innovative work being done here to improve economic opportunity, neighborhood safety and community quality of life for all of Flint's residents, businesses and students,"" said Dayne Walling, Mayor of Flint, Michigan. ""Flint is transforming into a diverse 21st Century city and SC2 engagement will speed our progress.""
""This represents an important tool in the creation of a better Gary, a city that is designed to provide the best government that tax dollars can buy,"" said Karen Freeman-Wilson, Mayor of Gary, Indiana. ""This not only represents a partnership with the federal government, but the strengthened engagement of our local educational institutions, local medical providers, local foundations, local non-profits and corporate partners. It is our collective goal to be the hardest working SC2 team in the history of the program.""
""As we continue to work in all of our neighborhoods, the technical assistance that Macon-Bibb County will receive from the Strong Cities, Strong Communities team residing here over the next year will enable us to more effectively use federal, state, and local money to improve our community,"" said Robert Reichert, Mayor of Macon-Bibb, Georgia. ""From extending our runway, to attacking blight in our neighborhoods, to attracting businesses and industries of all sizes in to a sustainable urban core, this initiative will have a huge impact on our future.""

EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take 2 months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, 4 months for total starts, and 6 months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as non-sampling error including bias and variance from response, non-reporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (3.2%) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90-percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised about two percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found on our web site listed above.
* 90% confidence interval includes zero. The Census Bureau does not have sufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero.

01/24/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-009.cfm,Cook Inlet Housing Authority Wins Prestigious HUD Secretary Award,"WASHINGTON - Once suffering from blight and high concentrations of poverty, one of Anchorage, Alaska's oldest neighborhoods is now a thriving mixed-use commercial corridor, providing residents with affordable housing and jobs while stimulating the surrounding local economy. Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the American Planning Association (APA) announced the Cook Inlet Housing Authority (CIHA) will receive the 2014 HUD Secretary's Opportunity and Empowerment Award (www.huduser.org/portal/about/OppEmpowerAward_2014_1.html) for its dramatic turnaround of the historic Mountain View Village community.
Presented jointly by HUD and APA, this award honors excellence in community planning resulting in measurable benefits in terms of increased economic development, employment, education, or housing choice and mobility for low- and moderate-income residents. Emphasis is placed on how creative housing, economic development, and private investments have been used in or with a comprehensive community development plan to empower a community.
""The remarkable turnaround of Mountain View Village is an outstanding example of how innovative thinking and the power of partnerships can transform communities,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""The Cook Inlet Housing Authority reminds us that a great vision and a lot of elbow grease can work miracles.""
""CIHA's revitalization efforts have instilled a sense of pride for low-income residents of Mountain View Village,"" said Ann C. Bagley, FAICP, 2014 APA Awards Jury chair. ""Their work proves that specialized, high quality design doesn't have to be expensive.""
Jewel Jones, Executive Director of the Anchorage Community Land Trust, concurs: ""CIHA has mastered the formula of providing high quality housing for low- and modest-income individuals and families. That is not an easy task. To even begin to undertake it requires courage. To actually pull it off takes organizational excellence, superb planning skills, and a willingness to work with neighborhood residents and other investors.""
CIHA identified Mountain View Village as the best location to enact a revitalization program. With the highest Alaska Native population in Anchorage, Mountain View Village also had the highest level need and lowest income. CIHA collaborated with the Mountain View Community Council (MVCC) to align the two organizations' redevelopment preferences, and offer citizens an active role in the planning process. MVCC's goals included decreased absentee landlordism, increased homeownership, and demolition of blighted, deteriorated, or vacant structures, all of which have been accomplished under CIHA.
CIHA selected a scattered site development approach so the housing improvements were not limited to a single block or area of the neighborhood. In the homes they have built, CIHA has utilized a variety of housing styles, colors, and designs. Front porches and exterior lighting are included in every home to deter crime, and landscaping and fencing are used to present barriers to unwanted foot traffic. Families of all sizes can utilize these newly developed residences, as spaces range from studio apartments to four-bedroom single-family homes.
Since 2003, CIHA has also coordinated development efforts along Mountain View's commercial corridor with the Anchorage Community Land Trust (ACLT). By working in alignment, CIHA and ACLT deployed complementary strategic funding. The result is Anchorage's first successful mixed-use commercial corridor, which provides residents with nearby goods and services while simultaneously stimulating the local economy.
CIHA has invested $84 million in Mountain View in land acquisition, redevelopment or development of rentals and immediate homes for sale, and low interest financing for homeowners. CIHA's revitalization efforts include the demolition of 130 blighted structures, building in their place 277 affordable homes. A total of 51 new single family homes have been built for immediate home ownership—50 of those have sold. To date, CIHA has redeveloped a total of 10 percent of all residential units in Mountain View Village. Watch the story behind the transformation of the Mountain View Village neighborhood (www.youtube.com/watch?v=sE63nsJeT14).
CIHA and ACLT recently completed a social and economic impact study to assess the progress of the last eight years of joint revitalization work. Early results show more people choosing to live in Mountain View and staying in their residences longer. Household incomes are on the rise, and local schools are seeing increased parent participation and better student test scores. Stabilizing the housing needs of the residents and investing in creating business opportunities on the commercial corridor has clearly had positive effects.
The 2014 HUD Secretary's Opportunity and Empowerment Award will be presented at APA's National Planning Conference in Atlanta during a special awards luncheon on April 29, 2014. The award recipient also will be profiled in Planning magazine, APA's flagship publication."

01/30/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-008.cfm,"Hammond, Indiana and Hammond Housing Authority Settle Discrimination Complaint","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that the city of Hammond, Indiana, and the Hammond Housing Authority (HHA) agreed to pay Maria Becerra, the former executive director of HHA $200,000 to settle allegations the city and HHA terminated her employment because she administered a HUD-funded rental assistance program that helped minority families move into predominantly white neighborhoods. In addition, HHA agreed to reopen its Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program waiting list and inform the public about the reopening of the list.
In March 2012, Becerra filed a complaint with HUD alleging that in December of 2011 she was wrongfully terminated from her position as Executive Director of the HHA because she assisted persons using HCVs in finding housing in the Hammond neighborhood of their choice. Becerra further alleged that the mayor of Hammond made public statements supporting her ouster, claiming that the HCV program had grown ""out of control"" and ""exploded"" during her tenure.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to discriminate in housing because of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, disability or familial status. The Act also makes it illegal to retaliate against a person for supporting the housing rights of others. In addition, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin in programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance.
""HUD's Housing Choice Voucher program is designed to help lower income families find housing in safe neighborhoods and climb the ladder of social and economic opportunity,"" said Bryan Greene, HUD's Acting Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""We're pleased that, under this Agreement, the HHA commits itself to implement this program in a fair manner and provide greater housing choices for families of all backgrounds.""
The Housing Choice Voucher Program is HUD's major rental assistance vehicle for assisting low-income families, the elderly, and people with disabilities to obtain affordable housing in the private rental market. Rental assistance is provided on behalf of the family or individual, allowing program participants to find their own rental housing, including single-family homes, townhouses, and apartments.
Under the terms of the Conciliation Agreement and Voluntary Compliance Agreement that settled these allegations, relevant city and HHA staff and board members will receive fair housing training; the Mayor of Hammond will issue a public statement in support of HCVs and the HCV program in Hammond; the city and HHA will sponsor a public outreach forum to encourage landlord participation in the HCV program; and HHA will expend at least 97 percent of its annual HCV budget each year."
01/30/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-011.cfm,FHA to Accept More Documents with Electronic Signatures,"WASHINGTON - The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) today announced that it is granting expanded authority to lenders to accept electronic signatures (e-Signatures) on documents associated with mortgage loans. The new policy allows e-Signatures on origination, servicing, and loss mitigation documents, as well as FHA insurance claims, REO sales contracts and related addenda. Current FHA policy allows for electronic signatures only on third party documents such as sales contracts and other documents not controlled by the lender.
""By extending our acceptance of electronic signatures on the majority of single family documents, we are bringing our requirements into alignment with common industry practices,"" said FHA Commissioner Carol Galante. ""This extension will not only make it easier for lenders to work with FHA, it also allows for greater efficiency in the home-buying and loss mitigation process"".
Lenders choosing to employ e-signatures may begin using this policy immediately for single family forward mortgages and FHA's reverse mortgage products, Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECM). Lenders are required to adhere to the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (ESIGN), have specific technology and operational capabilities and controls, documented quality control processes, and the ability to adapt e-Signature to FHA's existing record retention processes.
The e-Signatures policy announced today will help streamline the origination process and help reduce document submission timeframes for borrowers seeking options to avoid foreclosure. Initially, e-Signatures will not be accepted on the mortgage note itself. FHA plans to begin accepting e-Signatures on forward mortgage notes at the end of the year.
A Mortgagee Letter detailing FHA's extended acceptance of e-signatures is posted on the HUD website."
02/07/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-012.cfm,Obama Administration Releases January Housing Scorecard,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of the Treasury today released the January edition of the Obama Administration's Housing Scorecard - a comprehensive report on the nation's housing market. The latest data show progress among key indicators. In 2013, home sales had their strongest performance in several years, foreclosure starts were at their lowest annual level since 2005 and homeowners' equity is up $3.4 trillion since the beginning of 2012. While this scorecard notes positive trends in the housing market, officials caution that the economy is still healing from the Great Recession. The full Housing Scorecard is available online at www.hud.gov/scorecard.
""The January Housing Scorecard shows that the Obama Administration's efforts continue to have a positive effect on the housing market,"" said HUD Deputy Assistant Secretary for Economic Affairs Kurt Usowski. ""In 2013, the number of U.S. properties which started the foreclosure process was down 33 percent from 2012, while sales of previously owned homes rose by 9.1 percent. With foreclosures down, home sales up, and equity continuing to grow, the housing market continues to make slow, but steadily improving progress.""
""This month's Housing Scorecard shows the continued need for and progress of the Making Home Affordable program,"" said Treasury Acting Assistant Secretary Tim Bowler. ""January's Making Home Affordable (MHA) report shows a steady increase in the cumulative number of homeowners receiving permanent mortgage modifications, while more than 258,000 homeowners have found alternatives to foreclosure, participating in a short sale or deed-in-lieu through the Home Affordable Foreclosure Alternatives Program (HAFA).""
The December Housing Scorecard features key data on the health of the housing market and the impact of the Administration's foreclosure prevention programs, including:
Existing Home Sales Continue to Make Gains. In 2013, there were 5.09 million sales of existing homes--9.1 percent higher than in 2012 and the strongest performance since 2006 when sales reached an unsustainable level during the housing boom. A total of 428,000 new homes were sold in 2013, which is 16.4 percent above sales in 2012 and the highest level in 5 years.

The Administration's foreclosure mitigation programs continue to provide relief for millions of homeowners as the recovery from the housing crisis continues. Over 1.9 million homeowner assistance actions have taken place through the Making Home Affordable Program, including more than 1.3 million permanent modifications through the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP), while the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) has offered more than 2.1 million loss mitigation and early delinquency interventions through December. The Administration's programs continue to encourage improved standards and processes in the industry, with HOPE Now lenders offering families and individuals nearly 4.0 million proprietary modifications through November (data are reported with a 2-month lag). In all, more than 8.0 million mortgage modification and other forms of mortgage assistance arrangements were completed between April 2009 and the end of December 2013.

Performance of HAMP modifications continues to improve over time. For modifications seasoned 24 months, 23.6 percent of modifications started in 2011 have disqualified, compared to 28.6 percent of modifications started in 2009. Program data supports that the longer a homeowner remains in HAMP, the more likely he or she is to keep up with their mortgage payments and avoid foreclosure.

Payment reduction is a strong driver of permanent modification sustainability. For example, of modifications seasoned 24 months, only 15.9 percent with a monthly payment reduction greater than 50 percent have been disqualified due to missing three payments. By contrast, those modifications with a payment reduction of 20 percent or less had a disqualification rate of 41.2 percent.

Also featured this month in the Administration's Housing Scorecard is a regional spotlight on market strength in the San Francisco-Oakland-Fremont, CA Metropolitan Statistical Area (San Francisco MSA). Like many areas across the country, the economic and housing market conditions in the San Francisco area are improving, but the foreclosure crisis has taken its toll, with the Oakland metropolitan division experiencing more distress than the rest of the MSA. The Administration's broad approach to stabilize the housing market has been a real help to homeowners throughout the San Francisco MSA. You can read the report here.
""As the housing market continues to improve nationwide, the San Francisco metropolitan area is also showing signs of significant improvement,"" said Usowski. ""As the regional spotlight shows, from the launch of the Obama Administration's assistance programs in April 2009 through December 2013, nearly 73,500 homeowners in the San Francisco metropolitan area have received assistance. This is a positive step in our recovery efforts, but more work must be done to help homeowners in this area struggling from an excess of housing construction and unsustainable mortgage lending in the years leading up to the housing crisis and recession.""
The Housing Scorecard Regional Spotlight features data on the health of the San Francisco MSA housing market and impact of efforts to help homeowners at the local level including:
The foreclosure crisis has had an asymmetrical impact on the San Francisco MSA. The Oakland Metro Division (MD) has fared less well than the other divisions. During the housing bubble, home price appreciation in Oakland peaked earlier and rose higher than the MSA as a whole, but the subsequent decline in home prices was greater for Oakland (45 percent) than for San Francisco (22 percent) and that of the nation (30 percent). From 2000 through 2006, the share of distressed mortgages in the San Francisco MSA--those 90 or more days delinquent or in the foreclosure process—were considerably lower than comparable shares in the rest of the nation. The impact of the 2007-2009 recession, however, was more severe for the San Francisco MSA than for the nation, adding to rising mortgage delinquencies.

Economic and housing market conditions in the San Francisco MSA are improving.The share of mortgages that remain underwater has dropped to 2.5 percent in the San Francisco MD as of the third quarter of 2013, down from 9.0 percent a year earlier; in the Oakland MD, negative equity has declined to 13.9 percent from 29.7 percent over the same period. Jobs in the MSA have been increasing at an average annual rate of 38,900, or 2.1 percent, from the second quarter of 2010 through the third quarter of 2013. The Administration's broad approach to stabilizing the San Francisco housing market has contributed to the improvements as nearly 73,500 homeowners received mortgage assistance between April 2009 and December. Furthermore, the San Francisco MSA has benefitted from $36 million in funding from the Neighborhood Stabilization Program, and the State of California has received $1.975 billion from the Hardest Hit Fund program.

Under the landmark National Mortgage Servicing Settlement, more than 186,000 California homeowners have benefitted from over $20 billion in refinancing, short sales and completed or trial loan modifications, including principal reduction on first and second lien mortgages provided as of June 30, 2013. Nationwide, the settlement has provided more than $51 billion in consumer relief benefits to more than 643,000 families. That is in addition to the $2.5 billion in payments to participating states and $1.5 billion in direct payments to borrowers who were foreclosed upon between 2008 and 2011.

02/26/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-015.cfm,HUD and Census Bureau Report New Residential Sales in January,"WASHINGTON - Sales of new single-family houses in January 2014 were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 468,000, according to estimates released jointly today by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Census Bureau.
This is 9.6 percent (±17.9%)* above the revised December rate of 427,000 and is 2.2 percent (±20.2%)* above the January 2013 estimate of 458,000. The median sales price of new houses sold in January 2014 was $260,100; the average sales price was $322,800. The seasonally adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of January was 184,000. This represents a supply of 4.7 months at the current sales rate.

EXPLANATORY NOTES
These statistics are estimated from sample surveys. They are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated average relative standard errors of the preliminary data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2%) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90-percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. Changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show irregular movement. It takes three months to establish a trend for new houses sold. Preliminary new home sales figures are subject to revision due to the survey methodology and definitions used. The survey is primarily based on a sample of houses selected from building permits. Since a ""sale"" is defined as a deposit taken or sales agreement signed, this can occur prior to a permit being issued. An estimate of these prior sales is included in the sales figure. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimate of total sales is revised about three percent. Changes in sales price data reflect changes in the distribution of houses by region, size, etc., as well as changes in the prices of houses with identical characteristics. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found on our web site listed above.

03/04/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-016.cfm,HUD Awards $2 Million to Boost Job Growth and Business Opportunities along U.S. - Mexico Border,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced $2 million in grants to stimulate job growth and business opportunities in chronically underserved rural areas along the U.S.-Mexico border region. Provided through HUD's Border Community Capital Initiative (""Border Initiative""), grantees expect to leverage an additional $5.5 million from other public and private sources to increase investment in 'colonias' where there are few opportunities for businesses to access private capital.
HUD's Border Initiative is a partnership among three federal agencies - HUD, the Department of the Treasury's Community Development Financial Institutions Fund (CDFI Fund) and the Department of Agriculture - Rural Development (USDA-RD). The grant funding announced today is part of the White House Rural Council (www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/rural-council). The Council was launched by President Obama in 2012 to help create jobs and expand opportunities in rural communities.
HUD grants will provide direct investment and technical assistance to community development lending and investing institutions that focus on affordable housing, small business and community facilities to benefit the residents of colonias. HUD announced grants to the following organizations:
Grantee
Grant Amount
Target Markets
Accion Texas (San Antonio, TX)
$800,000
87 eligible colonias spanning 12 border counties in Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona
Affordable Homes of South Texas (McAllen, TX)
$600,000
Colonias located in Hidalgo, Willacy, Cameron, El Paso, and Webb counties.
Community Resource Group, Inc. (Fayetteville, AR)
$200,000
Colonias along Texas-Mexico Border to include Starr, Hidalgo, Cameron, and Willacy counties.
Tierra Del Sol Housing Corporation (Dona Ana Co., NM)
$200,000
Colonias in Dona Ana and Luna Counties in New Mexico
International Sonoran Desert Alliance (Ajo, AZ)
$200,000
Ajo colonia in Ajo, Arizona
TOTAL
$2,000,000

HUD, USDA-RD and the CDFI Fund have all identified lack of capacity among organizations serving the colonias and similar persistent poverty communities as a limiting factor in the effectiveness of federal programs. Inconsistent availability of limited public funding in any one region or community plays a role in this, because organizations specializing in affordable housing, small business support and community facilities cannot sustain themselves and grow. All of the agencies recognize that the targeted border communities and populations receive insufficient services because they lack organizations with the capacity to effectively respond to community needs. Conversely, higher-capacity organizations working along the border consistently cite lack of access to capital as a major barrier to expansion.
The Border Initiative focuses on improving colonias communities and creating asset building opportunities for residents by helping local financial institutions raise capital and to lend and invest it in their communities. Strengthening local community development lenders and investors will also widen the channels through which larger private institutions and federal agencies can reach potential home owners, renters, business owners, facilities operators and service providers who need their support."
03/04/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-018.cfm,HUD Announces Funding to Provide Permanent Housing and Services to Low-Income People with Disabilities,"WASHINGTON - To help prevent thousands of people with disabilities from experiencing homelessness or unnecessary institutionalization, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced the availability of approximately $120 million in funding for state housing agencies to provide long term project-based rental assistance to extremely low-income persons with disabilities, many of whom are transitioning out of institutional settings or are at high risk of homelessness. Read HUD's Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) (www.grants.gov/custom/viewOppDetails.jsp?oppId=252154).
HUD's support of these state agencies is made possible through the Section 811 Project Rental Assistance (PRA) program which enables persons with disabilities who earn less than 30 percent of their area's median income to live in integrated mainstream settings. State housing agencies are working closely with their state Medicaid and Health and Human Service counterparts to identify, refer, and conduct outreach to persons with disabilities who require long-term services and supports to live independently.
""HUD and HHS are working together to help states reduce health care costs, improving quality of life for persons with disabilities, and helping to end homelessness as we know it,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan.
Authorized by the Frank Melville Supportive Housing Investment Act of 2010, the Section 811 PRA will award rental assistance funds to state housing agencies (or other appropriate entities) that have formed partnerships with state Medicaid and health and human services agencies that have developed methods for identifying, referring, and conducting outreach to a target population of extremely low-income persons with disabilities requiring long term services and supports.
This is a NOFA using funds from FY2013 and FY2014. Deadline to apply is May 5, 2014.
In the last round of funding, 13 states were awarded funds to create approximately 3500 housing units for this vulnerable population.
Today's announcement reinforces the guiding principles of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the landmark 1999 Supreme Court ruling in Olmstead v. L.C., which require state and local governments to provide services in the most integrated settings appropriate to meet the needs of individuals with disabilities.
The funding announced today also supports the Obama Administration's long term strategy to prevent and end homelessness. The Dedicating Opportunities to End Homelessness (DOEH) Initiative is a joint effort by HUD and the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH) designed to help communities match their homeless supports with other mainstream resources such as housing choice vouchers, public housing, private multifamily housing units, and other federally funded services."
03/04/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-019.cfm,HUD Releases Proposed FY2015 Budget,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Shaun Donovan today unveiled HUD's fiscal year 2015 budget proposal. This year The President's Budget provides a roadmap for accelerating economic growth, expanding opportunity for all Americans, and ensuring fiscal responsibility. The Budget adheres to the 2015 spending levels agreed to in the Bipartisan Budget Act and shows the choices the President would make at those levels. But it also shows how to build on this progress to realize the nation's full potential with a fully paid for $56 billion Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative, split evenly between defense and non-defense priorities. Read HUD's proposed FY 2015 budget.
""This year's budget presents a unique opportunity for HUD to work within the frame of the Bipartisan Budget agreement while continuing to build ladders of opportunity for all Americans,"" said Donovan. ""This funding will continue to help strengthen and stabilize our nation's housing market while putting our economy back on the right track and helping those in most need.""
HUD's budget is an essential component of the President's vision of investing in the things we need to grow our economy, create jobs, increase skills training and improve education - while continuing long term deficit reduction.
The budget focuses on four key principals:
Driving Economic Growth by Increasing Access to Credit and Strengthening the Federal Housing Administration; Providing Opportunity by Restoring and Increasing Assistance to Vulnerable Families; Creating Growth and Opportunity through Key Initiatives; and Ensuring Fiscal Responsibility and Increasing Efficiency.
• Driving Economic Growth by Increasing Access to Credit and Strengthening the Federal Housing Administration;
• Providing Opportunity by Restoring and Increasing Assistance to Vulnerable Families;
• Creating Growth and Opportunity through Key Initiatives; and
• Ensuring Fiscal Responsibility and Increasing Efficiency.
While the President's request makes critical investments to speed economic growth—growing neighborhoods of opportunity through Choice Neighborhoods and providing access to credit through FHA—it also includes new savings proposals and some very difficult choices we would not have made in a better fiscal environment.
Despite these tough choices, the FY2015 budget:
HUD's FY2015 Budget Request increases the gross Budget Authority by 2.6% over FY2014 levels, and by 10.1% over FY2013 sequestration levels, to $46.66 billion.
Drives Economic Growth by Increasing Access to Credit and Strengthening the FHA
Estimates that the FHA will end the year with a capital reserve balance of $7.8 billion and will not need a mandatory appropriation from the U.S. Treasury. Creates FHA HAWK - Homeowners Armed with Knowledge - to increase access to credit for first-time homebuyers underserved by the current mortgage market and further strengthen the FHA fund. Increases Housing Counseling by 33% above last year's level, to $60 million.

Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative
The Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative will include concrete, specific proposals to grow our economy and help the middle class and will be fully paid for with a balanced package of spending and tax reforms
It will demonstrate how, by simply closing a few unfair tax loopholes and reforming spending programs, Congress could achieve significant economic goals in research, education, manufacturing and skills training. It will be evenly split between defense and non-defense ($28 billion for each). This is consistent with the model established in the Bipartisan Budget agreement, providing equal dollar-for-dollar increases above the current law discretionary spending caps for both defense and non-defense. (This level would fully eliminate the remaining non-defense discretionary sequestration cuts in FY2015.)
To list just a couple of HUD-specific examples, the Opportunity, Growth and Security Initiative will include:
An additional $280 million for the Choice Neighborhoods Program, to fund comprehensive neighborhood revitalization strategies in 7 to 10 additional high-poverty neighborhoods; An additional $125 million to further expand the Jobs-Plus program to assist a total of 50,000 public housing residents to secure employment and increase their earnings; And $75 million for the Integrated Planning and Investment grants program to support 30-40 regional and community planning efforts that coordinate housing, land use, economic and workforce development, transportation, and infrastructure investments.

03/07/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-017.cfm,Obama Administration Releases February Housing Scorecard,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of the Treasury today released the February edition of the Obama Administration's Housing Scorecard – a comprehensive report on the nation's housing market. The latest data show progress among key indicators. This scorecard notes that purchases of new homes rose, foreclosure completions continued their downward trend, and house prices were stable. While there are positive trends in the housing market, officials caution that the economy is still healing from the Great Recession. The full Housing Scorecard is available online at www.hud.gov/scorecard.
""February's Housing Scorecard continues to show that the Obama Administration's efforts to stabilize the housing market and provide relief to struggling homeowners are having a positive effect,"" said HUD Deputy Assistant Secretary for Economic Affairs Kurt Usowski. ""For example, at the national level, the Federal Reserve Board announced yesterday that homeowners' equity jumped over $400 billion in the fourth quarter of 2013, reaching over $10 trillion for the first time since 2007. At the local level, HUD's Neighborhood Stabilization Program, which helps communities address foreclosed and abandoned homes, has now completed or rehabilitated 32,000 units and provided direct assistance to 10,800 homeowners. However, this encouraging news does not detract from the need to build on this progress as too many homeowners remain underwater and mortgage delinquency rates remain elevated.""
""The standards set by the Making Home Affordable (MHA) program and our quarterly servicer assessments have positively impacted the mortgage servicing industry,"" said Treasury Acting Assistant Secretary Tim Bowler. ""While the housing market as a whole has made significant progress, servicers still have room for improvement and Treasury will continue to press the industry to improve servicer performance. January's MHA report shows that homeowners currently in the Home Affordable Mortgage Program (HAMP) have saved a total estimated $25.5 billion to date in monthly mortgage payments.""
Since the beginning of the Making Home Affordable Program, Treasury has required participating servicers to take specific actions to improve their processes through ongoing program reviews. The quarterly Servicer Assessments summarize performance in three categories of program implementation: identifying and contacting homeowners; homeowner evaluation and assistance; and program management and reporting.
For the fourth quarter of 2013, one servicer was found to need minor improvement, the rest were found to need moderate improvement. On average, servicer performance has improved since the inception of the Servicer Assessment reports.
The February Housing Scorecard features key data on the health of the housing market and the impact of the Administration's foreclosure prevention programs, including:
Homeowners' Equity Continues to Rise. According to the Federal Reserve, homeowners' equity is up nearly $412 billion, or 4.3 percent, in the fourth quarter of 2013, reaching $10.026 trillion—the highest level since the fourth quarter of 2007. Homeowners' equity has risen sharply since the beginning of 2012, with equity up 60 percent, or more than $3.7 trillion, during this period. New Home Purchases Increased. After declining for the last two months, purchases of new homes rose 9.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) of 468,000 (SAAR) in January--the highest unit-pace since mid-2008 and 2.2 percent above sales in January 2013. (Source: HUD and Census Bureau). The Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) continues to help communities across all 50 states address foreclosed and abandoned homes. During the fourth quarter of 2013, grantees report cumulative completions of newly constructed or rehabilitated housing units under NSP topping 32,000 units, while direct assistance to homeowners reached the 10,800 mark, signaling strong progress toward achieving projected activity under the NSP1, NSP2, and NSP3 programs. HARP has helped 3 million underwater homeowners. As of November 2013, FHFA reports the HARP program reached a significant milestone by helping more than 3 million underwater homeowners refinance their homes. Refinance volume has continued to decrease, however, as mortgage rates rise. The Administration's foreclosure mitigation programs continue to provide relief for millions of homeowners. Over 1.9 million homeowner assistance actions have taken place through the Making Home Affordable Program, including more than 1.3 million permanent modifications through the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP), while the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) has offered nearly 2.2 million loss mitigation and early delinquency interventions through January. The Administration's programs continue to encourage improved standards and processes in the industry, with HOPE Now lenders offering families and individuals nearly 4.0 million proprietary modifications through December (data are reported with a two month lag). In all, more than 8.1 million mortgage modification and other forms of mortgage assistance arrangements were completed between April 2009 and the end of January 2014. HAMP Continues Helping Homeowners. Homeowners currently in HAMP permanent modifications with some form of principal reduction have been granted an estimated $13.3 billion in principal reduction. Of all non-Government Sponsored Enterprise (GSE) loans eligible for principal reduction entering HAMP in January, 64 percent included a principal reduction feature.

03/14/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-020.cfm,HUD Announces Finalists in Student Design and Planning Competition,"WASHINGTON - Four student-led teams from across the country are among the finalists selected by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) as part of a competition to encourage research and innovation in affordable housing design and planning. Among these finalists, one team of graduate students will be chosen for the best solution for redevelopment of the Revolutionary War-era DeBaun House in Bergen County, New Jersey into new permanent supportive housing for homeless veterans.
HUD's new Innovation in Affordable Housing Student Design and Planning Competition (www.huduser.org/portal/challenge/about.html) seeks to encourage research and innovation in affordable housing, to raise practitioner and future practitioner capacity, and to foster cross-cutting team-work within the design and community development process.
Multi-disciplinary graduate student teams were asked to create innovative solutions involving design, planning, and finance. The four finalist teams are:
New York University - Team members Ryan Abramow, David Brown, Grant Palermo, Aaron Lenza, Adewale Sotubo designed 22 one-bedroom dwelling units spread over eleven two-story residential buildings. The team proposes that homeless veterans themselves will work together to rehab the DeBaun house. The team also mentioned developing a transportation program.

HUD and the Housing Authority of Bergen County(HABC) challenged these design teams to consider the complex challenges associated with preserving a historic structure, producing affordable housing, and offering a supportive environment for the homeless. These student participants will need to consider design, community development, and financing elements in order to provide an all-encompassing plan and solution that would allow HABC to meet their goal. They will also need to understand the needs of the intended residents, the zoning restrictions, and leveraging opportunities.
The finalists will visit the project site on March 26th to tour the site and the DeBaun House and hear from representatives from the HABC. The competition will culminate on May 6 in a final presentation at HUD Headquarters in Washington, DC. A jury of five academics, practitioners, planners, and architects will hear the presentation of the student finalist teams. Following the jury's decision, HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan will announce the winners. The first place team will receive $10,000 and the runner up will receive $5,000."
03/17/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-022.cfm,HUD Provides Additional $199 Million to Help Colorado Recover from 2013 Storms and Flooding,"DENVER - U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Shaun Donovan today announced the State of Colorado will receive an additional $199.3 million to help communities recover from last September's severe storms that produced devastating floods and mudslides. The recovery funds are provided through HUD's Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program to support long-term disaster recovery efforts in areas with the greatest extent of 'unmet need', primarily in Boulder, Weld and Larimer Counties.
Last December, HUD awarded $62.8 million to assist recovery efforts in Colorado. Today's award brings HUD's combined CDBG-Disaster Recovery investment to $262.1 million. Donovan joined Governor John Hickenlooper and U.S. Senators Mark Udall and Michael Bennet to make the announcement at the Colorado State Capitol.
""After visiting Lyons and Evans in December I promised HUD would do more to help the state recover,"" said Donovan. ""This additional money will fund a local vision to rebuild homes and businesses, repair badly damaged roads and bridges, and spur economic development. While we can never truly replace all that was lost, I remain committed to helping Colorado rebuild more resilient and better prepared for future storms.""
""This week marks six months since the flooding began,"" said Governor John Hickenlooper. ""From the beginning, HUD and our federal partners have been instrumental in investing in Colorado's recovery. This second round of CDBG-DR funds is critical for families, businesses and economic development in the flood-impacted communities. We know we will never make whole those impacted by the floods, but these funds can help us build back sustainable, resilient communities for Colorado's future.""
""Since the catastrophic flood half a year ago, I have been proud to lead efforts in Washington to help Colorado rebuild its devastated communities, protect our homes and businesses from future floods and mudslides, and secure federal aid for flood victims,"" Udall said. ""This second wave of recovery funds will supplement the emergency funds I have already helped secure for Colorado. But while these funds are an important milestone in our recovery efforts, I will keep fighting to ensure Coloradans have every resource we need to rebuild smarter and stronger.""
""These resources will help flood-ravaged communities in our state rebuild their homes and businesses, repair their roads and bridges, and invest in infrastructure to make Colorado more resilient the next time disaster strikes,"" Bennet said. ""We will continue to work together throughout the recovery process to build a stronger Colorado, and we are thankful for Secretary Donovan's support.""
A minimum of 80 percent of the funds awarded today will be targeted in Boulder, Weld, and Larimer Counties where approximately 2,800 homes incurred major or severe damage. Although the majority of this funding is intended to address the remaining disaster recovery and resiliency needs from the September flooding, the state may target remaining funds to other especially hard-hit areas from other major disasters in 2011, 2012, and 2013. Those disasters include the 2012 High Park and Waldo Canyon wildfires, and the 2013 Royal Gorge and Black Forest wildfires.
The Disaster Relief Appropriations Act of 2013, signed into law by President Obama on January 29th, included $16 billion in CDBG-Disaster Recovery funding. The legislation specifies these funds are to be used ""for necessary expenses related to disaster relief, long-term recovery, restoration of infrastructure and housing, and economic revitalization in the most impacted and distressed areas resulting from a major disaster.""
HUD's CDBG-Disaster Recovery grants are intended to confront housing, business and infrastructure needs beyond those addressed by other forms of public and private assistance. Using a combination of data from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Small Business Administration (SBA), HUD identified particular counties in Colorado with the greatest extent of damage to housing, businesses and infrastructure.
HUD will shortly publish a Notice that will regulate the use of the funds announced today. The State of Colorado will then finalize disaster 'action plans' describing how it intends to expend these funds to support disaster recovery and HUD will quickly review them."

""HUD will stand with state and local leaders as they work toward a more resilient recovery and help those people and places that need this support the most.""
The Disaster Relief Appropriations Act of 2013, signed into law by President Obama on January 29, 2013, included $15.2 billion in CDBG-Disaster Recovery funding. HUD's CDBG-Disaster Recovery grants are intended to confront housing, business and infrastructure needs beyond those addressed by other forms of public and private assistance. Using a combination of data from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Small Business Administration (SBA), HUD identified those states and local requiring the greatest assistance to recover in a resilient way from disasters in 2013.
HUD has designated DuPage and Cook County as ""Most Impacted and Distressed"" such that 80 percent of the funds need to be spent in those counties. Because 100 percent of the allocations to Chicago, Cook County, and DuPage County will be spent in those counties, HUD has determined that the State's allocation does not have a minimum expenditure requirement in these two counties and thus may address needs elsewhere in the state that it can demonstrate were ""most impacted and distressed"" by a federally declared disaster in 2011, 2012, or 2013. Other federally declared disasters in Illinois eligible for consideration by the state are severe storms in 2011 (FEMA designated disasters 1960 and 1961) and the severe storms and tornadoes of fall 2013 (FEMA designated disaster 4157)."

These grants are provided through HUD's Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program to support long-term disaster recovery efforts in areas with the greatest extent of 'unmet need.'
The City of Moore will receive an additional $25.9 million to supplement other forms of public and private disaster aid following May's powerful EF5 tornado with its winds exceeding 200 miles per hour. In addition, the State of Oklahoma will receive $83.1 million to support local recovery efforts following these powerful storms that occurred last May and June. The State's funds may also support long-term resilient recovery associated with the Freedom and Noble fires in 2012 and six other major disasters declared in Oklahoma between 2011 and 2013.
To date, HUD has invested nearly $146 million to support long-term disaster recovery in some of Oklahoma:

03/19/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-021.cfm,"HUD and Owner, Architect, and Builder of Missouri Condominium Settle Claim Alleging Complex Design Discriminated Against Persons with Disabilities","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that the architect of Valle Creek Condominiums in Pevely, Missouri will pay $35,000 under an Initial Decision and Consent Order resolving allegations that he and others failed to design and construct dwelling units and common areas at the complex so as to make them accessible to persons with disabilities.
The Fair Housing Act requires that multifamily dwellings constructed for first occupancy after March 13, 1991, contain accessible features for persons with disabilities. The requirements include accessible common areas, bathrooms, kitchens, and doors and environmental controls that can be reached by persons who use wheelchairs. Failing to include these features violates the Fair Housing Act.
The Initial Decision and Consent Order is the result of a Charge of Discrimination that HUD filed against H & H Development Group, Inc.; Larry D. Nelson; Builder's Bloc; Fribis Engineering, Inc.; and Pine Creek Engineering, Inc., alleging that they failed to design and construct a 36-unit building in accordance with the Fair Housing Act's accessibility requirements.
Specifically, HUD's charge alleged that numerous aspects of the building violated the Fair Housing Act, including narrow kitchens that make it difficult for persons using wheelchairs to navigate, thermostats that are too high to be reached by persons using wheelchairs, knob-style hardware on the front doors, mailboxes that cannot be accessed by persons using wheelchairs, and a lack of designated parking and accessible routes to units.
""A wheelchair user cannot fully use and enjoy her home if it has obstacles that the Fair Housing Act intended to eliminate almost 25 years ago,"" stated Bryan Greene, HUD's Acting Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will continue working to ensure that those who design and construct multifamily housing satisfy their legal responsibility to build housing that's accessible to people living with disabilities.""
The case came to HUD's attention after the Metropolitan St. Louis Equal Housing Opportunity Council (EHOC), a non-profit fair housing advocacy organization that receives HUD funds to combat housing discrimination, filed a complaint claiming that EHOC's fair housing testers had found numerous violations of the Fair Housing Act's design and construction requirements at the property.
Under the terms of the Consent Order, Nelson will pay $2,800 in damages to EHOC and $32,200 to establish a Valle Creek Condominiums Retrofit Fund, which will be used to bring the property into compliance with the accessibility requirements of the Fair Housing Act. In addition, Builder's Bloc, a contractor for the property, will perform in-kind work that will correct inaccessible features related to the common areas."
03/19/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-023.cfm,"HUD Awards $1.8 Billion to Improve, Preserve Public Housing","WASHINGTON - U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan today awarded nearly $1.8 billion to public housing authorities in all 50 states, as well as the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, to make major large-scale improvements to the nation's 1.1 million public housing units. View funding by public housing authority here.
The grants announced today are provided through HUD's Capital Fund Program, which provides annual funding to approximately 3,100 public housing authorities to build, repair, renovate and/or modernize the public housing in their communities. These housing authorities use the funding to do large-scale improvements such as replacing roofs or making energy-efficient upgrades to replace old plumbing and electrical systems.
""This funding is critically important to public housing agencies as they work to provide the best housing possible for their residents,"" said Donovan. ""While the funding we announce today will never be enough to meet the tremendous backlog of capital needs, HUD will be working closely with the Congress to expand efforts to generate approximately $6 billion in private investment for the recapitalization of public housing.""
For more than 75 years, the federal government has been working and investing billions of dollars in developing and maintaining public and multifamily housing - including providing critical support through the Capital Fund grants announced today. Still, the nation continues to lose approximately 10,000 public housing units each year, primarily due to disrepair. In 2011, HUD released Capital Needs in the Public Housing Program, a study that estimated the capital needs in the public housing stock in the U.S. The study found the nation's 1.1 million public housing units are facing an estimated $25.6 billion in large-scale repairs. Unlike routine maintenance, capital needs are extensive improvements required to make the housing decent and economically sustainable, such as replacing roofs or updating plumbing and electrical systems to increase energy efficiency.
To help protect the considerable federal investment in public housing, and respond to the growing demand for affordable rental housing, the Obama Administration proposed the Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD), a comprehensive strategy that complements the Capital Fund Program and offers a long-term solution to preserve and enhance the country's affordable housing stock, including leveraging public and private funding to make critically needed improvements.
Since Congress approved the RAD demonstration in November of 2011, early results show it is generating significant additional capital for public and assisted housing. HUD has made awards to 60,000 public and assisted housing units in more than 340 different projects across the country. Through these awards, housing authorities have proposed to generate approximately $3 billion in capital repairs by leveraging private debt and equity, which will preserve or replace distressed units and support local jobs in their communities - all without additional federal resources.
Currently, the Department has received applications from PHAs for an additional 116,000 units under RAD. To support the growing demand for RAD, the President's FY 2015 budget proposal requests to eliminate the RAD cap, which would facilitate the recapitalization of public housing."
03/27/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-027.cfm,HUD and Census Bureau Report New Residential Sales in February,"WASHINGTON - Sales of new single-family houses in February 2014 were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 440,000, according to estimates released jointly today by the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. This is 3.3 percent (±17.9%)* below the revised January rate of 455,000 and is 1.1 percent (±15.2%)* below the February 2013 estimate of 445,000.
The median sales price of new houses sold in February 2014 was $261,800; the average sales price was $317,500. The seasonally adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of February was 189,000. This represents a supply of 5.2 months at the current sales rate.
New Residential Sales data for March 2014 will be released on Wednesday, April 23, 2014, at 10:00 A.M. EDT.
EXPLANATORY NOTES
These statistics are estimated from sample surveys. They are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated average relative standard errors of the preliminary data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2%) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90-percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. Changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show irregular movement. It takes three months to establish a trend for new houses sold.
Preliminary new home sales figures are subject to revision due to the survey methodology and definitions used. The survey is primarily based on a sample of houses selected from building permits. Since a ""sale"" is defined as a deposit taken or sales agreement signed, this can occur prior to a permit being issued. An estimate of these prior sales is included in the sales figure. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimate of total sales is revised about three percent. Changes in sales price data reflect changes in the distribution of houses by region, size, etc., as well as changes in the prices of houses with identical characteristics. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found on our web site listed above.
* 90% confidence interval includes zero. The Census Bureau does not have sufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero.

04/01/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-028.cfm,HUD Marks Fair Housing Month,"WASHINGTON - Each April, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) uses Fair Housing Month to mark the passage of the 1968 Fair Housing Act, the landmark law passed shortly after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. which prohibits housing discrimination based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, disability, and family status. This year's Fair Housing Month theme is ""Fair Housing is Your Right: Use It!"" Throughout the month, HUD will cast a spotlight on the persistent problem that exists in this country, as individuals and families continue to face both blatant and subtle forms of housing discrimination.
HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan launched this year's commemoration at an event featuring the new film ""A Matter of Place (http://vimeo.com/77785957),"" which documents three personal stories of housing discrimination in New York City. Underwritten by a grant provided under HUD's Fair Housing Initiative Program, the film profiles three examples of housing discrimination based on race, sexual orientation, and source of income and features commentary from legal experts, civil rights advocates and fair housing testers.
""This month is an opportunity to recommit to the principle that fair housing is an essential part of everything we do; every grant we make; every building we build; and every community we work with,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""And we will go to the mat in order to ensure the right of every American to fair housing. Although the times have changed - our commitment to this work remains as strong as ever. It is at the core of our mission.""
""Fair Housing Month is an opportunity for all of us to reflect on just how far we've come to make our housing more equitable and how far we still have to go to end housing discrimination,"" said HUD Acting FHEO Assistant Secretary Bryan Greene. ""Fair housing is about giving people the opportunity to pursue their dreams and whenever this opportunity is denied, not only do families lose, our entire nation loses.""
Each year, HUD and communities and organizations across the country recognize Fair Housing Month by hosting an array of activities that enhance the public's awareness of their fair housing rights and promote the nation's commitment to end housing discrimination.
In addition to the legal protections provided under the Fair Housing Act prohibiting housing discrimination based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, disability, and family status, approximately 20 states, the District of Columbia, and more than 150 cities, towns and counties across the nation also prohibit discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals and families. In 2012, HUD published new regulations to ensure that the Department's core housing programs are open to all eligible persons, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. In addition, 12 states and the District of Columbia, as well as several counties and municipalities protect persons against housing discrimination based on their source of income."

04/03/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-031.cfm,HUD's 'Rebuild By Design' Teams Unveil Final Proposals in Regional Resiliency Design Competition,"NEW YORK - After months of research and community engagement across the Sandy-affected region, 10 Rebuild by Design teams unveiled their final proposals Thursday at events at Brookfield Place in Lower Manhattan and Liberty Science Center in Jersey City, NJ. Members of the teams, along with hundreds of tri-state residents and government representatives, are gathering today to view the proposals. U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Shaun Donovan and Rockefeller Foundation President Dr. Judith Rodin will address a public gathering of the design teams and residents of the region tonight at the World Financial Center.
Rebuild By Design teams have focused their efforts on proposals that will improve the resiliency of coastal communities affected by Hurricane Sandy that are still vulnerable to the unpredictable impacts of climate change and rising sea levels. HUD is expected to announce the winners of Rebuild By Design and an allocation of funds at the end of the month.
""This competition has resulted in forward-thinking, comprehensive proposals to make the region more environmentally and economically resilient,"" said Donovan. ""Climate change is presenting unprecedented threats to communities across the country. Rebuild By Design is a model for how we can use public-private partnerships to spur innovation, protect our communities from the effects of climate change, and inspire action in cities across the world.""
""The new reality in New York is we are getting hit by 100-year storms every couple of years,"" said Governor Andrew M. Cuomo. ""Superstorm Sandy was the latest example of a worsening trend in recent years towards highly destructive extreme weather. Along with our NY Rising Community Reconstruction program, Rebuild by Design is leading the way in the development of resiliency projects which are not just about brick and mortar, they create jobs, promote business and education, and ensure safety in waterfront communities.""
""I want to thank HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan for his innovation in leading the Rebuild by Design competition,"" said Governor Chris Christie. ""Sandy was the most sizeable storm to hit in 100 years, bringing billions of dollars in unprecedented destruction to New Jersey's communities, businesses, infrastructure, and natural and cultural resources. Through the work of these talented RBD design teams, we have the opportunity to strengthen our communities in New Jersey and throughout the region to make them more resilient in the face of future storms.""
""There's no question: Superstorm Sandy made clear just how vulnerable we are when it comes to climate change. The risks are real - and growing - and it's vital that we continue to innovate toward a stronger and more resilient New York,"" said New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio. ""We've gotten to work using SIRR as our roadmap, and Rebuild By Design has been a great partner as we identify and meet these challenges. I'm grateful to Secretary Donovan for his leadership, and I look forward to continuing to work together to protect our city and our region.""
""Understanding what really is at stake and what happened during hurricane Sandy informs a path forward that can reconnect the social, the economy and the ecology,"" said Henk Ovink, Principal of Rebuild by Design, and Senior Advisor to Secretary Donovan. ""Design can bridge these gaps and marry science and politics, the real world with imagination. Rebuild by Design is not about making a plan, but about changing a culture.""
Launched in the summer of 2013, the Rebuild by Design competition has produced regional, cross-disciplinary collaboration between state and local governments, international design teams, educational institutions, and the public. The competition is one of the initiatives of President Obama's Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force. It has taken place in partnership with the Municipal Art Society, NYU's Institute for Public Knowledge, Regional Plan Association, and Van Alen Institute.
Lead funding for Rebuild by Design has come from the Rockefeller Foundation, with support from the JPB Foundation, Deutsche Bank Americas Foundation, the Hearst Foundation, the Surdna Foundation, and the New Jersey Recovery Fund.
""These resilience proposals are both visionary and pragmatic, and they represent the culmination of deep local research and community engagement,"" said Dr. Judith Rodin, President of The Rockefeller Foundation. ""The multidisciplinary nature of the teams has resulted in comprehensive solutions that will help protect communities from the physical and financial devastation caused by natural disaster and climate change. Philanthropy is committed to spurring innovation in resilience planning and catalyzing change in every sector: in local communities, in the planning and design professions, and in how critical public decision-making and investments are made.""
""These remarkable results show very clearly the importance of developing solutions that build upon local knowledge and strengthen existing community assets,"" said Vin Cipolla, President of The Municipal Art Society of New York. ""Rebuild By Design has challenged all of us, working in every sector across the City and region and in the federal government, to first think and now plan, design and act together in tangible ways that boost both the livability and resilience of our communities. There is no quick fix: This is the new normal and MAS will continue to advocate for comprehensive, integrated approaches such as the RBD process has produced.""
""The proposals delivered by the Rebuild by Design teams demonstrate the importance of enabling professionals and community leaders to work together to solve problems"" said Robert Yaro, President of Regional Plan Association. ""The plans and partnerships created as a result will help the New York-New Jersey-Connecticut region prepare for a changing climate.""
""Rebuild by Design has become a future-oriented project of historic proportions; seeding, designing, and building a resilience network that now may serve as a cross-disciplinary, collaborative model for coastal regions around the world,"" said David van der Leer, Executive Director of Van Alen Institute.
In addition to the remarks by Secretary Donovan and Dr. Rodin this evening, the New Jersey event features a panel discussion on innovation and implementation. The panel includes Henk Ovink, Rebuild by Design Principal and a senior advisor to Sec. Donovan; Holly Leicht, HUD Regional Administrator for Region II; Marc Ferzan, the New Jersey Director of Hurricane Sandy Recovery Efforts; Chris Daggett, the President & CEO of the Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation; and Dr. Mindy Fullilove, Professor of Clinical of Sociomedical Sciences at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health.
The final 10 design teams involved in Thursday's events were chosen from nearly 150 international submissions. Each of the 10 teams has worked closely with local and regional stakeholders to develop locally-responsive projects and design approaches to improve the resiliency of waterfront communities. The resulting design innovations include growing breakwaters, the development of absorptive shorelines, off-shore islands, and regional tidal parks. Several proposals incorporate coastal development with both ecological and financial resiliency and retrofitting plans aimed at protecting not only exposed environment but also businesses and communities vulnerable to extreme weather.

The latest data show progress among key indicators. In February, foreclosure starts continued their downward trend and, in January, house prices remained stable. While there are positive trends in the housing market, Administration officials caution that the economy is still healing from the Great Recession. The full Housing Scorecard is available online at www.hud.gov/scorecard.
""While there is good news in the March Scorecard, it's clear the housing market is still in the recovery phase of the cycle,"" said HUD Deputy Assistant Secretary for Economic Affairs Kurt Usowski. ""The good news is that homeowners' equity is now over $10 trillion, foreclosure starts are at their lowest levels since 2005, and house prices remain stable, but the recovery is stronger in some markets than in others. Overall, with home sales slowing, too many homeowners still underwater, and mortgage delinquency rates remaining high compared to historic norms, we must sustain our efforts to encourage continuing recovery in the housing market and help responsible homeowners.""
""The Administration's Making Home Affordable program continues to provide assistance to struggling homeowners, with more than 1.3 million homeowners receiving permanent modifications through HAMP,"" said Tim Bowler, Treasury Acting Assistant Secretary for Financial Stability. ""In addition, the standards set through the program have helped change the industry and helped millions more avoid foreclosure.""
The March Housing Scorecard features key data on the health of the housing market and the impact of the Administration's foreclosure prevention programs, including:
House prices remain stable. As of January 2014, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) purchase-only house price index rose 7.4 percent from last year and ticked up 0.5 percent (seasonally adjusted) from December. The FHFA seasonally adjusted purchase-only index for the U.S. shows that home values are on par with prices in mid-2005. The S&P/Case-Shiller 20-City Home Price Index for January posted returns of 13.2 percent over the past 12 months but was down 0.1 percent (not seasonally adjusted) from December. Prices, however, are typically weaker at this time of the year. The Case-Shiller index shows that home values are back to their mid-2004 levels. (The Case-Shiller and FHFA price indices are released with a 2-month lag.)

04/08/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-032.cfm,"Obama Administration Renews Critical Support for Nearly 7,100 Local Homeless Programs Across the U.S.","WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Shaun Donovan today announced nearly $1.6 billion in grants to renew support for 7,100 local homeless housing and service programs across the U.S., Puerto Rico, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands (see attached chart). Provided through HUD's Continuum of Care Program, the funding announced today will ensure these local projects remain operating in the coming year, providing critically needed housing and support services to those persons and families experiencing homelessness.
These grants support a variety of programs including street outreach, client assessment, and direct housing assistance to individuals and families with children who are experiencing homelessness. HUD will award additional grant funding to support hundreds of other local programs in the coming weeks. View a complete list of all the state and local homeless projects awarded funding on HUD's website.
""Whether it's helping to rapidly re-house families with young children or finding a permanent home for an individual with serious health conditions, HUD is working with our local partners to end homelessness as we know it,"" said Donovan. ""Over the last few years we have changed the trajectory of homelessness in America, but we need bipartisan support from Congress to fully fund proven strategies that have created this downward trend. The evidence is clear that the cost of doing nothing far exceeds the cost of finding real housing solutions for those who might otherwise be living on our streets.""
""In the face of budget cuts from sequestration, Continuums of Care and grantees were forced to make difficult choices and do as much as possible to advance their local efforts to end homelessness with fewer resources,"" said Laura Zeilinger, Executive Director of the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness. ""Communities are making the smart choice, investing HUD funds in evidence-based, cost-effective programs. Now we need help from Congress to fully fund these programs and provide communities with exactly what they need to reach the goals of Opening Doors: Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness.""
HUD funding will allow local providers to continue offering permanent and transitional housing to homeless persons as well as services including job training, health care, mental health counseling, substance abuse treatment and child care. HUD is continuing to challenge local communities to reexamine their response to homelessness and give greater weight to proven strategies, from promoting ""Housing First"" to providing 'rapid re-housing' for homeless families with children and permanent supportive housing for those experiencing chronic homelessness.
Continuum of Care grants are awarded competitively to local projects to meet the needs of individuals and families experiencing homelessness in their community. The grants fund a wide variety of programs from street outreach and assessment to transitional and permanent housing for homeless persons and families. HUD funds are a critical part of the Obama Administration's strategic plan to prevent and end homelessness
In 2010, President Obama and 19 federal agencies and offices that form the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH) launched the nation's first comprehensive strategy to prevent and end homelessness. Opening Doors: Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness (www.usich.gov/opening_doors/) puts the country on a path to end veterans and chronic homelessness as well as to end homelessness among children, family, and youth. The Fiscal Year 2013 grants awarded today were reduced in part due to last year's automatic across-the-board budget cuts under sequestration.
Donovan said, ""Like last year's sequestration, any reduction to HUD's homeless assistance programs has a negative impact on local communities' ability to reduce the number of persons living in our shelters and on our streets. It is my hope that Congress will consider the President's 2015 budget request to fully fund these local programs so we can meet our nation's goals of ending homelessness as we know it.""
The President's 2015 Budget seeks $2.4 billion for Homeless Assistance Grants, $480 million above the 2012 enacted level. This level of funding maintains the approximately 224,000 HUD-funded beds that assist the homeless nationwide and expands rapid re-housing and permanent supportive housing.
HUD recently announced its 2013 estimate of the number of homeless persons in America. Approximately 3,000 cities and counties reported 610,000 homeless persons on a single night in January of 2013, down 6.1% since 2010. During the same time, HUD found significant declines among the long-term or chronic homeless population (15.7%) and veterans experiencing homelessness (24.2%)."
04/11/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-033.cfm,"HUD, Nebraska Reach Agreement on Language Access to Housing Programs","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has reached an agreement with the state of Nebraska Department of Economic Development (DED), settling HUD's findings that the state agency failed to sufficiently ensure that persons with limited English proficiency (LEP) have meaningful access to HUD-funded programs.
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin in programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance. This includes a requirement to ensure that programs and activities can be accessed by persons with limited English proficiency, to avoid discrimination based on national origin.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Nebraska's Hispanic population with limited English proficiency increased 77 percent between 2000 and 2010. In addition, the state is also experiencing growing populations of persons of Sudanese and Somali origin. In July 2011, HUD reviewed the Nebraska DED's operations for compliance with civil rights requirements and found that it had failed to comply with its LEP obligations under Title VI.
Between 2008-2010, the state of Nebraska administered more than $54.5 million in HUD funding. HUD's review found that the state did not take any steps to provide access for LEP persons to its HUD-funded programs, nor did it translate program documents, provide translation or interpretation services, or conduct any analyses to identify the needs of eligible LEP persons. HUD's compliance review also determined that the state did not develop a language assistance plan to provide services to LEP persons, and revealed deficiencies in the Nebraska DED's monitoring of grant sub-recipients to determine if they were meeting their Title VI requirements.
""This agreement with the state of Nebraska reflects our mutual commitment to ensuring that all people have meaningful access to HUD-funded programs, regardless of their national origin,"" said Bryan Greene, HUD Acting Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will continue to work with state governments and our other partners to ensure that persons with limited English proficiency aren't unlawfully denied the services they need.""
Under the terms of the agreement, the Nebraska DED will conduct an analysis and develop a language assistance plan identifying the LEP populations it serves and the ways in which it will provide language assistance, including document translation, interpretation at meetings, and community outreach. The Nebraska DED will also provide Title VI training to employees and sub-recipients of federal funding.
HUD published a ""Notice of Guidance to Federal Financial Assistance Recipients Regarding Title VI Prohibition Against National Origin Discrimination Affecting Limited English Proficient Persons"" in 2007.

04/15/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-034.cfm,"HUD and City of Dubuque, Iowa Settle Allegations of Discrimination Against African Americans","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today an agreement with the city of Dubuque, Iowa, settling allegations that the City discriminated against African Americans in the administration of its Housing Choice Voucher Program.
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin in programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance.
The agreement announced today is the result of a review HUD conducted in June 2011, which found that Dubuque imposed policies that discriminated against housing choice voucher applicants based on their race. Specifically, the review found that, in response to racial tensions and concerns about crime, the City established a residency preference point system that effectively imposed a residency requirement, putting those from predominantly African American areas at a disadvantage.
""HUD makes certain that people from all communities are given equal and meaningful access to taxpayer-funded programs,"" said Bryan Greene, HUD Acting Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will continue to work with state and municipal governments to ensure that no one is denied housing choice or housing assistance because of his or her race.""
Dubuque's preference system awarded points to applicants on a cumulative basis. Applicants living within the city received 30 points; applicants within Dubuque County 20 points; and applicants within the state of Iowa 15 points. However, due to the cumulative nature of the point system, in-city applicants received 65 residency points, in-county applicants received 45 residency points, and in-state applicants received 15. In addition, the City restricted applications to the program to only individuals who qualified for one of the local preference points. HUD's review revealed that applicants from the Chicago area who were adversely affected by the residency requirements differed markedly from applicants from within Iowa in one way: race.
After limiting eligibility for the program, the City executed a voucher issuance freeze, so as to decrease the size of the program by roughly two hundred vouchers, and conducted a significant purge of the wait list. Purging removed 90% of the applications from African Americans in 2010. The new policies left only elderly or disabled out of state residents eligible for the program.
Under the terms of the agreement, Dubuque eliminated its residency preference system, and will submit any future changes to its Housing Choice Voucher distribution to HUD for review and approval. In addition, the City agreed to undertake outreach activities to underserved populations, meet increased and expanded reporting requirements, comply with additional oversight from HUD, and obtain fair housing training for core city employees."

EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take two months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, 4 months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2%) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90-percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised about three percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found on our web site listed above.
* 90% confidence interval includes zero. The Census Bureau does not have sufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero.

04/24/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-037.cfm,HUD Awards $29 Million to 26 Local HIV-AIDS Housing Programs,"WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced $29 million in grants to assist more than 1,200 extremely low-income persons and families living with HIV/AIDS annually. This funding will provide these households with a stable living environment, which is essential to accessing healthcare and HIV related services. In addition to housing assistance, these local programs will provide access to the needed supportive services such as life skills, job readiness services and employment training.
The funding announced today is offered through HUD's Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS Program (HOPWA) and will renew HUD's support of 26 local programs in 18 states and the U.S. Virgin Islands (see attached chart and individual project descriptions below).
""These grants will give our local partners a vital resource to keep low-income individuals and families living with HIV/AIDS healthy,"" said Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""Having a place to call home can make all the difference to someone who might otherwise be homeless or on the brink of homelessness.""
The HOPWA program is both a formula entitlement program and a competitive grant program. Ninety percent of HOPWA funds are distributed by formula to cities and states based on the number of AIDS cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. HUD's formula grants are managed by 137 local and state jurisdictions, which coordinate AIDS housing efforts with other HUD and community resources. Overall, these resources assist over 60,000 households annually to provide stable housing and reduced risks of homelessness for those living with HIV and other challenges. Ten percent of HOPWA funds are set aside to fund competitively awarded grants.
This year, HUD continues a policy the Department enacted in last year's competition - encouraging communities to integrate local coordination and planning with local Continuum of Care (CoC) activities. Each of the 26 applicants have committed to coordinating with local CoCs within their primary service area in supporting local HIV/AIDS housing and service needs. This enhanced coordination effort is envisioned to promote integrated and comprehensive approaches to addressing the supportive housing needs of these special needs populations.
Many of the projects receiving renewed funding provide for specialized models in outreach and service delivery, including efforts that target help to persons who have been homeless or are at extreme risk of becoming homeless. The awarded programs are designed to increase coordination with the homeless assistance grant programs as well as other federal resources provided at the local level. These grants offer innovations in HIV care to increase job readiness and employment opportunities for persons in stabilized care.
The grants announced today also support the Obama Administration's Opening Doors (www.usich.gov/PDF/OpeningDoors_2010_FSPPreventEndHomeless.pdf), strategic plan to prevent and end homelessness, and National HIV AIDS Strategy/ HIV Care Continuum, which identifies housing as a key component to reducing viral transmission.
In addressing goals under these strategies, HUD will contribute a variety of housing resources to promote better integration of housing interventions into comprehensive HIV care systems. Housing assistance and related services funded by HOPWA are an essential part of the comprehensive system of care for low-income persons living with HIV/AIDS. A stable home environment is vital for these households to access consistent medical care and maintain their health. Furthermore, secure housing can be a platform for improved quality of life."
04/24/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-038.cfm,"Aurora, Illinois Housing Authority Agrees to Develop 100 Units for Displaced African Americans, Families and Persons with Disabilities","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has reached a Voluntary Compliance Agreement (VCA) with the Aurora, Illinois, Housing Authority (AHA), settling allegations that AHA's rebuilding plan for a demolished public housing complex would have illegally denied housing to persons with disabilities, displaced families with children, and people on AHA's waiting list, the majority of whom are African American. Under the agreement, AHA will develop 100 units of affordable family housing on the site of the demolished complex and in other locations.
The agreement settles a finding by HUD that AHA discriminated against African Americans, families with children, and people with disabilities when it blocked plans to provide replacement housing for the demolished Jericho Circle public housing complex in favor of building 40 scattered-site units that would be designated as supportive housing for veterans, persons with disabilities, and seniors. Additionally, only five percent of units under the new plan were to include accessible design features. HUD had given approval for demolition of the aging Jericho Circle site based on a redevelopment plan that called for creating up to 119 new mixed-income housing units divided between the Jericho Circle site and scattered sites to be acquired from foreclosed single family homes throughout the city. The redevelopment plan, which had been given preliminary approval by the Illinois Housing Development Authority, also called for ten percent of the units to include accessible design features and provided a right of return for the residents of the demolished site.
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin in programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibits discrimination on the basis of a disability under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.
""This agreement helps ensure that former residents of the public housing site and others of diverse backgrounds will have access to scarce housing opportunities,"" said Bryan Greene, HUD's Acting Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will continue to work with housing authorities and local governments to ensure that no one is illegally denied housing.""
The 100 units of affordable family housing will be scattered through the AHA service area, including the city of Aurora and western DuPage County. The units will be developed over a period of five years and will primarily be filled by individuals and families from the AHA's local waiting lists. AHA will also identify former Jericho Circle residents who wish to return to the area. At least ten percent of the units will be designed to be accessible for persons with disabilities.

05/06/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-041.cfm,HUD Announces Settlement with Denver-Area Landlord to Resolve Discrimination Complaint,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today an agreement with the owners and managers of a Denver-area apartment complex to resolve allegations they discriminated against families when they refused to allow children to play outside. Under the terms of the Conciliation agreement, the owner and management company of The Orchards at Cherry Creek Apartments in Centennial agree to construct a $10,000 accessible playground on the property and require employees to attend fair housing training.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in the sale, rental, and financing of dwellings, and in other housing-related transactions, based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, and disability. This includes setting restrictive rules on families with children.
""A requirement of constant parental supervision of all minors, and even teenagers, is oppressive, unnecessary, and unfairly burdensome on families with children"" said Bryan Greene, HUD's Acting Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""The Fair Housing Act protects the rights of families with children to enjoy the same housing amenities that others do.""
HUD filed a Secretary-Initiated Complaint in November 2013, alleging that the apartment complex unfairly restricted the activities of children. A notice published in the complex's monthly newsletter set the following rule:
""All children must be supervised by an adult at all times while playing outside.

05/07/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-042.cfm,HUD Announces Winner in Student Design and Planning Competition,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today announced a team of graduate school students from Ohio State University is the winner of HUD's inaugural Innovation in Affordable Housing Student Design and Planning Competition (www.huduser.org/portal/challenge/about.html). The Ohio State team developed a design plan for the development of a Revolutionary War-era structure in Bergen County, New Jersey into new permanent supportive housing for homeless veterans. HUD selected a collaborative team from New York University and Columbia University as runner up.
HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan said, ""Too often, the contributions of young people are viewed through the prism of the future. But these young minds are demonstrating they can make a real and meaningful difference in the here and now. By developing key partnerships in their planning process, they've shown there is room for innovation in the nation's affordable housing movement that can inspire us all.""
HUD's new student design and planning competition is intended to encourage research and innovation in affordable housing, to raise practitioner and future practitioner capacity, and to foster cross-cutting team-work within the design and community development process. Multi-disciplinary graduate student teams were asked to create innovative solutions involving design, planning, and finance.
The Ohio State University team will receive a $10,000 award and the joint team from NYU-Columbia University will receive $5,000. OSU team members Donald Wiggins, Jr., Shanell Davis, Megahn Kaple, Brad Hosfeld, and Kevin Schildwaster submitted a proposal to rehabilitate two historic buildings with six 650-square foot units each. Half of the residential units will be fully accessible for persons living with disabilities and will include a 21st century gym/physical therapy training center. The team's vision also includes garden and patio spaces to offer residents, visitors, friends, and families to enjoy the outdoors. To reduce winter heating costs, the residential buildings are designed with lightwells to help bring in more light to the units.
HUD and the Housing Authority of Bergen County(HABC) challenged these graduate school design teams to consider the complex challenges associated with preserving a historic structure, producing affordable housing, and offering a supportive environment for the homeless. These student participants considered design, community development, and financing elements in order to provide an all-encompassing plan and solution that would allow HABC to meet their goal. They also incorporated the needs of the intended residents, the zoning restrictions, and leveraging opportunities."
05/08/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-043.cfm,HUD and Fannie Mae Announce Expansion of Green Preservation Plus,"WASHINGTON, DC - Fannie Mae (FNMA/OTC), with support from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Federal Housing Administration (FHA) today announced the expansion of Green Preservation Plus. Formerly known as Green Refinance Plus, Green Preservation Plus supports the preservation of quality affordable multifamily housing in the United States by providing additional funds to improve the energy and water efficiency of properties.
Green Preservation Plus offers financing to owners to acquire multifamily affordable housing properties or to refinance existing Fannie Mae mortgage loans. The expansion of this loan option provides additional loan proceeds through lower debt service and higher loan-to-value ratios. Owners may use these additional loan proceeds to rehabilitate or improve the energy and water efficiency of the property. Energy and water retrofit improvements can significantly reduce energy and water consumption and costs multifamily property. Under Green Preservation Plus, owners may now access the property's equity in an amount up to the cost of the energy- and water-saving improvements being financed. Up to five percent of the loan amount can be added to the mortgage loan to pay for energy- and water-saving improvements.
""The Federal Housing Administration is committed to providing multifamily affordable housing property owners with the necessary financing tools to help implement energy efficiency improvements that will help the owners and tenants save energy and save money,"" said FHA Commissioner Carol Galante.
""We are committed to providing affordable, quality housing for working families. Green Preservation Plus supports this effort by allowing properties to become more efficient and financially strong,"" said Hilary Provinse, Vice President for Multifamily Customer Engagement, Fannie Mae. ""We're pleased to see initial industry interest in our green financing options and to make the benefits available to a broader group of property owners and tenants.""
Property owners will obtain a standard Fannie Mae Physical Needs Assessment with the High Performance Building Module. This Assessment will identify property improvements that reduce energy and water operating costs and consumption and help borrowers make rehabilitation choices that will give them the greatest energy and water savings for their investment. Based upon this Assessment, property owners may select energy- and water-efficiency upgrades that make the most economic sense for their properties.
Green Preservation Plus is an enhancement of the Fannie Mae and HUD/Federal Housing Administration Risk-Sharing Agreement program. Since the inception of the Fannie Mae Multifamily Green Initiative, Fannie Mae has issued $150 million in Green MBS which include Green Preservation Plus loans."
05/09/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-045.cfm,Obama Administration Releases April Housing Scorecard,"WASHINGTON- The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of the Treasury today released the April edition of the Obama Administration's Housing Scorecard - a comprehensive report on the nation's housing market. This month's Housing Scorecard also features a spotlight on the Las Vegas-Henderson-Paradise, NV Metropolitan Statistical Area (Las Vegas MSA). The latest data show progress among key indicators. While house prices remain stable and equity continues to grow, new and existing home sales have slowed. While this scorecard notes positive overall trends in the housing market, officials caution that the harsh winter slowed growth as the economy recovers from the Great Recession. The full Housing Scorecard and spotlight on the Las Vegas MSA are available online at www.hud.gov/scorecard.
""April's Housing Scorecard shows that the housing market is stabilizing, as home prices have risen nearly 7 percent from last year, and foreclosure completions are at their lowest level since mid-2007,"" said HUD Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research Katherine O'Regan. ""However, the harsh winter, fewer distressed properties on the market, and continued tight credit standards have combined to slow the pace of home sales this month, indicating we need to remain vigilant to keep the recovery robust.""
""While the housing market continues to make progress, there are still many homeowners struggling to make their mortgage payments,"" said Treasury Acting Assistant Secretary Tim Bowler. ""Treasury remains committed to helping homeowners through our programs under Making Home Affordable (MHA). As this report shows, nearly 1.3 million homeowners have received a permanent modification through the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) and the program has saved homeowners an estimated $26.8 billion to date in monthly mortgage payments.""
The April Housing Scorecard features key data on the health of the housing market and the impact of the Administration's foreclosure prevention programs, including:
House prices remain stable. As of February 2014, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) purchase-only house price index rose 6.9 percent from last year and ticked up 0.6 percent (seasonally adjusted) from January. The FHFA seasonally adjusted purchase-only index for the U.S. shows that home values are on par with prices in mid-2005. The S&P/Case-Shiller 20-City Home Price Index for February posted returns of 12.9 percent over the past 12 months and was virtually the same (not seasonally adjusted) from January. Prices, however, are typically weaker at this time of the year. The Case-Shiller index shows that home values are back to their mid-2004 levels. (The Case-Shiller and FHFA price indices are released with a 2-month lag.)

Foreclosure completions are at their lowest level since mid-2007. A total of 28,840 U.S. properties were repossessed by lenders (Real Estate Owned, or REO) in March, down 5 percent from February and down 34 percent from a year ago—to the lowest level since July 2007. Newly initiated foreclosures, at 55,710 U.S. properties, were up 7 percent from February but still down 24 percent from one year ago. (Source: Realty Trac).

The Administration's foreclosure mitigation programs continue to provide relief for millions of homeowners as the recovery from the housing crisis continues. More than 2.0 million homeowner assistance actions have taken place through the Making Home Affordable Program, including nearly 1.4 million permanent modifications through the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP), while the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) has offered nearly 2.3 million loss mitigation and early delinquency interventions through March. The Administration's programs continue to encourage improved standards and processes in the industry, with HOPE Now lenders offering families and individuals more than 4.0 million proprietary modifications through February (data are reported with a 2-month lag). In all, more than 8.3 million mortgage modification and other forms of mortgage assistance arrangements were completed between April 2009 and the end of March 2014.

This month's Housing Scorecard also features a regional spotlight on market strength in the Las Vegas-Henderson-Paradise, NV Metropolitan Statistical Area (Las Vegas MSA). Like many areas across the country, the economic and housing market conditions in the Las Vegas area are improving, but the housing crisis and recession hit this area particularly hard and their economic recovery started later. The Administration's broad approach to stabilize the housing market has been provided help to homeowners throughout the Las Vegas MSA.
""As the national housing market continues to improve, the Las Vegas metropolitan area is also showing signs of recovery from the recession,"" said O'Regan. ""As the regional spotlight shows, the Las Vegas MSA was one of the hardest-hit areas during the housing crisis. House prices plummeted by 60 percent during the housing downturn in the Las Vegas area and there was a sharp increase in the number of distressed mortgages. While it's clear Administration efforts have helped the area rebound, more work must be done to help homeowners in this area struggling from an excess of housing construction and unsustainable mortgage lending in the years leading up to the housing crisis and recession.""
The Housing Scorecard Regional Spotlight features data on the health of the Las Vegas MSA housing market and impact of efforts to help homeowners at the local level including:
Economic and housing market conditions in the Las Vegas MSA are improving. Although the recovery from the recession started later in Las Vegas, jobs have been increasing at an average annual rate of 18,450, or 2.3 percent, from the first quarter of 2011 through the fourth quarter of 2013. As of January 2014, the rate of distressed mortgages has fallen from a peak of 19.8 percent to 7.6 percent compared to a decline from 8.0 to 4.5 percent nationally. The share of underwater mortgages remains high but has dropped to 32.6 percent as of the fourth quarter of 2013, down from 55.0 percent a year earlier.

Administration Programs Are Providing Much Needed Relief to the Last Vegas MSA. The Administration's broad approach to stabilizing the Las Vegas housing market has contributed to the improvements as more than 82,100 homeowners received mortgage assistance between April 2009 and March 2014. Furthermore, the Las Vegas MSA has benefitted from $154 million in funding from the Neighborhood Stabilization Program, and the State of Nevada has received $194 million from the Hardest Hit Fund program.

The National Mortgage Servicing Settlement is continuing to provide relief for those in the Las Vegas metropolitan area and throughout the state of Nevada. Under the landmark National Mortgage Servicing Settlement, more than 20,400 Nevada homeowners have benefitted from over $1.9 billion in refinancing, short sales and completed or trial loan modifications, including principal reduction on first and second lien mortgages provided as of June 30, 2013. Nationwide, the settlement has provided more than $50 billion in consumer relief benefits to more than 631,000 families. That is in addition to the $2.5 billion in payments to participating states and $1.5 billion in direct payments to borrowers who were foreclosed upon between 2008 and 2011."
05/09/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-046.cfm,HUD Announces New Renewable Energy Partnerships,"WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced that 27 affordable housing providers and service providers across the nation have committed to installing more than 150 megawatts of on-site renewable energy, more than doubling the amount of renewable energy on HUD-assisted multifamily buildings.
In response to the President's call to join him in advancing opportunity for all Americans, partners across the private and public sectors are making commitments to advance solar deployment and energy efficiency.
The 27 new renewable energy partnerships will create good jobs while cutting carbon pollution and come in response to the President's call to action as part of the White House Solar Summit last month and the Better Buildings Initiative the President launched in 2011. Additionally, the new executive actions announced today by President Obama will bolster investment in energy upgrades in homes and federal buildings, strengthen appliance standards and building codes, and build a skilled solar workforce. Together, the President's executive actions will account for $2 billion in energy efficiency investments in Federal buildings; smarter appliances that will cut carbon pollution by more than 380 million metric tons - equivalent to taking 80 million cars off the road for one year - and will save businesses nearly $26 billion on their energy bills; and training programs at community colleges across the country that will assist 50,000 workers to enter the solar industry by 2020.
""HUD is addressing the issue of climate change by creating opportunities and programs for affordable housing owners to take advantage of renewable energy resources, saving energy and money,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""Thanks to the leadership of our multifamily partners and developers, we are on track to meet and surpass President Obama's challenge to reach 100 megawatts of on-site renewable energy on affordable housing by 2020.""
Across the country, HUD partners, to include affordable housing developers, public housing authorities, financial institutions, and service providers, are choosing to install and use solar energy on affordable and market-rate multifamily properties because it reduces their long-term energy costs and creates jobs that are helping boost local economies. Responding to the President's call to action on solar deployment, the following leaders made commitments that will install more than 150 megawatts of on-site renewable energy, create jobs and reduce carbon pollution:

05/12/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-047.cfm,Affordable Housing Developments Win HUD Secretary Design Award,"WASHINGTON - Four California affordable housing developments are the recipients of the 2014 HUD Secretary's Housing and Community Design Award (www.huduser.org/portal/about/housingCommDesign_2014_1.html), each recognized for excellence in residential housing design. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the American Institute of Architects (AIA) selected 28th Street Apartmentsin South Los Angeles; Kelly Cullen Community in San Francisco; Kings Beach Housing Now in Lake Tahoe; and Sierra Bonita Apartments in West Hollywood as national affordable housing models.
""These designs are proof that when it comes to developing affordable housing, you don't have to choose between form and function,"" said Donovan, himself a trained architect. ""This year's recipients are shining examples of how the latest innovations in design, materials and building techniques are not just for high-end housing but can also offer lower income families exceptional homes they can actually afford.""
The awards will be presented in a special ceremony during the 2014 AIA National Convention and Design Exposition in Chicago in June. The 2013 HUD Secretary's Housing and Community Design Award recipients are:
For Excellence in Affordable Housing Design - This award recognizes architecture that demonstrates overall excellence in terms of design in response to both the needs and constraints of affordable housing.
28th Street Apartments: The28th Street Apartments in south Los Angeles consist of a restored historic YMCA dating from 1926 and a newly constructed five-story, stucco-clad building adjacent to the original building. Designed by noted African-American Architect Paul R. William, the original Spanish Colonial revival masonry building was a focus of African-American social life in the era of segregation and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It now offers 48 supportive housing apartments and employment training for neighborhood youth in an ethnically mixed and chronically underserved neighborhood. Supportive housing units include 23 units for residents at 30 percent of the Area Median Income (AMI), 7 units for residents at 40 percent of AMI, and 18 units for residents at 50 percent of AMI. Thirty of these 48 units are reserved for homeless or mentally ill individuals.
When the YMCA was bought in 2007, the original residential program and pool had been abandoned and entire building had fallen into disrepair. All building services and equipment needed to be replaced. The limited budget was stretched to restore the exterior of the building and adapt the interior for new uses.
The restored structure is now a LEED Certified Gold building. Solar hot water panels now cover the roof, while photovoltaic panels on the south facade provide shade and generate power, leaving the historic building free of attachments. Lightweight perforated metal screens wrap the walkway and stairs of the addition facing the historic building to contrast with the original architecture and highlight its weight and solidity. The metal screens feather at the corners to reveal views of the city.
For Creating Community Connections - This award recognizes projects that incorporate housing within other community amenities for the purpose of either revitalization or planned growth.
Kelly Cullen Community: San Francisco's historic Central YMCA, a valued community resource, has been restored and converted to Kelly Cullen Community, a supportive housing complex serving residents and homeless in the Tenderloin area of the city. Kelly Cullen Community includes a health center, as part of an innovative approach to establishing permanent housing for people who have been chronically homeless or at risk of homelessness. The $55 million renovation of the building has created a housing community of 174 micro-units of approximately 200 square feet each while also preserving the building's sky-lit second floor lobby, full-size gym, and auditorium, as well as its offices and meeting rooms.
The new LEED Commercial Interior Gold-certified primary care and behavioral and mental health clinic occupies 11,700 square feet of former locker room and support space on the ground floor. The original basement swimming pool was converted into a multipurpose room. Residential wings and 24 new units were constructed above the historic gym.
The historic preservation tax credits, which provided partial funding for the project, required a high degree of preservation sensitivity. The small residential units preserve the original window bays with their generous proportions and high ceilings and provide the occupants with ample storage, cooking facilities, and individual bathrooms. Window repairs preserve existing materials and provide energy efficiency and comfort. The new radiant heating system, energy-efficient lighting and ventilation, and use of healthy materials contribute to the well-being of the residents and the sustainability of the building. Terrazzo stairs, tile walls, wood ceilings, and translucent planters around the new grand stairway are compatible with the historic, wood, tile, and marble finishes, which were meticulously restored.
For Community-Informed Design - This award recognizes design that supports physical communities as they rebuild social structures and relationships that may have been weakened by outmigration, disinvestment, and the isolation of inner-city areas.
Kings Beach Housing Now: Kings Beach Housing Nowis an affordable sustainable workforce housing project consisting of nine building on five sites in Lake Tahoe. The development provides low-income workers and families who previously lived in substandard converted motel rooms, cabins, and trailers with safe, energy-efficient places to live. The sites replace dilapidated, inefficient housing with new, LEED Certified Silver apartments that reduce negative impacts on the environment while reusing infill land and preserving Tahoe's beautiful open space. The project offers 77 apartments at five sites in Kings Beach (Brook, Chipmunk, Deer, Fox, and Trout) consisting of a mix of apartments sizes.
The Kings Beach Housing Now development team formed partnerships with community advocates and nonprofit groups to sponsor the first Housing Needs Assessment in Kings Beach. A total of 335 surveys (conducted in both English and Spanish) were collected at community events and at local social service organizations during September 2007. The results of the assessment are now available to all organizations seeking to plan new affordable housing and services for the Kings Beach community. The development team listened closely to the community in its effort to create sustainable housing and strengthen the community as a whole. During the planning and design phases, the development team held more than 30 bilingual community meetings to receive feedback on strategies and insight into the needs of the workforce and business owners.
This state-of-the-art LEED Certified Silver housing places people near jobs and amenities, drastically reducing dependence on cars in a region of heightened environment sensitivity. Additionally, an advanced biofiltration system filters 100 percent of onsite storm water, preventing sediments and pollutants from impacting the health and clarity of the world-renowned water of Lake Tahoe.
For Housing Accessibility - Alan J. Rothman Award: The purpose of this award is to recognize exemplary projects that demonstrate excellence in improving housing accessibility for people with disabilities.
Sierra Bonita Apartments: Sierra Bonita Apartmentsis located in an economically depressed commercial area in West Hollywood comprised of small faltering businesses, bars, and massage parlors, and is adjacent to densely built older rental apartments. Both the housing and services offered at the project are part of a community-wide strategy to strengthen community cohesion and self-empowerment of residents.
Sierra Bonita Apartments is the first all-affordable mixed-use development in West Hollywood, and the first project designed and completed using the city's new Green Building Ordinance. The five-story building includes 42 one-bedroom units for very low-income people living with permanent disabilities, in accordance with the city's commitment to full inclusion of these populations in its diverse community. Community-serving nonprofit organizations occupy 3,000 square feet of street-level space. Passive solar design strategies include integrated solar panel sculptures of photovoltaic modules generating more than 55 kilowatts daily, which powers all the common areas of the building. Meanwhile, a second system of rooftop solar panels provides hot water for the entire building. ENERGY STAR® appliances are used in the apartment units and the commercial and common areas. The landscaping is designed with drought-tolerant, sustainable plant material and is maintained with a computer-controlled irrigation system.
Individuals with disabilities participated in the design and development of the project. Participants asked for outdoor spaces that provide pleasant views from their living rooms, which the project has accomplished. Among the unique features of the building are extensive individual and shared outdoor spaces with landscaping that is fragrant, flowering, and sculptural, as well as low-maintenance and drought-tolerant. Two roof decks on the fifth floor provide additional outdoor space with spectacular urban views. Although the building has air conditioning, its large windows allow cooling by ocean breeze on most days. The project demonstrates there is no need to compromise design in creating housing for economically disadvantaged, physically challenged persons."
05/13/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-048.cfm,FHA Takes Additional Steps to Provide Access to Credit for Underserved Borrowers,"WASHINGTON - Today, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) issued its ""Blueprint for Access"" outlining the additional steps the agency is taking to expand access to credit for underserved borrowers. These steps include encouraging a broader use of housing counseling. This week, HUD will publish a notice in the Federal Register for theHomeowners Armed with Knowledge (HAWK) pilot program to further incorporate housing counseling into the home buying process for borrowers using FHA insured financing.
Under the new pilot, homebuyers will qualify for savings on their FHA-insured loans by completing HUD-approved housing counselingprovided through independent nonprofit organizations that give people the tools they need to understand the rights and responsibilities of homeownership. This counseling is aimed at improving buyers' budgeting skills and housing decisions. In addition the Blueprint for Access includes enhancing FHA's quality assurance efforts. Today HUD announced more information on FHA's Quality Assurance Initiative, intended to provide greater clarity and transparency to FHA approved lenders to encourage lending to qualified borrowers across the credit spectrum.
""This is a win for families, FHA, lenders, realtors and the overall market, which is why we are very excited about its potential impact, said Shaun Donovan, Secretary, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. ""We want to create an environment that encourages responsible behavior and provides clear rules of the road so lenders can originate loans without fear of unanticipated consequences. We want lenders to be able focus on the quality of their processes and lend to all qualified borrowers.""
""FHA's mission is to make sure that there is access to affordable mortgage credit for underserved borrowers and communities,"" said Carol Galante, FHA Commissioner. ""Our blueprint to expand credit access outlines the steps we are taking over the next few months to make that happen. These programs transform the way we do business, make us a better partner, and help reduce risk across the market.""
A healthy housing market is key to a sustainable economic recovery and the economic crisis significantly constrained credit, making it tough for anyone with less than perfect credit to obtain a mortgage. Shutting these creditworthy borrowers out of the market hurts American families and undermines efforts to build more stable communities, create pathways to the middle class, and increase homeownership opportunities for minority and low-wealth borrowers. FHA is committed to finding ways to responsibly increase access for underserved borrowers.
Under the four-year HAWK for New Homebuyers pilot program notice, homebuyers who commit to housing counseling will qualify for tangible savings on their FHA-insured loans. The average buyer would save approximately $325 a year - or almost $9,800 over the life of their loan. FHA proposes that homeowners who complete housing counseling before signing a contract to purchase a home and who complete additional pre-closing housing counseling will receive a 50 basis point reduction in the upfront FHA mortgage insurance premium (MIP) and a 10 basis point reduction in the annual FHA MIP. Choosing to participate in post-closing counseling and a track record of timely mortgage payments will bring even greater benefits. After two years with no serious delinquencies, participants receive an additional 15 basis point reduction in annual MIP. The HAWK program is a strong step toward integrating housing counseling into the home buying process and ensuring broad access to housing counseling services.
Proposed changes to FHA's quality assurance measures will provide clarity and transparency in FHA's policies to encourage lending across the entire credit spectrum - especially for underserved borrowers. Clarity with respect to quality assurance measures enhances access for potential borrowers because lenders can originate loans confidently—knowing their mortgages meet FHA standards. By changing the way FHA provides policy direction and monitors lender compliance and performance, the FHA insurance fund, borrowers, lenders and taxpayers will be better protected.

05/14/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-049.cfm,HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan's Statement on Mortgage Settlement Monitor's Report,"WASHINGTON - A new set of reports from Joseph A. Smith, Jr., the Monitor of the National Mortgage Settlement, shows that the nation's largest mortgage servicers are in compliance with the 29 original metrics of the NMS servicing rules. The report also contains the first test results for Green Tree and shows they failed eight metrics.
Following the issuance of these reports, HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan released the following statement:
""Today's report from the Independent Monitor is another sign that the National Mortgage Settlement's compliance structure is providing American consumers with better service and unprecedented protections. While the compliance process is on-going, the landmark action taken by the Obama Administration and 49 state Attorneys General has already provided American homeowners with $50 billion in relief and reformed the servicing industry so that it is more accountable to consumers.
""I look forward to the Monitor's next report which tests the banks on four new metrics issued in October. These will help the Monitor measure and ensure that the banks are doing a better job sending notices and communicating with struggling homeowners in a timely manner."""

EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take two months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, 4 months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2%) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90-percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised about three percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found on our web site listed above.
* 90% confidence interval includes zero. The Census Bureau does not have sufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero.

05/20/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-051.cfm,HUD Announces Agreement between Advocacy Groups and National Real Estate Company Ensuring Deaf Persons Have Equal Access to Housing,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has negotiatedanagreement between the National Fair Housing Alliance, the Austin Tenants' Council, the National Association of the Deaf,and Bell Partners, a Greensboro, NC-based apartment owner and operator that controls more than 64,000 homes in 15 states, settling allegations that the company's properties in Texas and Georgia denied housing to deaf persons.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to refuse to rent, make housing unavailable or discriminate in the terms, conditions, or privileges associated with the rental of a dwelling on the basis of disability. This includes refusing to rent to persons who are deaf or hard of hearing.
The three advocacy organizations alleged that Bell Partners discriminated against rental applicants who were deaf or hard of hearing based on a series of fair housing tests that the groups performed in Savannah, Georgia, and Austin, Texas, in 2013. Testers posing as rental applicants who are deaf or hard of hearing called to inquire about apartments using the Internet Protocol (IP) Relay system, which allows deaf or hard of hearing individuals to communicate with hearing persons via phone using computer text. Multiple tests were conducted over a period of several months. Agents of Bell Partners allegedly hung up on testers who used the IP Relay system or sent their calls directly to voice mail; in contrast, agents accepted calls from testers not using the IP Relay system. When agents spoke with testers using the IP Relay system, they allegedly quoted higher rental prices and failed to offer the same specials and amenities they offered to testers who did not use the IP Relay system. Agents also allegedly failed to follow up with testers who used the IP Relay system.
""Testing exposes housing discrimination that might otherwise go undetected,"" said Dave Ziaya, HUD's Acting Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""The Fair Housing Act protects all potential renters, including those who are deaf or hard of hearing. HUD will continue to enforce the law to ensure that no one is denied housing because they havea disability.""
Under the terms of the agreements, Bell Partners will pay $175,000 to the National Fair Housing Alliance, including $25,000 in attorneys' fees. Bell Partners will provide fair housing training to both newly-hired and current employees. The training will cover the use of assistive technology for the deaf and hard of hearing, including telecommunications relay services. Additionally, Bell Partners will adopt a written policy addressing equal access to housing opportunities for applicants with disabilities, including deaf and hard of hearing individuals, which outlines the correct handling of telecommunications relay calls and other types of communications with deaf and hard of hearing individuals. Bell Partners will communicate the policy to all agents and managers. Bell Partners will pay the National Association of the Deaf $15,000 for consulting services in the development of these policies.
The Bell Partners agreement follows another settlement HUD reached on behalf of deaf and hard of hearing individuals earlier this year. In February, HUD reached an agreement with Mercy House Living Centers in Santa Ana, CA, settling allegations that the center's employees discriminated against two deaf and hard of hearing Section 8 applicants when they refused a request for an American Sign Language (ASL) interpreter. Under that agreement, Mercy House Living Centers agreed to pay the applicants $17,500 to cover the amount of rent they paid during the seven months that they were unable to participate in the Shelter+Care Program, provide ASL interpreters and other accommodations when necessary to communicate with persons with disabilities, and provide fair housing training for its employees.
HUD also released a Video Series for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing (www.nationalfairhousing.org/FairHousingResources/FairHousingVideosfortheDeafHardofHearing/tabid/ 4244/Default.aspx) produced in collaboration with the National Fair Housing Alliance, Disability independence Group and Sweetwater Media. The 12 videos are in American Sign Language (ASL) with English captioning and they provide legal and practical fair housing information in a format accessible to persons who are Deaf and/or Hard of Hearing. The videos illustratecommon problems faced by persons in the buying, renting, and use of a home. HUD also has an ongoing series of print PSAs in English and Spanish that address housing discrimination faced by those who are deaf or hard of hearing.
If you believe your civil rights have been violatedin buying or renting a home or apartment, you can report it online at www.hud.gov/fairhousing, call 1-800-669-9777 or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, which can be accessed through Apple devices, such as the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch."
05/22/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-053.cfm,HUD Awards $40 Million in Housing Counseling Grants,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today awarded more than $40 million in grants to hundreds of national, regional and local organizations to help families and individuals with their housing needs and to prevent future foreclosures. HUD's housing counseling grants, and the additional funding they help to leverage, will assist more than 1.5 million households find housing, make more informed housing choices, or keep their current homes. See a list of all counseling agencies awarded funding today. (Word version)
""These grants are an essential tool to help families find suitable housing or to keep the homes they have,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""HUD-approved counseling agencies use this funding to support a wide range of services from assisting lower income persons to locate an affordable apartment to helping first-time homebuyers avoid unsustainable mortgages.""
More than $38 million will directly support the housing counseling services provided by 29 national and regional organizations, seven multi-state organizations, 22 State Housing Finance Agencies (SHFAs) and 232 local housing counseling agencies. In addition, HUD is awarding $2 million to three national organizations to train housing counselors who will receive the instruction and certification necessary to effectively assist families with their housing needs.
National and regional agencies distribute much of HUD's housing counseling grant funding to community-based organizations that assist low- and moderate-income families to improve their housing conditions. In addition, these larger organizations help improve the quality of housing counseling services and enhance coordination among counseling providers. Read a summary of each grantee, organized by state. (Word version)
In 2012, HUD released two reports on the impact of HUD-approved housing counseling for families who purchase their first homes and those struggling to prevent foreclosure. In both studies, HUD found housing counseling significantly improved the likelihood homeowners remained in their homes.
Grant recipients utilize funding to address the full range of families' housing counseling needs. This includes helping homebuyers and homeowners realistically evaluate their readiness for a home purchase, understand their financing and downpayment options, and navigate what can be an extremely confusing and difficult process. Grantees also help households find affordable rental housing and offer financial literacy training to individuals and families struggling to repair credit problems that restrict their housing options.
In addition to providing counseling to homebuyers and renters, these organizations assist homeless persons in finding the transitional housing they need to move toward a permanent place to live. Finally, grantees also assist senior citizens seeking reverse mortgages or (HECM). These agencies provide counseling for the rapidly growing number of elderly homeowners who seek to convert equity in their homes into income that can be used to pay for home improvements, medical costs, and other living expenses.
Housing counseling agencies support fair housing by assisting borrowers in reviewing their loan documentation, to avoid potential mortgage scams, unreasonably high interest rates, inflated appraisals, unaffordable repayment terms, and other conditions that can result in a loss of equity, increased debt, default, and even foreclosure. Likewise, foreclosure prevention counseling helps homeowners facing delinquency or default employ strategies, including expense reduction, negotiation with lenders and loan servicers, and loss mitigation, to avoid foreclosure."

05/22/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-055.cfm,"Obama Administration Announces ""311"" Resource for Cities Seeking Innovation and Economic Revitalization","WASHINGTON - Today, the Obama Administration announced the launch of the National Resource Network (the Network), a pilot program designed to serve as a ""311 for Cities."" The program will allow communities nationwide to connect to a network of private and public sector experts that will provide local governments with strategic help on key economic issues and aid the turnaround of local economies. The Network demonstrates the Obama Administration's continued commitment to partnering with mayors, city managers and other local government leaders to provide them with resources to help build ladders of opportunity and promote economic growth and prosperity for residents.
The Network was created out of demand from cities around the country to have access to experts, technical advice, and information that can help them address the mounting challenges of growing inequality, high unemployment, under-performing schools, aging infrastructure and vacant and blighted properties. For many local governments facing dwindling budgets, especially those facing significant economic shocks, these challenges have made it difficult for cities to effectively attract jobs, retain an educated workforce, grow the middle class, and revitalize their economies. The Network will help cities address these challenges through on-the-ground expert engagements and advisory services, among other forms of assistance.
""The National Resource Network embodies this Administration's ongoing commitment to bringing the best of private and public sector expertise to bear to create thriving, economically sustainable cities and help mayors and other local leaders meet the challenges facing their communities,"" said David Agnew, Director of White House Intergovernmental Affairs.
""The assistance and expertise provided by the National Resource Network will allow cities to maximize and better leverage their existing federal investments, and more strategically plan for their economic future and community development priorities,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""The consortium running the Network will harness decades of private and public sector expertise to work alongside mayors and other community leaders to identify new solutions to longstanding challenges.""
Starting today, over 50 cities will have direct access to this ""311 for Cities"" resource, with the ability to receive expert assistance via the Network website www.nationalresourcenetwork.org. City officials will be able to log on and get best practices and advice from national experts on community development, economic development, operations, budget and other key issues. The ""311 for Cities"" service will expand to hundreds of cities nationwide over the next year. Other parts of the website, including a curated and searchable resource library are available to all cities and to the public.
In addition, the consortium will provide on-the-ground support to at least 10 cities during its first year of operations, with dozens of additional cities to be assisted in subsequent years. The team consisting of private and public sector experts will work side-by-side with city leadership for up to 12 months and will assess local needs, provide recommendations, and help cities identify and execute on strategies that advance their economic recovery. Three cities (Fall River, MA; Kansas City, KS; and Miami, FL) and a region encompassing several cities in and around Los Angeles, CA (Compton, CA and Lynwood, CA) have already begun engagements with teams of experts.
The Network is a three-year, $10 million technical assistance program funded by HUD and being implemented by a group of leading experts from the private and public sectors, including Enterprise Community Partners, Public Financial Management, HR&A Advisors, New York University's Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service and the International City/County Management Association. The consortium has committed to fundraising an additional $10 million to leverage the federal investment. The Annenberg Foundation, Ford Foundation and Surdna Foundation have already committed to partnering with and supporting the Network.
""The National Resource Network will draw on the best ideas of the private, public, and non-profit sectors to help mayors and city managers overcome challenges and work toward sustainable, long-term economic recovery,"" said David Eichenthal, Executive Director of the National Resource Network. ""With the support of the Obama Administration and additional backing of the Annenberg Foundation, Ford Foundation and Surdna Foundation, we will be able to work with cities across the nation and help provide strategic assistance that solves problems and gets real results.""
The Network pilot will offer immediate assistance to over 50 cities through the 311 service. These cities will be able to submit questions asking for the best available resources to address their needs, such as strategies to improve bond ratings, reduce crime, strengthen fiscal and operational plans, reform zoning codes, or creating jobs from infrastructure investments. A live member of the Network group will receive questions, and within 3 business days, will send an initial response including an online package of annotated resources, referrals, and tools. As needed, the consortium will also offer follow-up coaching and support by phone to further assist the city.
The Network will also provide assistance to communities partnering with the Obama Administration's Promise Zones Initiative (www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/01/08/fact-sheet-president-obama-s-promise-zones-initiative) as well as cities that will be selected through competition to participate in the Obama Administration's Investing in Manufacturing Communities Partnership (www.eda.gov/challenges/imcp/).
The Network effort recognizes that cities are, and will continue to be, among the key building blocks to American prosperity and the places where families live, work and thrive. For more information on the National Resource Network, please visit www.nationalresourcenetwork.org."
05/23/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-056.cfm,HUD and Census Bureau Report New Residential Sales in April,"WASHINGTON - Sales of new single-family houses in April 2014 were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 433,000, according to estimates released jointly today by the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. This is 6.4 percent (±15.9%)* above the revised March rate of 407,000 and is 4.2 percent (±14.2%)* below the April 2013 estimate of 452,000.
The median sales price of new houses sold in April 2014 was $275,800; the average sales price was $320,100. The seasonally adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of April was 192,000. This represents a supply of 5.3 months at the current sales rate.
New Residential Sales data for May 2014 will be released on Tuesday, June 24, 2014, at 10:00 A.M. EDT.
EXPLANATORY NOTES
These statistics are estimated from sample surveys. They are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated average relative standard errors of the preliminary data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2%) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90-percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. Changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show irregular movement. It takes three months to establish a trend for new houses sold.
Preliminary new home sales figures are subject to revision due to the survey methodology and definitions used. The survey is primarily based on a sample of houses selected from building permits. Since a ""sale"" is defined as a deposit taken or sales agreement signed, this can occur prior to a permit being issued. An estimate of these prior sales is included in the sales figure. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimate of total sales is revised about three percent. Changes in sales price data reflect changes in the distribution of houses by region, size, etc., as well as changes in the prices of houses with identical characteristics. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found on our web site listed above.
* 90% confidence interval includes zero. The Census Bureau does not have sufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero.

05/27/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-057.cfm,HUD Announces Alternative Accessibility Standard for Federally Funded Construction Projects,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is permitting developers of federally funded construction projects to use an alternative design standard to meet the accessibility requirements under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. With a few exceptions, developers may use the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) 2010 Standards (2010 Standards) for accessible design as an alternative to the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS) when undertaking new construction or alterations to existing structures on or after May 23, 2014. Read HUD's notice (www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=HUD-2014-0042-0001).
Section 504 requires that programs or activities receiving federal financial assistance be readily accessible to persons with disabilities, including construction projects. Many of the projects that are subject to HUD's Section 504 regulation and UFAS, however, are also subject to ADA requirements for state and local governments. When both accessibility standards apply, it was previously necessary for recipients to determine on a section-by-section basis which afforded greater accessibility and meet that.
With issuance of the notice, HUD permits fund recipients to use the 2010 Standards, except for specific provisions identified in the notice, as an alternative to UFAS until HUD formally revises its Section 504 regulation. HUD is excepting some provisions of the 2010 Standards because those provisions provide a lower level of accessibility than is currently required under UFAS and HUD's Section 504 regulation.
""This action allows HUD-funded entities the option to design and build using a single accessibility standard, with some adjustments, to meet requirements under both laws,"" said Dave Ziaya, HUD's Acting Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""We believe these streamlined federal standards will help ensure the production of housing and facilities that are open and accessible to persons with disabilities.""
The notice will remain in effect until HUD formally revises its Section 504 implementing regulation."
05/28/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-058.cfm,HUD Returns Housing Authority of New Orleans to Local Control,"WASHINGTON - After more than 12 years, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is returning the Housing Authority of New Orleans (HANO) to local control from federal receivership effective June 30, 2014. HUD took possession of HANO in February of 2002 for substantial default of the agency's obligation set forth in the Annual Contributions Contract (ACC).
In 2009, HUD announced the creation of a local HANO Advisory Panel that served as a sounding board to provide counsel as the receivership team developed clear, identifiable, measureable steps to correct HANO's deficiencies. As a result of their efforts HANO can boast that it's providing housing assistance to 4,500 more families that it was when HUD took it over in 2002.
""I truly believe New Orleans is as strong as it's ever been and now is the right time for the agency to come home,"" said Shaun Donovan, Secretary, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. ""The Agency is now more stable than it's ever been. Thanks to Mayor Landrieu and the members of the Advisory Board, HANO has solid leadership and a strong operational foundation.""
""Today is a significant milestone for our residents as the Housing Authority of New Orleans begins transitioning back to local control from HUD,"" New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu said. ""Following years of mismanagement and substandard housing for residents, HANO has reemerged and once again focused to perform its mission. This has been a long time coming, but the people of New Orleans are ready to once again lead HANO.""
Prior to administrative receivership, HUD, the City of New Orleans, and HANO implemented several reforms and oversight strategies which failed to improve operations at HANO. HANO spent decades in serious default. HANO struggled to obligate grants including millions of dollars in HOPE VI grants, or implement proper procurement to revitalize its aging and obsolete public housing stock. HANO was deficient in other operational areas, such excessive vacant unit turnover time (200 days), over four times the satisfactory number of days.
David Gilmore, appointed by Secretary Donovan to serve as the administrative receiver, led the turnaround efforts. He brought nearly 40 years of experience as a senior level administrator in public housing. Prior assignments included deputy administrator for the Boston Housing Authority, and CEO of housing authorities in Seattle and San Francisco. From 1995 to 2000, Gilmore was the court-appointed receiver of the District of Columbia Housing Authority, where he won national recognition for restoring the nation's worst performing housing authority."
05/29/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-059.cfm,HUD Offers $104 Million to Clean Up Dangerous Lead and Other Hazards in Housing,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development is offering $104 million in grants to clean up lead based paint hazards as well as correct other housing-related health and safety hazards in privately owned, low-income housing. Read HUD's Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) (www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2014-05-23/pdf/2014-12029.pdf).
The funding being offered today directs critical funds to cities, counties and states to eliminate dangerous lead paint hazards in thousands of privately-owned, low-income housing units. These funds are provided through HUD's Lead-Based Paint Hazard Control and Lead Hazard Reduction Demonstration grant programs. To expand the reach of HUD's lead grant funding, HUD is also providing more than $12 million to help communities transform their lead hazard control programs to address multiple housing-related hazards.
""Protecting the health and well-being of children is our top priority,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""We know that housing conditions directly affect the health of its residents. These grants will help communities around the nation protect families from lead exposure and other significant health and safety hazards.""
Matthew Ammon, Acting Director of HUD's Office of Healthy Homes and Lead Hazard Control, added, ""With these grant awards, HUD makes it clear that providing healthy and safe homes for families and children is a priority. You can't be healthy if your home is sick. HUD is committed to protecting children from these hazards, as part our efforts to help make the nation's housing healthy and sustainable.""
Through these grant programs, HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes promotes local efforts to eliminate dangerous lead hazards from lower income homes; stimulates private sector investment in lead hazard control; and educates the public about the dangers of lead-based paint.
Lead Hazard Control Grant Programs
Although lead-based paint was banned for residential use in 1978, HUD estimates that approximately 24 million homes still have significant lead-based paint hazards today. Lead-contaminated dust is the primary cause of lead exposure and can lead to a variety of health problems in young children, including reduced IQ, learning disabilities, developmental delays, reduced height, and impaired hearing. At higher levels, lead can damage a child's kidneys and central nervous system and cause anemia, coma, convulsions and even death.
HUD is making grants available through the following programs: Lead Based Paint Hazard Control - $47 million - These grants will assist states, cities, counties/parishes, Native American Tribes and other units of local government in undertaking comprehensive programs to identify and remediate lead based paint hazards in eligible privately owned rental or owner occupied housing. Application due date: Friday, June 27, 2014. Lead Hazard Reduction Demonstration Grant Program - $45 million - These grants will assist states, cities, counties/parishes, Native American Tribes and other units of local government in urban jurisdictions with at least 3,500 pre-1940 occupied rental housing units develop the most comprehensive programs to identify and remediate lead based paint hazards in eligible privately owned rental or owner occupied housing. Application due date: Friday, June 27, 2014.
HUD will award grants in these two programs to approximately 30 recipients ranging from $3,000,000 to $3,500,000."
05/29/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-061.cfm,HUD Marks National Foster Care Month with New Report on Housing Challenges Faced By Youth Aging Out of Foster Care,"WASHINGTON - Each year, approximately 25,000 young people ""age out"" of the foster care system in the U.S., many of them facing significant risks of becoming homeless. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), in coordination with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), today marked National Foster Care Month (https://www.childwelfare.gov/fostercaremonth/) by releasing a new report chronicling the housing needs of young people leaving foster care, and documenting the array of housing options available to this population.
Housing for Youth Aging Out of Foster Care (www.huduser.org/portal/youth_foster_care.html) seeks to address knowledge gaps related to the housing options available to former foster youth and to provide policymakers with recommendations for future research and policy improvements.
""All the available research underscores that these young people are too often faced with the hard choice of being precariously housed or living on our streets or in our shelters,"" said Dr. Katherine O'Regan, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research. ""As we work toward ending homelessness, policy makers at every level of government must consider the unique challenges of young people who exit a system of care with little or no housing options available to them.""
Adolescents typically age out of foster care on their 18th birthday although a number of states extended the age of emancipation to 21 which permit youth to remain in foster care for up to three more years. Key findings of HUD's study include:
While much is known about the high risk of homelessness among young people aging out of foster care, there is little evidence to support interventions (housing or otherwise) that might prevent or end homelessness among this population.
• While much is known about the high risk of homelessness among young people aging out of foster care, there is little evidence to support interventions (housing or otherwise) that might prevent or end homelessness among this population.
Less than half of all Public Housing Authorities administering HUD's Family Unification Program (FUP) are serving youth, choosing instead to target this form of rental assistance to assist families involved in the child welfare system. In 2013, youth accounted for approximately 14 percent of households assisted under this special purpose voucher program.

Decisions by Public Child Welfare Agencies on whether to serve families, youth or both vary by community and may be influenced by a number of programmatic challenges to serving youth that may be constricting referrals of youth to the public housing agency.

After HUD launched this study in 2012, the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness amended Opening Doors (http://usich.gov/resources/uploads/asset_library/Update2012_FINALweb.pdf), the Federal Government's strategic plan to prevent and end homelessness. This amendment builds upon the goal to end family homelessness by 2020 by outlining particular measures to prevent and end homelessness for unaccompanied youth, including the subpopulation of youth, ages 16-24, aging out of foster care."
05/30/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-062.cfm,HUD and New Jersey Announce Agreement to Expand Hurricane Sandy Recovery Programs,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today announced a mutual agreement with the State of New Jersey to build upon affordable housing opportunities for lower income households whose homes were damaged or destroyed by Hurricane Sandy. The settlement agreement announced today will provide a combined $240 million in direct housing assistance to lower income households, reevaluate all denied applications under the State's disaster housing program, and enhance the State's outreach efforts for those with limited English proficiency.
""This agreement is about opening doors to families who may not have been aware that there is help available to them,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""We've worked closely with the State of New Jersey to make certain taxpayer-funded disaster recovery programs have the broadest possible reach.""
New Jersey Governor Chris Christie said, ""Working together, we have been steadfast in ensuring that the largest amount by far of Sandy housing recovery aid reaches those most in need, and we've already devoted the majority of housing grants to low- and moderate-income families. We can now take that commitment even farther, by bolstering our outreach, providing additional resources for both renters and low- and moderate-income homeowners, and incorporating feedback from housing advocates.""
The agreement resolves a complaint brought by a number of civil rights organizations in the state including the Latino Action Network, the New Jersey NAACP, and the Fair Share Housing Center.
Latino Action Network President Frank Argote-Freyre said, ""This settlement will help Spanish-speaking New Jerseyans and others who are still out of their homes get information that wasn't provided to them before. We have one more chance to get this right, and I am hopeful that this agreement will help.""
New Jersey NAACP President Richard Smith added, ""The settlement is an important step. The NAACP looks forward to seeing the Sandy recovery funds reach the families, seniors, and people with disabilities on whose behalf we filed the complaint.""
Under the terms of the agreement announced today, the State of New Jersey voluntarily agreed to the following:
To allocate $215 million in Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) to replace and develop multifamily housing in the nine counties most impacted by Sandy (Atlantic, Bergen, Cape May, Essex, Hudson Middlesex, Monmouth, Ocean and Union). State has agreed to prioritize the siting of these units in Monmouth, Ocean and Atlantic counties which were most damaged by Sandy and to make sure that at least 60 percent of these units will serve families with children. The state will give initial priority to persons whose homes suffered major or severe damage or who were displaced by Hurricane Sandy. To review and reconsider its decisions on all rejected applications for the Rehabilitation, Reconstruction, Elevation and Mitigation (RREM) Program. RREM provides up to $150,000 to homeowners to restore their damaged homes, including rehabilitation, reconstruction, elevation, and/or mitigation activities. The homeowner must reside in one of the nine impacted counties. To reserve a minimum of $10 million in a new program that will serve low-income homeowners whose homes were damaged by the storm in the nine counties or owners of manufactured housing that was damaged by Sandy. To provide a comprehensive approach to serving people with Limited English Proficiency who would benefit from any of the state's HUD-funded recovery activities including providing interpreters in housing recovery centers, language lines, translation of vital documents, including eligibility information, applications and outreach materials, in the languages most spoken in the nine impacted counties. To provide an additional $15 million to support restoration of public, federally assisted, and supportive housing. To offer an additional $10 million in vouchers to support low income renters. To conduct outreach activities on its Sandy recovery activities including the programs covered by the agreement to low- and moderate-income persons and those who are not English proficient.

05/30/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-060.cfm,HUD Announces Third Round of Disaster Recovery Funds to Sandy Region,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced a third round of grant funding, totaling more than $2.5 billion, to help four states and New York City continue recovering from Hurricane Sandy. Provided through HUD's Community Development Block Grant - Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) Program, these recovery funds will assist impacted communities to meet remaining unmet housing, economic development and infrastructure needs.
As part of HUD's CDBG-Disaster Recovery grants that are allocated based upon currently available disaster data, the Department is awarding $930 million to help grantees implement winning proposals from its Rebuild by Design competition. This competition has produced design solutions that represent the leading edge in innovative approaches to incorporating resilience into recovery and rebuilding. HUD will announce the winning Rebuild by Design proposals soon.
Since the passage of the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act of 2013, HUD has now allocated $14 billion of the $15.2 billion in available CDBG-DR funds, including $13 billion to assist communities located in the region impacted by Hurricane Sandy. The third round of funding announced today is intended to support remaining unmet recovery needs that continue to confront these communities. HUD is announcing the following allocations today:
""HUD has worked very closely with officials in the region impacted by Hurricane Sandy to ensure that this funding meets all of their critical housing needs,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan who chaired President Obama's Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force. ""We will continue working with the grantees to ensure they have the resources they need to help families get back into their homes and to rebuild the region smarter, stronger, and better prepared for future storms.""
New Jersey Governor Chris Christie said, ""New Jersey has enjoyed a very strong and collaborative relationship with Secretary Donovan and HUD throughout our recovery from Superstorm Sandy. My Administration will continue to work with HUD to get families back into their homes as quickly as possible and pursue opportunities to help communities build back in stronger and more resilient ways. This third round of more than $880 million in disaster relief funding from HUD will enable New Jersey to continue to prioritize our housing needs for Sandy-affected families, including clearing the RREM wait list and providing significant additional resources for renters.""
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said, ""New Yorkers are grateful to HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan for his extraordinary leadership of the Federal Government's recovery efforts. HUD has worked closely with the State to ensure that we move quickly and effectively to get assistance to those devastated by these storms. With this third allocation of $600 million we have now been allocated more than $4 billion, the single largest award of CDBG-DR funds from HUD. The combined allocations of New York State and New York City total more than $8 billion that will be used to return people to their homes and rebuild New York State communities better, stronger and more resilient than ever before. We understand that other communities across the country also suffered from natural disasters and we support efforts to rebuild nationwide.""
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio added, ""The City and HUD have worked closely together to ensure that we can meet the needs of New Yorkers still struggling to recover from the devastation caused by Sandy. We are deeply grateful to Senator Charles Schumer for his extraordinary leadership in making this important step possible. This new funding, combined with the CDBG-DR housing assistance the City has already received, and HUD's continued commitment to work with us, ensures that we'll be able to provide the support that every homeowner in the Build It Back pipeline needs and deserves.""
""I commend and thank HUD for including Rhode Island in the third round of disaster recovery funds,"" Governor Lincoln D. Chafee said. ""With these federal funds, we will continue to focus on rebuilding in ways that make our communities stronger, more economically sustainable and more resilient. Throughout this process, the Obama Administration has been diligent in awarding federal funds that support Rhode Island and putting our people to work in programs that benefit all Rhode Islanders.""
Connecticut Governor Dan Malloy said, ""Today's announcement that Connecticut will receive another allocation of federal disaster funds is welcome news. I thank President Obama and Secretary Donovan for their ongoing commitment to Connecticut. There is more work to be done, of course, and I will continue to advocate on behalf of the state for more resources to support our efforts to rebuild stronger from Hurricane Sandy. I appreciate that we have strong federal partners in this effort.""
HUD allocates CDBG-Disaster Recovery funds based on the best available data from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Small Business Administration disaster loan programs, the Department of Transportation, and the Army Corps of Engineers to identify the areas of greatest need in the region impacted by Hurricane Sandy. These allocations will be published in the Federal Register in the coming weeks along with criteria for their use.
Rebuild by Design is an innovative design competition that has brought together interdisciplinary design teams, academics, and local communities in an effort to promote resiliency. These awards will allow grantees to execute forward-thinking local recovery projects that can be replicated throughout the region and, potentially, across the country.
In this third Sandy allocation, grantees will be required to identify unmet needs for housing, economic development and infrastructure. Grantees will be required to incorporate a risk assessment in their planning efforts to ensure long term resilience.
HUD, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board, which was established by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, will provide oversight to prevent and identify waste, fraud and abuse. In addition, the Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force, established by President Obama to coordinate the federal government's efforts to support local rebuilding, has established a Project Management Office to monitor spending and progress to ensure the money is used as intended."

Rebuild by Design was created in the summer of 2013 by President Obama' Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force as a way to develop ideas capable of dramatically improving the physical, ecological, and economic resilience of coastal areas. The competition has produced regional, cross-disciplinary collaboration between state and local governments, the ten design teams, regional nonprofit organizations, educational institutions, and the public. The Rockefeller Foundation has been the lead financial supporter of the competition. Teams worked to create coalitions with local and regional stakeholders to develop locally-responsive proposals to improve the resilience of waterfront communities.
""The winning proposals are truly transformative and serve as blueprints for how we can safeguard the region and make it more environmentally and economically resilient,"" said Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""It' my hope that Rebuild by Design will inspire other public-private partnerships to spur innovation and resilience in other parts of the country and around the world. By investing in these proposals, we are going to ensure that when the next storm comes, the region will be safer and better prepared.""
Governor Andrew Cuomo said, ""Building stronger and more robust infrastructure is essential to preparing for the new reality of extreme weather, and with the support of our federal partners New York is becoming a national leader in storm resiliency. From implementing storm mitigation measures along the southern shore of Nassau County to fortifying the Hunts Point section of New York City, this funding will go a long way toward protecting New Yorkers and their communities. HUD continues to be a tremendous supporter of New York' infrastructure needs, and I am pleased to be working with them to build back stronger, safer, and better than ever before.""
""Are there going to be other storms like Sandy? Yes. Will we be better prepared for them because of Rebuild by Design? Absolutely. These four New York projects use the best science we know of to protect against future storms, all while fitting into the character of the neighborhoods and improving their quality of life,"" said U.S. Senator Charles Schumer. ""All due credit for this program goes to Secretary Donovan and his Rebuild by Design Team for their efforts to push forward smarter resiliency that will be effective and last.""
Mayor Bill de Blasio said, ""Countless New Yorkers found themselves without power, heat, or running water after Sandy hit. With a changing climate, we know it's not a question of if, but when the next big storm will hit- and that's why we have a comprehensive plan to adapt our city's infrastructure and neighborhoods. The Rebuild by Design projects announced today are a part of that plan and will help ensure that we're better prepared for the risks of the future. Thank you to HUD and Secretary Donovan, Senator Schumer, Governor Cuomo, and the Rockefeller Foundation, and congratulations to the winning teams. Now, let's get to work.""
""There is no doubt that climate change is real and that it is here,"" said U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand. ""As we learn the lessons of Superstorm Sandy, these bold, inventive projects will bring together some of the brightest minds and best ideas to help develop a storm-resilient strategy and ensure that communities throughout New York are armed with innovative practices to protect against future disasters.""
""The Rockefeller Foundation is keenly focused on the global priority of building greater resilience,"" said Dr. Judith Rodin, President of The Rockefeller Foundation. ""There are no simple solutions, but we do have the best minds in the world figuring how to do things better and smarter. The Rockefeller Foundation funded the Rebuild by Design competition to create a space for talents of every stripe to break the models and construct innovative and creative ways to build for our future. The winning proposals will be beneficial to all of us in both directly improving Sandy-impacted communities, but also by providing models around which successes can be replicated.""
""Rebuild by Design' process took ten interdisciplinary design teams on an in-depth journey through the region, working with and within the communities, discovering the region' vulnerabilities and interdependencies to focus on the opportunities for a new standard of resilience,"" said Henk Ovink, Principal of Rebuild by Design, Dutch Government Liaison to Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task force and Senior Advisor to Secretary Donovan. ""Through this collaborative design process, the teams delivered innovative solutions that bridge the gap between social and physical vulnerabilities. I am so proud of these teams, the communities and their partners for giving the region a new way forward. They showed that this is not about making a plan, Rebuild by Design is about changing a culture.""
The Rebuild by Design competition is a partnership between government, philanthropy, and nonprofit organizations. Lead funding for the effort has come from the Rockefeller Foundation, with support from the JPB Foundation, Deutsche Bank Americas Foundation, the Hearst Foundation, the Surdna Foundation, and the New Jersey Recovery Fund. The competition was administered in partnership with the Municipal Art Society, NYU' Institute for Public Knowledge, Regional Plan Association, and Van Alen Institute.
Winning Proposals
The BIG Team - The BIG U (East River Park) - Manhattan
The BIG proposal presents a protective system around Manhattan' edge, driven by the needs and concerns of the community. Building on the New York City Special Initiative for Recovery and Rebuilding (SIRR) report, the BIG Team married infrastructure investments with a community approach.
The overall proposal protects ten continuous miles of low-lying geography that comprise an incredibly dense, vibrant, and vulnerable urban area. The proposed system not only shields the city against floods and stormwater, it also creates and provides social and environmental benefits to the community through an improved public realm.
CDBG-DR funds will be used to implement the first phase of the proposal along the Lower East Side, creating a ‘bridging berm’ at the East River Park. The bridging berm provides robust vertical protection for the Lower East Side from future storm surge and rising sea levels. The berm also offers pleasant, accessible routes into the park, with many unprogrammed spots for resting, socializing, and enjoying views of the park and river. Both the berms and bridges will be wide and planted with a diverse selection of salt tolerant trees, shrubs, and perennials to create a resilient urban habitat.
OMA - Resist, Delay, Store, Discharge - Hoboken, Weehawken, Jersey City
The comprehensive urban water strategy developed by the OMA Team provides protection along all of the Hoboken waterfront and parts of Weehawken and Jersey City. It deploys programmed hard infrastructure and soft landscape for coastal defense (resist); policy recommendations, guidelines, and urban infrastructure to slow rainwater runoff (delay); a circuit of interconnected green infrastructure to store and direct excess rainwater (store); and water pumps and alternative routes to support drainage (discharge). The objectives are to manage water for both severe storms and long-term growth; enable reasonable flood insurance premiums through the potential redrawing of the FEMA flood zone following completion; and deliver co-benefits that enhance the cities and the region.
Jersey City, Hoboken and Weehawken are susceptible to both flash flooding and storm surge. CDBG-DR funds will support the first phase of the proposal that provides a comprehensive approach for Hoboken that recognizes the density and complexity of the urban area, brings together a diverse community of beneficiaries, and defends the entire city, its assets, and citizens.
HUD funding for this project is intended to incentivize additional public and private investment by reducing risk and driving down insurance premiums. this investment provides a unique opportunity to create a new form of public-private financing mechanism that is locally-driven but participated in by multiple levels of government as well as investors and property owners. Such a ""Flood Development Corporation"" or ""Resilience District"" model would create real financial savings for a variety of stakeholders as a result of infrastructure improvements and other resilience measures.
The Interboro Team - Living With the Bay (Slow Streams) - Nassau County, Long Island
The Interboro teams proposal presents a comprehensive, regional resiliency plan for Nassau County' South Shore. The plan consists of a variety of elements which provide a range of integrated adaptive measures that keep Nassau County residents safe, while adding to the economic, ecological, and social quality of the region.
CDBG-DR funds will implement the ""Slow Streams"" element of the proposal. The areas around Southern Nassau' north-south tributaries are threatened both by surge water flooding and storm water inundation. The proposal will address these threatsthrough a set of interconnected interventions, transforming the Mill River into a green-blue corridor that stores and filters water, provides public space, and creates room for new urban development. These river corridor improvements will also address other challenges such water quality, ecological recovery, and aquifer recharge.
MIT CAU+ZUS+URBANISTEN - New Meadowlands - Little Ferry, Moonachie, Carlstadt, Teterboro
The New Meadowlands project articulates an integrated vision for protecting, connecting, and growing this critical asset to both New Jersey and the metropolitan area of New York. The first phase of their proposal focuses on Little Ferry, Moonachie, Carlstadt, and Teterboro. By integrating transportation, ecology, and development, the project transforms the Meadowlands basin to address a wide spectrum of risks, while providing civic amenities, and creating opportunities for new redevelopment.
CDBG-DR funds will be used for the first phase pilot area to restore water-absorbing wetland and reduce flooding in Sandy-impacted communities. The project includes the creation of additional wetlands and a multi-purpose berm that will provide flood protection to the many residents of the community damaged by Sandy flooding.
SCAPE/Landscape Architecture - Living Breakwaters - Tottenville, Staten Island
Funding for the Scape proposal is to build out the entire Tottenville section of the Living Breakwaters project which will reduce risk, revive ecologies, and connect educators and local students to the shoreline, inspiring a new generation of harbor stewards and a more resilient region over time. The in-water solution will reduce wave action and erosion, lowering risk from heavy storms by designing ""reef street"" micropockets of habitat complexity to host finfish, shellfish, and lobsters. The proposal examines how and where it can most effectively protect communities. This living infrastructure will be paired with social resiliency frameworks in adjacent neighborhoods. Through the Billion Oyster Project and an associated network of programmed water hubs, local schools will be empowered with science, recreation, education, and access to the water.
PennDesign/OLIN - Lifelines, Hunts Point, South Bronx
Hunts Point is the hub of the region' food supply chain and a local living-wage employment center in the poorest Congressional district in the country. The PennDesign/OLIN proposal sets out four strategies: Integrated and Adaptable Flood Protection systems to safeguard the whole neighborhood and create public amenities along the Hunts Point waterfront; Leadership efforts to build capacity for social resilience; a Marine Emergency Supply Chain to enhance the waterways as critical infrastructure; and Cleanways to improve air quality.
CDGB-DR funds for this proposal are not for full implementation, but for continued robust planning and study related to the future of the food market and a small pilot/demonstration project (to be selected/identified by the City). This will enable the process to continue and incorporate whatever investments the private sector and the City commit toward improvements and implementation in the future.
The following projects are Finalists:
WB/unabridged with Yale/ARCADIS - Resilient Bridgeport - Bridgeport, CT
This proposal provides a set of integrated coastal, urban, and riparian design strategies and planning principles. CDBG-DR funds ($10 million) will be dedicated to focus on flood protection in the South End/Blackrock Harbor area, with a particular emphasis on protection of public housing (Marina Village and Seaside Village).
HR&A Advisors, Inc. with Cooper, Robertson, & Partners - Commercial Corridor Resiliency - The Rockaways & Red Hook (NYC), Asbury Park, NJ
This proposal provides design solutions for increasing the resilience of commercial corridors in New York and New Jersey waterfront communities. Opportunities exist for adapting these solutions into a series of design tools/approaches for merchants, retail property owners, and business improvement districts. When combined with the innovative financing tools articulated in the proposal, these can become a critical resource provided by state and local business assistance programs.
Sasaki/Arup/Rutgers - Resilience + The Beach - Union Beach/Keansburg, Asbury Park, Berkeley Township/Tom's River
This proposal puts forward a comprehensive resilience strategy for various types of Jersey Shore communities: Inland Bay, Headlands, and Barrier Island. Opportunities exist for continued focus on examining alternatives for expanding eco-tourism in the Barnegat Bay region that will help reduce economic dependency on barrier island economies.
WXY/WEST 8 Proposal - Blue Dunes - Offshore Islands, NY Harbor
This proposal examines the feasibility of developing offshore constructed islands as living habitat, providing flood protection for the entire New York Harbor. Opportunities exist for continued partnership with philanthropy to continue studying the technical feasibility of this approach along with related hydrologic modeling."

06/04/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-065.cfm,Obama Administration Announces Mayors Challenge to End Veteran Homelessness,"WASHINGTON - First Lady Michelle Obama, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) announced today the creation of the Mayors Challenge to End Veteran Homelessness during an event at the White House. More than 75 mayors and county and state officials across the country pledged they are committed to ending veterans homelessness in their communities by 2015 using the power of federal, local, and non-profit resources.
The Obama Administration has already reduced veterans homelessness by 24 percent since 2010 and ending veterans homelessness by the end of 2015 is within reach, but we must continue to accelerate our progress to reach the ultimate goal. The successes of ending chronic homelessness among Veterans in Salt Lake City and Phoenix have raised the profile of ending Veteran homelessness and prove that with buy-in from local officials and community partners, ending Veteran homelessness is an achievable goal.
""When you serve our nation in the bravest of ways, you should not have to wonder where you will lay your head at night. The Administration and communities across the country have taken bold action to use existing resources to create permanent supportive housing and ensure the targeting of the most vulnerable people."" said Shaun Donovan, Secretary, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. ""We know the size of the problem, we know the most effective and successful programs to get Veterans into permanent housing and Congress has given us the resources we need.""
""We're on our way to ending Veterans homelessness by the end of 2015, but we can't do it alone,"" said Acting Secretary of Veterans Affairs Sloan Gibson. ""It's a challenge that requires close collaboration among Federal, State, local governments, and community groups. We've proven we can reduce Veterans homelessness--now it's time to end it.""
""With Opening Doors, the first-ever federal strategic plan to prevent and end homelessness, this Administration made ending Veteran homelessness a national priority. The progress we've made has put this goal in close reach,"" said Laura Zeilinger, Executive Director, U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness. ""Now is the time to act with greater urgency and resolve. We call on every mayor and local leader to convene community partners, focus efforts on outcomes and instill relentless accountability to deliver on this commitment for every single one of our Veterans.""
To aid the mayors in pursuit of the goal of ending homelessness among veterans, the federal government has provided resources and enforced programs to strengthen our country's homeless assistance programs. These resources and reforms, when implemented in local communities, can include:
Using a Housing First approach, which removes barriers to help veterans obtain permanent housing as quickly as possible, without unnecessary prerequisites; Prioritizing the most vulnerable veterans, especially those experiencing chronic homelessness, for permanent supportive housing opportunities, including those created through the HUD-VASH program which offers vital housing assistance in the form of a rental voucher to help house approximately 10,000 veterans; Coordinating outreach efforts to identify and engage every veteran experiencing homelessness and focus outreach efforts on achieving housing outcomes; Targeting rapid rehousing interventions, including those made possible through the Department of Veterans Affairs' Supportive Services for Veteran Families program, toward veterans who need shorter-term rental subsidies and services in order to be reintegrated back into our communities; Leveraging housing and services resources that can help veterans who are ineligible for some of the VA's programs get into stable housing; Increasing early detection and access to preventive services so at-risk veterans remain stably housed; and Closely monitoring progress toward the goal, including the success of programs achieving permanent housing outcomes.

06/05/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-069.cfm,HUD Kicks Off National Homeownership Month,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) this week kicked off National Homeownership Month by recognizing the critical role owning a home plays in communities across America. ""Preserving the Dream"" is the theme of this month-long recognition and it reinforces the Obama Administration's work to build a more durable and fair housing finance system that promotes the American Dream of homeownership while preventing the unsustainable forms of home purchase that fueled the recent housing crisis.
When President Obama took office in 2009, the nation's housing market was in free-fall, leaving many families trapped and anxious about their mortgages. Today, the housing market is in recovery as homeowner equity is more than $10 trillion, foreclosure starts are at their lowest levels since 2005, and American families are on pace to purchase more than five million homes this year.
""Homeownership Month is a time to reaffirm the important role that 'home' plays for our families and the neighborhoods where they live,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""Owning a home has historically been the principal vehicle for Americans to build equity, start businesses, put kids through college, and retire with comfort and dignity. After all we've been through, we must stand by an institution that has helped build our nation's middle class.""
Responsible and sustainable homeownership is part of a number of measures the Obama Administration is promoting to build ladders of opportunity for middle class American families. Others include:
Seeking an increase in the minimum wage to make certain no person who works full-time lives in poverty; Enhancing training programs to help Americans get the skills to get jobs in the 21st century economy; and Promoting increased investment in the nation's aging infrastructure while stimulating job growth and allowing working families to improve their living conditions.
• Seeking an increase in the minimum wage to make certain no person who works full-time lives in poverty;
• Enhancing training programs to help Americans get the skills to get jobs in the 21st century economy; and
• Promoting increased investment in the nation's aging infrastructure while stimulating job growth and allowing working families to improve their living conditions.
HUD is also taking concrete steps to increase access to mortgage credit. This spring, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) issued its ""Blueprint for Access"", outlining the additional steps the agency is taking to expand access to credit for underserved borrowers. These steps include enhancing FHA's quality assurance processes and encouraging a broader use of housing counseling through the Homeowners Armed with Knowledge (HAWK) program. By clarifying quality assurance policies, FHA seeks to encourage lenders to make loans to a broader range of qualified, underserved borrowers. Under the HAWK pilot program, homebuyers who commit to housing counseling will qualify for tangible savings on their FHA-insured loans. The average buyer would save approximately $325 a year - or nearly $10,000 over the life of their loan. By completing HUD-approved housing counseling provided through independent nonprofit organizations, people will be given the tools they need to understand the rights and responsibilities of homeownership.
The third step of preserving homeownership as a key aspect to the ""American Dream"" is securing it for generations to come. As part of the historic $25 billion National Mortgage Servicing Settlement announced last year, the Administration and 49 state Attorneys General negotiated with the nation's largest mortgage servicers to address loan servicing and foreclosure abuses. The agreement provides substantial financial relief to homeowners and establishes significant new homeowner protections for the future.
Along with these steps, the Administration supports Congressional efforts to bring both responsibility and opportunity back to the market through the Housing Finance Reform and Taxpayer Protection Act of 2014 passed through the Senate Banking Committee in May 2013. Under the current structure, low wealth families and minority communities are not getting mortgages while taxpayers remain on the hook for potential losses in the housing market. This bill represents an important step forward in helping families who are ready to buy a home."
06/09/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-068.cfm,HUD Reaches Fair Housing Settlement with Seattle Apartment Complex Developers,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has reached an agreement with the owner, builder, architect and manager of a Seattle apartment complex, resolving allegations that they discriminated against persons with disabilities by failing to design and construct the 56-unit complex in a way that meets the accessibility requirements of the Fair Housing Act.
The Fair Housing Act requires that multifamily dwellings constructed for first occupancy after March 13, 1991 contain accessible features for persons with disabilities. The requirements include accessible common areas, bathrooms, kitchens, and doors, and environmental controls that can be reached by persons who use wheelchairs.
""We are pleased to have reached an agreement that will provide accessible housing for persons with disabilities,"" said Dave Ziaya, HUD's Acting Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""The design and construction requirements have been the law for more than two decades and HUD will continue to do all it can to ensure that architects and developers meet their legal obligations to comply.""
The agreement settles a HUD Secretary-initiated complaint, which alleged that the owner and builder of the three-building complex, Centro LLC; its management company, Calhoun Property Management; and the architect, ECCO Design, designed and constructed units that do not comply with the Fair Housing Act's design and construction requirements.
Specifically, an August 2013 HUD inspection of ""Centro"" found that its units, referred to as ""apodments,"" were inaccessible to persons with disabilities. For example, the project has walkways that are too steep; outlets and thermostatic controls that are too high to be reached by individuals using wheelchairs; doors with inaccessible thresholds; and bathrooms that do not contain enough space for people using wheelchairs. HUD's inspection also found that the complex has mailboxes that are too high to be reached by individuals using wheelchairs, and a common laundry room that is too narrow for wheelchair access.
Under the terms of the agreement, the owner, builder and architectural firm will make modifications to the project's public and common use areas and a unit to enhance accessibility. In addition, the owner, builder, and architectural firm agreed to retain the services of an accessibility consultant to conduct onsite inspections of interiors of covered units in all their other recently constructed projects and to make all recommended accessibility retrofits. The builder, architect, and other individuals responsible for accessible design features at the property will also attend Fair Housing Act design and construction training.
HUD has information available online to help architects and builders comply with the design and construction requirements.

Riverside Apartments is a former HUD subsidized, low-income public housing complex.
""These agreements will help ensure that former public housing residents in Ansonia and the surrounding area, including minority households and families with children, have access to much needed affordable housing,"" said Dave Ziaya, HUD's Acting Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will continue to work with housing authorities and local governments to create greater housing opportunities for low-income individuals and families.""
In June 2012, AHA received an approval letter from HUD to demolish the aging complex. HUD approved the demolition on condition that the housing authority would rebuild 48 units and that residents would have the right to return following redevelopment. However, AHA has since refused to rebuild the units.
The agreements settle two complaints that were filed with HUD by a former resident of Riverside who was relocated when the housing authority demolished five buildings on the property. The former resident alleged that most of the displaced residents were African-Americans, Hispanics, and families with children. The specific complaint against the housing authority alleged that it discriminated when it demolished the buildings and then reneged on its commitment to rebuild 48 units on the same site. The complaint against the city alleged that the former mayor publicly opposed the redevelopment of the property and interfered with plans to rebuild units on the site. This was alleged to violate The Fair Housing Act, which makes it unlawful to discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, or familial status, and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin in programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance.
Under the terms of agreement one and agreement two, the housing authority will complete construction of the first replacement unit within three years. The city will make an official statement of support for the redevelopment of the property and appoint a building committee to oversee the redevelopment effort. City and housing authority staff and board members will also receive fair housing training.
Persons who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed at www.hud.gov/fairhousing or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, which can be accessed through Apple devices, such as the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch."
06/10/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-066.cfm,HUD and Englewood Housing Authority Settlement Creates Housing Opportunities for Non-Elderly People with Disabilities,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has entered into a Voluntary Compliance Agreement with the Englewood Housing Authority (EHA) in Englewood, CO, settling allegations that EHA violated the Fair Housing Act when it implemented a point system at Orchard Place Apartments that effectively denied housing to applicants with disabilities unless they were elderly.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in the sale or rental of a dwelling on the basis of disability. In addition, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.
The agreement is the result of a HUD review which found that EHA imposed a policy that discriminated against Orchard Place non-elderly families with disabilities by implementing a preference point system effectively excludedfamilies with disabilities who were not elderly from living at Orchard Place even though the complex was designated as a ""mixed population development,"" serving seniors over age 62 and individuals with disabilities on an equal basis.
During its review, HUD found that EHA imposed a preference point system that gave points to disabled applicants based on age. Specifically, HUD found that the housing authority assigned qualified elderly families with disabilities 100 preference points, while equally qualified non-elderly families with disabilities were assigned 80 points. HUD further determined that the housing authority, in July 2011, implemented a similar point system that gave elderly families with disabilities 20 points; elderly families 10 points; and non-elderly families with disabilities 10 points. The effect of both systems was that applicant families with elderly disabled members were uniformly placed on the waiting list in front of families with non-elderly disabled members who had applied years earlier.
Under the terms of the agreement, the Englewood Housing Authority will eliminate the preference point system and reorder its waiting list to place applicants on a first-come, first-served basis. In addition, the housing authority agreed to undertake outreach activities to underserved populations, comply with additional oversight from HUD, and provide fair housing training for its employees.
""Federal law requires that properties designated as mixed housing serve individuals with disabilities equally, regardless of age,"" said Dave Ziaya, HUD's Acting Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""This agreement will help ensure that persons with disabilities will have access to housing opportunities at Englewood.""
If you have been trying to buy or rent a home or apartment and you believe your civil rights have been violated you can report it online at www.hud.gov/fairhousing, call (800) 669-9777 or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, which can be accessed through Apple devices, such as the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch."
06/12/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-070.cfm,HUD and HHS Announce Successful Test to Match Housing and Health Data to Better Understand the Needs of HUD-Assisted Households,"WASHINGTON - In a ground-breaking cross-agency collaboration, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) produced the first-ever dataset of HUD-assisted households that includes Medicare and Medicaid claims data. Despite the potential usefulness of combining administrative data across agencies, such projects are rare and very difficult to bring to fruition. HUD and HHS looked specifically at data on people aged 65 and older. Although the data do not describe individuals, they can be used to study trends.
HUD and HHS today are releasing a report on this exploratory project, Picture of Housing and Health: Medicare and Medicaid Use Among Older Adults in HUD-Assisted Housing (http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/2014/HUDpic.pdf). The study was conducted by the Lewin Group for HHS's Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation.
""More than 1.6 million low-income senior citizens live in subsidized housing,"" said Katherine M. O'Regan, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research. ""By combining two important data sources, we can improve our response to their needs and potentially reduce public costs in the process.""
In the 12 jurisdictions studied, up to 93 percent of HUD-assisted households appeared in both datasets. Approximately 68 percent of HUD-assisted Medicare beneficiaries were enrolled in both Medicare and Medicaid and about 90 percent of Medicare beneficiaries had Part D (drug) coverage, with most receiving subsidies through the Low Income Subsidy Program. In addition, the report finds that HUD-assisted older adult households have more chronic conditions and higher Medicare spending than unassisted older adult households in their areas.
These findings underscore the critical role that HUD plays in providing housing to some of the most vulnerable Americans. While these data analyses demonstrate feasibility, they are exploratory and they are not based on a representative sample.
The cross-agency data matching project is motivated by the urgent need for evidence to guide policy development for the growing population of low-income senior households. By 2030, one in every five Americans will be over age 65, and today's seniors have lower incomes than their predecessors. These households face the dual challenges of finding affordable housing and access to services that support them to live independently.
Supporting independent living not only enhances well-being, it may also decrease health care costs by safeguarding the health and safety of independently living seniors and preventing unnecessary transfers to nursing homes, trips to hospital emergency departments and frequent hospitalizations. The data matching reported on in Picture of Housing and Health is just one of several projects jointly undertaken by HUD and HHS in this area; related projects include designing a demonstration to investigate the role of services supporting older adults living in developments supported by HUD's Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly Program."
06/13/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-071.cfm,HUD Announces $70 Million Available for Indian Tribes and Alaska Native Villages to Improve Housing and Address Mold Removal,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced today $70 million in funding available during Fiscal Year 2014 to tribal communities across the nation to improve housing conditions and stimulate community development for low and moderate income families. The grants are available through HUD's Indian Community Development Block Grant (ICDBG) Program for a wide variety of community development and affordable housing activities. Read HUD's ICDBG Notice of Funding Availability (www.grants.gov/search-grants.html?agencies%3DHUD%7CDepartment%20of%20Housing%20and%20Urban%20Development) (NOFA).
The purpose of the ICDBG program is to develop viable Indian and Alaska Native communities, including decent housing, suitable living environments, and economic opportunities. Recipients can use the funding to support rehabbing or building new housing or to buy land for housing. They can use it toward infrastructure such as roads, water and sewer facilities. Recipients can also spur economic development including commercial and industrial projects. This has included community and health centers, energy conservation projects, or new businesses such as shopping centers, manufacturing plants, restaurants, convenience stores and gas stations.
""Housing and infrastructure needs in Indian Country are severe and widespread, and far exceed what has been provided to tribes and their designated housing entities. This funding will go directly to the Native American and Alaska Native communities that are working hard every day to improve housing for the families who need it most,"" said Rodger Boyd, HUD Deputy Assistant Secretary, Office of Native American Programs. ""HUD invests in people and neighborhoods across the country that promote development at the local level by those local leaders who know their communities best. This year we are committed to not only expanding housing opportunities but also helping to ensure healthier environments for those affected by mold.""
Approximately $56,200,000 is available for all ICDBG-eligible activities. This year, approximately $10,000,000 is set aside for grants for mold remediation and prevention in and on housing units owned or operated by tribes and tribally designated housing entities. About $3,960,000 will be retained to fund Imminent Threat grants to alleviate or remove threats to health or safety that require an immediate solution. The deadline to apply is July 29, 2014 (CFDA Number 14.862.)
The ICDBG program was established in 1977 to help Indian tribes and Alaska Native villages to meet their community development needs. Federally recognized Indian tribes, bands, groups or nations (including Alaska Indian, Aleuts and Eskimos,) Alaska Native villages, and eligible tribal organizations compete for this funding.
HUD administers six programs that are specifically targeted to American Indian, Alaska Native, or native Hawaiian individuals and families, and federally recognized tribal governments. In Fiscal Year 2014, HUD received more than $736 million to fund programs to support housing and development initiatives in American Indian, Alaska Native, and native Hawaiian communities. Through innovative programming, American Indian and Alaska Native tribal governments have created sustainable and community-driven solutions to their housing and community development challenges."
06/13/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-072.cfm,Nation's Public Housing Authorities Join HUD's Father's Day Initiative,"WASHINGTON - For the fourth consecutive year, Father's Day is attracting hundreds of communities across the country to participate in the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Reconnecting Families and Dad's Program, hosting free events to support dads living in public housingto stay connected with their children. This year, over 400 local public housing agencies are hosting events this Saturday and throughout the month to celebrate fatherhood and family. See which housing authorities are hosting events in your area.
""All across America, housing authorities and their surrounding communities are coming together to host activities that will bring fathers and their children closer together,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan, a father of two. ""Kids who have involved fathers in their lives grow up to be happier, healthier and better prepared to succeed in life. These events will connect dads with the resources they need to help them be the best fathers they can be.""
Local housing authorities will offer activities for fathers and their children who live in public housing or the surrounding community. The events have a two-fold purpose: offering activities for fathers and their children and to connect these men to economic development resources.
The local offices of federal agencies, such as the U.S. Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, Agriculture, Education and Justice, will offer on-site information and servicesat some of the events. Local authorities have partnered with organizations, such as the Boys & Girls Club of America, and the National Fatherhood Initiative (NFI) (www.fatherhood.org/Page.aspx?pid=192), to host events that celebrate fatherhood. Created in 1994, NFI aims to raise awareness about the importance of having fathers present in their children's life.
HUD's Father's Day initiative is part of a larger Obama Administration effort to promote responsible fatherhood. The National Conversation on Responsible Fatherhood and Strong Communities (www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ofbnp/policy/fatherhood) focuses on fatherhood and at-risk youth - a priority for the White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships.
When addressing the importance of fathers, President Obama once said at a Father's Day event (www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-a-fathers-day-event), ""Our children don't need us to be superheroes. They don't need us to be perfect. They do need us to be present. They need us to show up and give it our best shot, no matter what else is going on in our lives. They need us to show them – not just with words, but with deeds - that they, those kids, are always our first priority.""
According to U.S. Census data, 24 million American children live in a home without a father. NFI has also found that children in fatherless homes are five times more likely to live below the poverty line. Furthermore, these children are more likely to drop out of school or be incarcerated.
Modeled after a 2010 New York City Housing campaign and following President Obama's lead in starting a national discussion on responsible fatherhood, the initiative aims to strengthen the bond between children and their fathers, who are often absent from the lives of their children who live in public housing."
06/13/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-074.cfm,Obama Administration Releases May Housing Scorecard,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of the Treasury today released the May edition of the Obama Administration's Housing Scorecard - a comprehensive report on the nation's housing market. The latest data show progress among key indicators, including growing equity and a rebound in the sale of new and existing homes. While this scorecard notes positive overall trends in the housing market, officials caution that the harsh winter slowed growth as the economy recovers from the Great Recession. The full Housing Scorecard is available online at www.hud.gov/scorecard.
""May's Housing Scorecard shows that the housing market recovery is picking up after the harsh winter months,"" said HUD Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research Katherine O'Regan. ""More homeowners have positive equity, foreclosures continue their downward trend, and sales of new and existing homes are rebounding. While these are all good signs, it's clear that we must remain committed to helping homeowners as they recover from the worst housing recession since the Great Depression.""
""The standards set by the Making Home Affordable program have significantly changed the mortgage servicing industry,"" said Treasury Acting Assistant Secretary Tim Bowler. ""Treasury is committed to holding servicers accountable to these standards, and as a result has seen continued improvement by the largest servicers.""
The May Housing Scorecard features key data on the health of the housing market and the impact of the Administration's foreclosure prevention programs, including:
Homeowners' equity shows another strong gain. According to the Federal Reserve, homeowners' equity was up nearly $795 billion in the first quarter of 2014, reaching more than $10.8 trillion, the highest level since the second quarter of 2007.Homeowners' equity has risen sharply since the beginning of 2012, with equity up 73 percent, or nearly $4.6 trillion through the first quarter of 2014.The change in equity since April 1, 2009 now stands at more than $4.7 trillion. In the first quarter of 2014, more than 300,000 borrowers returned to a position of positive equity in their homes. According to CoreLogic, the number of underwater borrowers (those who owe more on their mortgage than the value of their home) has fallen 48 percent--from 12.108 million to 6.284 million--lifting more than 5.8 million homeowners above water from the beginning of 2012 through the 1st quarter of 2014. Approximately 12.7 percent of residential properties with a mortgage are still underwater, however. Foreclosure starts continue their downward trend. Lenders started the public foreclosure process on 49,240 U.S. properties in May, down 10 percent from the previous month and down 32 percent from one year ago to the lowest level since December 2005—a 101-month low (although foreclosure starts were up from a year ago in 12 states). (Source: Realty Trac) Purchases of new homes rebounded in April after declining for four out of the previous five months. New home sales were up 6.4 percent to 433,000 (SAAR) in April, following a 407,000 pace in March, but were down 4.2 percent from one year ago. (Source:HUD and Census Bureau). Sales of previously owned (existing) homes rose in April for the first time this year. The National Association of Realtors® (NAR) reported that existing homes—including single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums, and cooperatives—sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) of 4.65 million in April, up 1.3 percent from March but still 6.8 percent below the 4.99 million pace a year-earlier. The weakness in sales reflects low inventory, strict bank lending standards, fewer distressed properties on the market, and less favorable housing affordability. The Administration's foreclosure mitigation programs continue to provide relief for millions of homeowners as the recovery from the housing crisis continues. In all, more than 8.3 million mortgage modification and other forms of mortgage assistance arrangements were completed between April 2009 and the end of April 2014. More than 2.0 million homeowner assistance actions have taken place through the Making Home Affordable Program, including nearly 1.4 million permanent modifications through the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP), while the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) has offered 2.3 million loss mitigation and early delinquency interventions through April. The Administration's programs continue to encourage improved standards and processes in the industry, with HOPE Now lenders offering families and individuals more than 4.0 million proprietary modifications through March (data are reported with a 2-month lag).

06/17/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-075.cfm,HUD and Census Bureau Announce New Residential Construction Activity in May,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Census Bureau today announced the following new residential construction statistics for May 2014:
BUILDING PERMITS
Privately owned housing units authorized by building permits in May were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 991,000. This is 6.4 percent (±0.8%) below the revised April rate of 1,059,000, and is 1.9 percent (±1.4%) below the May 2013 estimate of 1,010,000. Single-family authorizations in May were at a rate of 619,000; this is 3.7 percent (±1.2%)* above the revised April figure of 597,000. Authorizations of units in buildings with five units or more were at a rate of 347,000 in May.
HOUSING STARTS
Privately owned housing starts in May were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,001,000. This is 6.5 percent (±10.2%)* below the revised April estimate of 1,071,000, but is 9.4 percent (±11.0%)* above the May 2013 rate of 915,000. Single-family housing starts in May were at a rate of 625,000; this is 5.9 percent (±12.7%)* below the revised April figure of 664,000.

EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take two months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, 4 months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2%) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90-percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised about three percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found on our web site listed above.
* 90% confidence interval includes zero. The Census Bureau does not have sufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero.

06/18/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-076.cfm,HUD Releases Progress Report On Sandy Rebuilding Strategy,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Sandy Program Management Office (PMO) today issued its first report tracking progress on the Sandy Rebuilding Strategy. The report is now available online.
""Following the storm, the Obama Administration committed to helping the Sandy region recover and rebuild in a way that prepares it for future storms. While this report shows we are following through on this commitment, we also recognize that many families and business are still on the road to recovery and delays in connecting them to the services and support they need are often too long,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""Although more work needs to be done, HUD and the federal government will continue coordinating with local officials until the region has recovered and we meet all the goals of the Sandy Rebuilding Strategy.""
The Rebuilding Strategy, released by the Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force in August 2013, includes a long-term plan that guides Sandy Supplemental spending, drives regional coordination, and makes communities more resilient to future disasters. Today's report tracks progress on seven goals that are important to the long-term rebuilding of the region in the most economically efficient, ecologically robust and innovative ways possible.
These goals are:
Promoting Resilient Rebuilding through Innovative Ideas and a Thorough Understanding of Current and Future Risk Ensuring a Regionally Coordinated, Resilient Approach to Infrastructure Investment Restoring and Strengthening Homes and Providing Families with Safe, Affordable Housing Options Supporting Small Businesses and Revitalizing Local Economies Addressing Insurance Challenges, Understanding, and Affordability Building State and Local Capacity to Plan for and Implement Long-Term Recovery and Rebuilding Improving Data Sharing Between Federal, State, and Local Officials
• Promoting Resilient Rebuilding through Innovative Ideas and a Thorough Understanding of Current and Future Risk
• Ensuring a Regionally Coordinated, Resilient Approach to Infrastructure Investment
• Restoring and Strengthening Homes and Providing Families with Safe, Affordable Housing Options
• Supporting Small Businesses and Revitalizing Local Economies
• Addressing Insurance Challenges, Understanding, and Affordability
• Building State and Local Capacity to Plan for and Implement Long-Term Recovery and Rebuilding
• Improving Data Sharing Between Federal, State, and Local Officials
In total, the Rebuilding Strategy identified 69 specific recommendations across these broad goals as well as specific agencies to lead the implementation of each of them. Since the publication of the Rebuilding Strategy, the Obama Administration has continued working across departments to move the recommendations forward and deliver on their commitments to the region."
06/19/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-077.cfm,HUD Provides Additional Funds for Nearly 900 Local Homeless Programs Across the Country,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Shaun Donovan today announced a second round of grants totaling $140 million to nearly 900 local homeless assistance programs across the country (see attached chart). Provided through HUD's Continuum of Care Program, the funding announced today will ensure additional permanent and transitional housing renewal projects are able to continue operating in the coming year, providing critically needed housing and support services to those persons and families experiencing homelessness.
Today's grant announcement includes 436 new local projects aimed at providing permanent supportive housing for persons experiencing chronic homelessness through a Housing First approach and to ""rapidly re-house"" families with children that are living on the street or in emergency shelters. View a complete list of all the state and local homeless projects awarded funding (https://www.onecpd.info/onecpd/assets/File/2013-all-coc-grants-final-announcement.pdf).
""Communities all across the country are changing their approach to reducing homelessness and now is not the time to retreat from doing what we know works,"" said Donovan. ""Investing in proven strategies such as 'Rapid Re-housing' and 'Housing First' help to break the cycle of homelessness as we've known it in these communities.""
This year, local planning agencies called 'Continuums of Care' were asked to make strategic and hard decisions in order to implement a required five percent cut as a result of sequestration. While HUD was able to fund all eligible new permanent housing projects requested, the Department was only able to fund permanent housing and transitional housing renewal projects requested in this second round of grants (Tier 2). Despite these cuts and the tough budgetary decisions they forced, most local planners chose to reallocate funds from lower priorities in order to create projects following best-practice models that serve those homeless persons most in need and to help the community achieve the goal of ending homelessness.
Earlier this year, HUD awarded $1.6 billion in the first round of funding to more than 7,100 existing local homeless programs operating across the U.S. That funding ensured that the local projects communities deemed most essential would remain operating in the coming year, providing critically needed housing and support services to those persons and families experiencing homelessness.
Donovan added, ""During this tough budget climate, ending homelessness requires a continued bipartisan commitment from Congress. The grantees receiving funds today will join the thousands of local programs that are already on the front lines ending homelessness as we know it.""
HUD recently announced its 2013 estimate of the number of homeless persons in America. Approximately 3,000 cities and counties reported 610,000 homeless persons on a single night in January of 2013, down 6.1 percent since 2010. During the same time, HUD found significant declines among the long-term or chronic homeless population (15.7 percent) and veterans experiencing homelessness (24.2 percent).
In 2010, President Obama and 19 federal agencies and offices that form the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH) launched the nation's first comprehensive strategy to prevent and end homelessness. Opening Doors: Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness (www.usich.gov/opening_doors/) puts the country on a path to end veterans and chronic homelessness by 2015 and to ending homelessness among children, family, and youth by 2020."
06/19/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-078.cfm,FHA Announces New Guidance Prohibiting Deceptive Marketing and Advertising Practices in Reverse Mortgage Program,"WASHINGTON - The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) published a Mortgagee Letter today reminding lenders participating in the agency's Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) Program to make certain senior borrowers are fully informed of all their options when applying for reverse mortgages. FHA's Mortgagee Letter also reinforces the agency's prohibition against misleading or deceptive advertising and that this prohibition extends to misleading or deceptive descriptions of the HECM program.
FHA's guidance is intended to protect HECM borrowers from misleading advertising and presentations that appear to limit their options rather than informing them of the full range of available HECM offerings.
""Senior borrowers deserve freedom of choice when considering whether a reverse mortgage is appropriate for them,"" said FHA Commissioner Carol Galante. ""This guidance is intended to make sure lenders know we're keeping a watchful eye on their marketing and advertising practices that might steer borrowers toward reverse mortgage options that limit their available choices.""
FHA-approved lenders are required to explain in clear, consistent language all requirements and features of the HECM program and may not mislead or otherwise cause a senior borrower to believe that the HECM product contains any features or limitations that are inconsistent with FHA's requirements. For example, the mortgagee must explain:
FHA insures fixed interest rate mortgages, as well as annual and monthly adjustable interest rate mortgages; The borrower has the ability to change the method of payment under the reverse mortgage ARM products at any time provided funds are available; Fixed interest rate mortgages are limited to the Single Disbursement Lump Sum payment option where there is a one-time draw at loan closing and no future draws post loan closing; Adjustable interest rate mortgages provide for five, flexible payment options, and allow future draws; The amount of funds available to the mortgagor is currently determined by the age of the youngest mortgagor, and The disbursement of mortgage proceeds during the first twelve-month disbursement period is subject to an initial disbursement limit as determined by requirements set by the Secretary.
• FHA insures fixed interest rate mortgages, as well as annual and monthly adjustable interest rate mortgages;
• The borrower has the ability to change the method of payment under the reverse mortgage ARM products at any time provided funds are available;

Lenders are prohibited from using any misleading or misrepresentative advertising or marketing materials in connection with the HECM program or from making any statement or representation that could mislead a mortgagor as to his or her rights under a HECM. In addition, mortgagees may not state or imply that as a result of their approval to participate in FHA programs that any of their products have been endorsed by FHA or HUD. All advertisements or marketing materials used in connection with the HECM program must include a prominently displayed disclaimer that clearly informs the public that such materials are not from HUD or FHA and the document was not approved by the Department or Government Agency.

The Brotman employees allegedly steered white testers posing as rental applicants to neighborhoods they described as safer, while directing black testers to areas agents considered ""rough.""
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to discriminate in the terms, conditions, or privileges associated with the sale or rental of a dwelling on the basis of race, including steering potential renters or homebuyers to different neighborhoods.
""Testing remains one of our most effective tools for exposing unlawful housing discrimination,"" said Bryan Greene, HUD's Acting Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will continue to enforce the Fair Housing Act to ensure that no family has their housing options limited because of their race.""
The case came to HUD's attention when the National Fair Housing Alliance (NFHA), a national fair housing organization that receives HUD funds to combat housing discrimination, filed a complaint with HUD alleging that Brotman Enterprise was unlawfully denying housing opportunities to African American homeseekers. Specifically, NFHA alleged that agents from the company, based in Feasterville-Trevose, northeast of Philadelphia, steered black testers to one of its properties in a high-crime, less desirable neighborhood, while telling white testers about a different property in an area they considered to be safer.
Under the terms of the Conciliation Agreement, Brotman Enterprises, LLC, will pay the National Fair Housing Alliance $25,000 in damages, get fair housing training for all of its leasing agents and managers, and establish a non-discrimination rental policy.
Persons who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY).

06/25/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-082.cfm,HUD Announces Agreement with Utah-Based Credit Union Ensuring Borrowers Not Denied Mortgages Due to Maternity Leave,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that Utah-based Mountain America Credit Union, the second largest credit union in Utah and the 35th largest credit union in the United States, will pay $25,000 to settle allegations that the company discriminated against prospective borrowers on maternity leave.
Refusing to approve a mortgage loan or provide mortgage insurance because a woman is pregnant or on family leave violates the Fair Housing Act's prohibition against sex and familial status discrimination, which includes individuals who have or are expecting a child.
The Conciliation Agreement is the result of a complaint HUD initiated on behalf of the public interest after investigating the allegations of a married couple who claimed their mortgage loan application was wrongly denied because the wife was on maternity leave.
Mountain America claimed that its mortgage insurer's guidelines for calculating income for women on maternity leave allowed regular pay to be considered only if the women returned to work before the loan closed.
""The birth of a child, a joyous event for a family, should not become the basis for denying that family a home mortgage,"" said Bryan Greene, HUD's General Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will continue to enforce fair housing laws to ensure that no family is denied the opportunity to buy a home because of maternity, paternity, or pregnancy leave.""
Under the terms of the agreement, Mountain America will pay $10,000 to an affected borrower identified during HUD's investigation, and $15,000 to a qualified organization to help educate the public about fair lending requirements and obligations, including the rights of borrowers on maternity, paternity, pregnancy, or parental leave at the time of an application for a home mortgage loan. Mountain America will also adopt a parental leave policy consistent with the Fair Housing Act with regard to calculation and treatment of maternity, paternity, and pregnancy leave income, and identify when employment income may be used based upon the timing of a scheduled return to work date. Mountain America will conduct training on the new policy and its application for its employees. The married couple who brought the case to HUD's attention settled their complaint in 2013.

06/26/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-083.cfm,HUD Announces Settlement between Fair Housing Center and Hartford County Real Estate Company over Discriminatory Ads,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today a Conciliation Agreement between the Connecticut Fair Housing Center (CFHC) and respondents Lil-1 Associates, AllPoints Realty and realtor Lillian Polak. The real estate companies will pay more than $24,000 to settle allegations that they published discriminatory listings and advertisements for condominiums specifying that children were not permitted.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to refuse to sell or rent housing on thebasis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, disability, or familial status. This includes refusing to allow families with children under 18 unless the property qualifies as housing for older persons.
""Refusing to sell or rent housing to families with children is against the law unless the property meets the very specific requirements of housing for older persons,"" said Bryan Greene, HUD's General Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will continue to enforce the Fair Housing Act and ensure that real estate brokers and agents do not illegally limit the housing options of families because they have children.""
The agreement settles a complaint filed with HUD by CFHC, an organization that receives HUD funding to investigate housing discrimination, alleging that Lil-1, AllPoints and Polak placed internet advertisements and a listing in the Multiple Listing Service that specified that children were not permitted at the advertised condominiums in Plainville, CT. Respondents also allegedly verbally communicated the policy of prohibiting families with children to a CFHC tester posing as a potential buyer. The condo complex is not housing for older persons.
Under the terms of the agreement, the respondents will pay CFHC $24,375 in damages. AllPoints also agreed to ensure that its employees attend fair housing training, and to hold itself out as an equal opportunity housing provider in future advertisements. The company also agreed to inform any property owners seeking to list rentals or sales with limitations against families with children that doing so is a violation of the Fair Housing Act. Lil-1 Associates has ceased operations.

06/26/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-085.cfm,"FHA Partners with Treasury for New Efforts to Assist Struggling and Prospective Homeowners, Provide More Affordable Options for Renters","WASHINGTON - Federal Housing Administration (FHA) Commissioner Carol Galante and U.S. Department of Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew today announced Obama Administration efforts to continue helping struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure, increase access to affordable rental options and expand access to credit for borrowers. In remarks at the Making Home Affordable (MHA) Fifth Anniversary Summit, Secretary Jacob Lew specifically unveiled a new financing partnership between the Treasury Department and HUD aimed at supporting FHA's multifamily mortgage risk-sharing program. In addition, Secretary Lew announced an extension of the MHA program for at least one year and a new effort to help jumpstart the Private Label Securities (PLS) market. Before speaking at the Summit, Secretary Lew met with homeowners and housing counselors at the Greater Washington Urban League, a non-profit organization that provides direct services and advocacy to more than 65,000 individuals each year.
With the new HUD-Treasury partnership, the Federal Financing Bank (FFB) will use its authority to finance FHA-insured mortgages that support the construction and preservation of rental housing. The first partnership - announced today - with the New York City Housing Development Corporation will help restore affordable rental housing damaged by Superstorm Sandy in Far Rockaway, Queens.
""Families have been especially hard hit during the rental housing crisis. Demand is soaring and prices are climbing,"" said Carol Galante, Federal Housing Administration Commissioner and Assistant Secretary for Housing, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. ""To help the many hard working families who cannot find affordable rental housing, we are partnering with the Treasury Department, to broaden our efforts to create and preserve safe, decent and affordable rental housing by allowing more Housing Finance Agencies access to the capital they need to build or maintain affordable multifamily apartment buildings.""
""Families and neighborhoods across the country continue to recover from the financial crisis, and we must not lose our resolve to help them, even as the economy continues to expand,"" said Secretary Lew. ""From day one, the Obama Administration has worked to provide relief to struggling homeowners and stabilize hard-hit communities. Today's announcement continues that effort. These new actions will help provide more affordable options for renters, assist homeowners facing foreclosure or juggling bills to pay their mortgages and expand access to credit for prospective borrowers.""
In addition to the new HUD-Treasury partnership, Secretary Lew announced today that the Administration would be extending MHA at least until December 31, 2016, to allow the Administration to continue assisting homeowners facing foreclosure and those whose homes are underwater. To date, the MHA program has provided relief to homeowners across the country, including more than 1.3 million homeowners who have permanently modified their mortgages, saving a median of $540 a month in mortgage payments. The Treasury Department's housing assistance programs have also become a model for the broader housing sector, setting a new standard for the mortgage industry on how to restructure loans and help homeowners. More than 5 million homeowners have been helped by private lenders who have, in many cases, used a similar framework to the one created by MHA's Home Affordable Modification Program.
Finally, in an effort to help expand access to credit for qualified prospective homeowners, Secretary Lew announced a new Treasury-led effort to catalyze the PLS market.
Prior to the housing crisis, private label securities provided access to credit for many qualified Americans who did not meet Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs) and FHA eligibility requirements. Securitization allowed the risks associated with extending mortgage credit to be allocated among investors with different appetites for taking credit and interest rate risk.
Since the crisis, Treasury officials have been working with regulators to put in place reforms that address the flaws in the securitization and lending practices that played a role in the financial crisis. Nevertheless, many of the largest investors have not returned to the market, resulting in very little issuance and few mortgage financing options for borrowers aside from government-supported channels. To help determine what more can be done to encourage a well-functioning PLS market, the Treasury Department today is publishing a Request for Comment in the Federal Register and plans to host a series of upcoming meetings with investors and securitizers to further explore ways to increase private lending.
The New HUD-Treasury Partnership
Under the new partnership with the Treasury Department, the FFB will provide financing for multifamily loans insured under FHA's risk sharing programs. The new partnership between the Treasury Department and HUD will help create and preserve more decent rental housing by significantly reducing the interest rate for affordable multi-family apartment buildings compared to the cost of tax-exempt bonds under current market conditions.
The New York City Housing Development Corporation (NYC-HDC) has worked extensively with HUD/FHA Risk Sharing, Treasury's New Issue Bond Program, tax-exempt bonds, and other multifamily housing financing structures. HUD through FHA would provide mortgage insurance pursuant to a risk sharing agreement with NYC-HDC and the FFB would fund NYC-HDC mortgage loans for multifamily projects.
The FFB is authorized to fund any obligation that is fully guaranteed by another Federal agency. The Risk Sharing program meets this requirement because FFB would purchase certificates or securities evidencing undivided beneficial ownership interests in 100 percent HUD/FHA-insured mortgages and HUD/FHA would cover 100% of the outstanding principal balance plus 100% of accrued interest in the event of a mortgage claim."

HUD is awarding Choice Neighborhoods Initiative implementation grants to stakeholder groups in Columbus, Ohio; Norwalk, Connecticut; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and Pittsburgh Pennsylvania in order to begin the process of transforming, rehabilitating and preserving public housing and privately owned HUD-assisted housing.
As part of HUD's overall plan for revitalizing neighborhoods of concentrated poverty, Choice Neighborhoods funds are intended to transform distressed public and assisted housing into sustainable, mixed-income housing with connection to key assets and services and to support positive outcomes for families living in the development and in the neighborhood.
""HUD's Choice Neighborhoods Initiative supports local visions for how to transform high-poverty, distressed communities into neighborhoods of opportunity,"" said Donovan. ""By working together, with local and state partners we will show why neighborhoods should always be defined by their potential - not their problems. Together, we will work to ensure that no child's future is determined by their zip code and expand opportunity for all.""
HUD received 44 applications for implementation grants. The following applicants will receive a combined total of nearly $120 million in award from the FY13 competition funds (read a complete summary of each grant):
Building on the successes of HUD's HOPE VI Program, Choice Neighborhoods links housing improvements with a wide variety of public services and neighborhood improvements to create neighborhoods of opportunity.
HUD's Choice Neighborhoods Initiative is one of the signature programs of the White House Neighborhood Revitalization Initiative (www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/oua/initiatives/neighborhood-revitalization), which supports innovative and inclusive strategies that bring public and private partners together to help break the cycle of intergenerational poverty. It encourages collaboration between HUD and the Departments of Education, Justice, Treasury and Health and Human Services to support local solutions for sustainable, mixed-income neighborhoods with the affordable housing, safe streets and good schools all families need. Choice Neighborhoods also contributes to the President's Promise Zones initiative (https://www.onecpd.info/promise-zones), which will revitalize up to 20 of America's highest-poverty communities by creating jobs, attracting private investment, increasing economic activity, expanding educational opportunity, and reducing violent crime.
Congress approved the Choice Neighborhoods Initiative with the passage of HUD's Fiscal Year 2010 budget. Funding is provided through two separate programs - Implementation Grants and Planning Grants. In 2011, HUD awarded its first Choice Implementation grants for Chicago, Boston, New Orleans, San Francisco and Seattle, a combined $122.27 million investment to bring comprehensive neighborhood revitalization to blighted areas in these cities. With today's announcement, HUD has awarded more than $350 million in Choice Implementation Grants since 2011."

Our intention is to make it easier to do business with us, reduce compliance costs and ultimately increase access to credit. We look forward to receiving feedback from our partners so we can continue improving the way we work together.""
FHA is publishing two new sections of its developing Single-family Handbook:

• Doing Business with FHA - FHA Lenders and Mortgagees - This section outlines the requirements associated with FHA mortgagee approval, including eligibility requirements, application processes, operating requirements, post-approval changes, the recertification process, and processes for applying for supplemental mortgagee authorities.
Quality Control, Oversight and Compliance - This section outlines the ongoing lender and mortgagee responsibility to perform institution and loan-level quality control. Additionally, this section details the repercussions for failing to act in accordance with FHA requirements, including explanations of possible administrative actions and sanctions. It is intended that this clear guidance will assist lenders to better meet FHA standards and reduce compliance costs in the process.

The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to discriminate in the terms, conditions, or privileges associated with the sale or rental of a dwelling on the basis sex, including denying a mortgage loan or mortgage insurance because a woman is pregnant or on family leave.
The Conciliation Agreement resolves a complaint a married couple filed with HUD alleging that Greenlight Financial Services, now called GFS Capital Holdings, denied their application to refinance their home mortgage because the wife was on maternity leave. HUD's investigation found that Greenlight Financial Services also allegedly denied four other applicants who were on maternity leave, or delayed their applications until after the women returned to work.
""The fact that an applicant is on maternity leave alone is not a valid basis for denying or delaying a refinance loan,"" said Bryan Greene, HUD's General Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will continue to enforce fair housing laws to ensure that no otherwise qualified applicant is illegally denied the home financing they need only because they take maternity, paternity or parental leave.""
Under the terms of the agreement, Greenlight Financial Services will pay $20,000 to the couple that filed the complaint, and $7,000 to each of the other four applicants HUD identified during its investigation.

""After visiting Lyons and Evans last year, I promised HUD would remain committed to making sure the state has the resources they need to recover from unprecedented flooding and mudslides,"" said Donovan. ""This additional money will fund a local vision to rebuild homes and businesses, repair badly damaged roads and bridges, and spur economic development. HUD will continue working with officials in Colorado to rebuild more resilient and better prepared for future storms.""
""It has been almost ten months since the flood struck last fall, and our federal partners have provided extraordinary resources to help our state recover,"" said Governor John Hickenlooper. ""This third round of funding of CDBG-DR funds will help our communities grow stronger and more resilient as they recover over the long term. Families, businesses and local economies in disaster-impacted communities will never be made whole. But this funding will provide critical support for Colorado's future.""
""The September 2013 flood and destructive government shutdown left Colorado hobbled. Since then I have been proud to work collaboratively with the U.S. Department Housing and Urban Development to ensure Colorado communities have the resources they need to rebuild and protect Coloradans and businesses from future floods,"" U.S. Senator Mark Udall said. ""This latest allocation is welcome news for Colorado and underscores the critical role HUD has played and will continue to play in helping us to rebuild smarter and stronger.""
""We knew we'd have a long road to recovery, and we're making tremendous progress,"" Senator Michael Bennet said. ""These resources from HUD are particularly critical because they will us help continue to recover in a variety of ways, from repairing homes and businesses, to restoring local infrastructure, supporting the long term economic recovery of these communities, and mitigating future damage. We'll continue to work with HUD and other federal agencies along with the state to ensure every community has what it needs to recover during this long process.""
A minimum of 80 percent of the funds awarded will be targeted in Boulder, Weld, and Larimer Counties where approximately 2,800 homes incurred major or severe damage.
The Disaster Relief Appropriations Act of 2013, signed into law by President Obama on January 29th, included $16 billion in CDBG-DR funding. The legislation specifies these funds are to be used ""for necessary expenses related to disaster relief, long-term recovery, restoration of infrastructure and housing, and economic revitalization in the most impacted and distressed areas resulting from a major disaster.""
HUD's CDBG-DR grants are intended to confront housing, business and infrastructure needs beyond those addressed by other forms of public and private assistance. Using a combination of data from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Small Business Administration (SBA), HUD identified particular counties in Colorado with the greatest extent of damage to housing, businesses and infrastructure.
HUD will shortly publish a Notice that will regulate the use of the funds announced today. The State of Colorado will then finalize disaster 'action plans' describing how it intends to expend these funds to support disaster recovery and HUD will quickly review them."

""Since Illinois was struck by severe storms last year, HUD has worked closely with local officials to ensure they have the resources they need to help the hardest-hit communities recover,"" said Donovan. ""HUD will continue working with state and local leaders as they rebuild homes and businesses to be more resilient and better prepared for future storms.""
The Disaster Relief Appropriations Act of 2013, signed into law by President Obama on January 29th, included $16 billion in CDBG-DR funding. The legislation specifies these funds are to be used ""for necessary expenses related to disaster relief, long-term recovery, restoration of infrastructure and housing, and economic revitalization in the most impacted and distressed areas resulting from a major disaster.""
HUD's CDBG-DR grants are intended to confront housing, business and infrastructure needs beyond those addressed by other forms of public and private assistance. Using a combination of data from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Small Business Administration (SBA), HUD identified particular counties in Colorado with the greatest extent of damage to housing, businesses and infrastructure.
HUD will shortly publish a Notice that will regulate the use of the funds announced today. The grantees will then finalize disaster 'action plans' describing how they intend to expend these funds to support disaster recovery and HUD will quickly review them."

07/23/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-089.cfm,HUD and New Hampshire Landlords Settle Allegations of Discrimination Against Domestic Violence Victim,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today agreements with the owners and managers of two Berlin, New Hampshire properties, settling allegations that they engaged in housing discrimination when they refused to rent to a woman who was a victim of domestic violence.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to discriminate in the sale or rental of housing because of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, disability, or familial status.
""No woman should be denied housing based on her status as a domestic violence survivor,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD remains committed to ensuring and promoting fair housing opportunities for women and men alike.""
The agreement is the result of two complaints filed by a woman with HUD in December 2013. In the first complaint, the woman alleged that TKB Properties and the New England Family Housing Management Organization refused to renew her lease because of police visits responding to her domestic violence-related 911 calls. The second complaint arose when the woman was searching for another home after her lease was not renewed, alleging that landlord Michael Warren refused to rent her an apartment based on the previous domestic violence-related police visits.
Under the terms of agreement one and agreement two, the woman will receive $13,550 from the three respondents. The landlords have agreed to participate in fair housing training and undergo monitoring by HUD. TKB Properties and New England Family Housing also will revise their policies and leases for all HUD-subsidized properties to comply with the Violence Against Women Act and HUD's regulations providing protection for victims of domestic violence in public and federally-funded housing.
The woman was represented by New Hampshire Legal Assistance, which receives funding through HUD's Fair Housing Initiatives Program to assist people who believe they have been victims of housing discrimination.
Persons who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed at www.hud.gov/fairhousing or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, which can be accessed through Apple devices, such as the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch."

Biography of Secretary Julián Castro
Julián Castro was sworn in as the 16th Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development on July 28, 2014. In this role, Castro oversees 8,000 employees and a budget of $46 billion, using a performance-driven approach to achieve the Department's mission of expanding opportunity for all Americans.
""Julián is a proven leader, a champion for safe, affordable housing and strong, sustainable neighborhoods,"" said President Barack Obama after Castro's confirmation. ""I know that together with the dedicated professionals at HUD, Julián will help build on the progress we've made battling back from the Great Recession - rebuilding our housing market, reducing homelessness among veterans, and connecting neighborhoods with good schools and good jobs that help our citizens succeed.""
As Secretary, Castro's focus is ensuring that HUD is a transparent, efficient and effective champion for the people it serves. Utilizing an evidence-based management style, he has charged the Department with one goal: giving every person, regardless of their station in life, new opportunities to thrive.
Before HUD, Castro served as Mayor of the City of San Antonio. During his tenure, he became known as a national leader in urban development. In 2010, the City launched the ""Decade of Downtown"", an initiative to spark investment in San Antonio's center city and older neighborhoods. This effort has attracted $350 million in private sector investment, which will produce more than 2400 housing units by the end of 2014. In addition, San Antonio's East Side is the only neighborhood in America that has received funding to implement major projects under three key Obama Administration revitalization initiatives: Choice Neighborhoods, Promise Neighborhoods and the Byrne Criminal Justice Program.
In March 2010, Castro was named to the World Economic Forum's list of Young Global Leaders. Later that year, Time magazine placed him on its ""40 under 40"" list of rising stars in American politics.
Previously, Castro served as a member of the San Antonio City Council. He is also an attorney and worked at Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld before starting his own practice.
Secretary Castro received a B.A. from Stanford University in 1996, and a J.D. from Harvard Law School in 2000. He and his wife, Erica, have a daughter, Carina."
08/06/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-094.cfm,"HUD and VA Announce Vouchers to Help Nearly 1,000 Homeless Veterans Find Permanent Homes","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) today announced $7 million to 24 local public housing agencies across the country to help nearly 1,000 homeless Veterans find permanent housing. The supportive housing assistance announced today is provided through the HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) Program which combines rental assistance from HUD with case management and clinical services provided by VA (see chart below).
Later this year, HUD anticipates awarding approximately 10,000 new HUD-VASH vouchers to build upon significant progress toward ending Veteran homelessness. Since 2008, more than 59,000 vouchers have been awarded and 43,371 formerly homeless Veterans are currently in homes of their own because of HUD-VASH. Rental assistance and support services provided through HUD-VASH are a critical resource for local communities in ending homelessness among our nation's Veterans.
""We have made great progress, reducing homelessness among Veterans by 24 percent in just three years,"" said HUD SecretaryJulián Castro. ""These vouchers will help communities build on these gains, providing targeted assistance to reach those in need. Ending homelessness is a top priority for me, and HUD looks forward to working with the Department of Veterans Affairs to ensure that every Veteran has a place to call home in the country they risked everything to protect.""
""VA, HUD and our federal, state and local partners should take pride in the progress made to reduce Veterans' homelessness by 24 percent since 2010, but so long as there remains a Veteran that lives on our streets, we have more work to do,"" said Carolyn M. Clancy, MD, Interim Under Secretary for Health. ""These HUD-VASH vouchers are a vital tool in our effort to provide our Veterans with the earned care and benefits that help them live productive, meaningful lives.""
HUD-VASH is a critical part of the Obama Administration's commitment to end Veteran homelessness by 2015. Opening Doors: Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness (http://usich.gov/opening_doors/) serves as a roadmap for how the federal government will work with state and local communities to confront the root causes of homelessness, especially among former servicemen and women.
As the former mayor of San Antonio, Secretary Castro was among the growing ranks of more than 180 mayors who joined the Mayors Challenge to End Veteran Homelessness by the end of 2015 by using federal, local, and nonprofit resources. Since 2010, the Obama Administration has reduced veteran homelessness by 24 percent. And while ending veteran homelessness by the end of 2015 is within reach, continued use of tools like HUD-VASH are central to reaching that goal.
In the HUD-VASH program, VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) work closely with homeless veterans before referring them to local housing agencies for these vouchers. Decisions are based on a variety of factors, most importantly the duration of the homelessness and the need for longer term, more intensive support in obtaining and maintaining permanent housing. The HUD-VASH program includes both the rental assistance the voucher provides and the comprehensive case management that VAMC staff offers.
Veterans participating in the HUD-VASH program rent privately owned housing and generally contribute no more than 30 percent of their income toward rent. VA offers eligible homeless Veterans clinical and supportive services through its medical centers across the U.S., Guam and Puerto Rico."
08/07/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-095.cfm,"Federal Report Highlights Five Years of Progress Providing Communities with Affordable Housing, Efficient Transportation and Economic Growth","WASHINGTON, D.C. - In celebration of the fifth anniversary of the Partnership for Sustainable Communities, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released ""Five Years of Learning from Communities and Coordinating Federal Investments,"" a report demonstrating how the three agencies are cooperating to help communities provide more housing choices, make transportation systems more efficient and reliable, and create vibrant neighborhoods that attract business development and jobs while protecting the environment.
""The Partnership for Sustainable Communities is about achieving one goal: expanding opportunity for American families,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""These targeted investments are bringing more affordable housing and transportation options, and more economic resilience to regions that were hard hit by the economic crisis. In partnership with local leaders, I am convinced that the investments our agencies have made will enhance the health and wealth of communities for decades to come.""
""The Partnership is helping us align our transportation investments with the goals of providing affordable housing and preserving the environment,"" said DOT Secretary Anthony Foxx. ""Together with HUD and EPA, we are making fundamental changes in how we work together to benefit all Americans and provide new Ladders of Opportunity for many.""
""Communities know better than anyone else what they need,"" said EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy. ""Through the Partnership for Sustainable Communities, we at the federal level are organizing ourselves to give communities tools to address economic and environmental challenges in the way that works best for them.""
Since 2009, the Partnership for Sustainable Communities has been working to ensure that HUD, DOT, EPA and other federal agency investments better serve communities that were hard hit by the economic recession. Through its efforts, more than $4 billion has been awarded to 1,000 communities in all 50 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico. In addition to funding, many communities have also received technical assistance to help plan economic development and leverage private and other public resources to maximize the Partnership's investments. For example:
Partnership-funded regional planning efforts in New York and New Jersey laid a strong foundation for recovery from Superstorm Sandy because communities in the region had already been collaborating on development issues. Partnership grants helped Memphis, Tennessee create a master plan for redeveloping the area around its airport, as well as develop a plan to improve bike and pedestrian paths and spur revitalization in a midtown neighborhood. Partnership funding helped the Thunder Valley Community Development Corporation on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota develop a regional plan to define the community's future. It could be a model for other rural Native American communities as well.

The three agencies collaborate on reviewing and selecting applications for many grants and technical assistance opportunities, such as DOT's Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) Discretionary Grants, HUD's Community Challenge Grants, and EPA's Brownfields Area-Wide Planning Grants. This collaboration ensures that federal investments to maximize resources for communities.

08/12/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-096.cfm,HUD and Housing Authority of the City of Milwaukee Reach Agreement to Improve Job Opportunities for Low-Income Residents,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has reached a Voluntary Compliance Agreement with the Housing Authority of the City of Milwaukee (HACM), resolving HUD findings the housing authority failed to comply with Section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968. HACM agreed to change its hiring and contracting practices to increase hiring of public housing and other low-income residents, as well as contracting with businesses that employ low-income persons.
Section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 requires that training, employment and contracting opportunities generated by certain HUD financial assistance be, to the greatest extent feasible, directed to public housing residents and to other low-income persons (whose family income does not exceed 80% of the area median income) and to very low-income persons (whose family income does not exceed 50% of the area median income) in the community.
""With Section 3, HUD investments are more than brick and mortar. They form a pathway to opportunity and self-sufficiency,"" said HUD Assistant Secretary of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity Gustavo Velasquez.
""This voluntary agreement between the Department and the Housing Authority of the City of Milwaukee provides a ladder of opportunity for low-income people and for Section 3 businesses in Milwaukee,"" said HUD Midwest Regional Administrator Antonio R. Riley. ""The measure of this Agreement lies in the access that residents and small businesses now have to the employment and training possibilities being extended by the Housing Authority, and for that we are optimistic.""
""HACM and HUD worked together to develop this agreement as a more detailed roadmap to achieve Section3 goals,"" said HACM Secretary-Executive Director Tony Pérez. ""The Housing Authority and HUD share the mission to foster economic opportunities for low-income residents and contractors, and the VCA will be a valuable tool in guiding our collective efforts to achieve that mission. We thank all those who came together and gave of their time and knowledge in crafting this agreement.""
HACM's Section 3 initiative is part of a cadre of HACM programs that work to reduce the effects of poverty and improve quality of life for low-income residents. These programs include workforce development assistance to increase wages and self-sufficiency, neighborhood initiatives to improve educational and health outcomes, and a leading emerging business enterprise program that builds the capacity of minority- and women-owned businesses to compete in the public and private marketplaces.
The agreement is the result of a HUD limited compliance review of HACM following community complaints about a lack of local residents or people of color at the housing authority's Westlawn Redevelopment Project. From 2009 to 2012, HACM received more $230 million dollars in funding from HUD, including operating subsidies, capital funds, modernization funds, development funds and American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds. During the same period, HACM awarded more than $60 million in construction and other contracts as part of the Westlawn Redevelopment Project.
According to HUD's compliance review, no Westlawn residents and no residents from other HACM developments were hired to work on the Westlawn Project. The HUD review foundthat HACM was noncompliant with important Section 3 obligations, including that it did not provide employment and contracting opportunities to qualified HACM residents and Section 3 businesses, that HACM policies and procedures incorrectly exempted smaller contracts from the Section 3 contracting preferences, that HACM did not require contractors and subcontractors to post information about how to seek employment at the Westlawn Project site, and that HACM failed to notify HACM residents of training and employment opportunities related to the project.
Under the terms of the agreement, HACM commits to correct and revise its Section 3 Plan and seek public comment before submitting it to HUD for approval. HACM will identify businesses interested in contracting with the housing authority that will certify they are eligible for Section 3 contracting preferential consideration. HACM also will identify its public housing residents and others seeking employment who are entitled to a Section 3 hiring preference. HACM and its contractors and subcontractors will consider job seekers with Section 3 preferences when filling vacancies and will explain decisions not to hire them in writing. HACM will also expand training and outreach activities including the creation of a $50,000 Section 3 Fund to be used for training, outreach and other purposes related to Section 3.
HUD's national Section 3 Business Registry is a new resource for qualified Section 3 businesses - those that put a priority on hiring public housing or low-income residents. The registry allows these businesses to register their company so they can be alerted about new contracting opportunities. Local agencies can also search the database to find local Section 3 businesses. To learn more about HUD's Section 3 Business Registry, visit: www.hud.gov/sec3biz. To file a complaint against a direct recipient of HUD funding for violations of the Section 3 requirements, go to www.hud.gov/Section3."
08/12/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-097.cfm,HUD Releases July Housing Scorecard,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today released the July edition of the Obama Administration's Housing Scorecard—a comprehensive report on the nation's housing market. The latest data show progress among key indicators, including rebound in the sale of existing homes and the continuing downward trend of foreclosure starts and completions. This month's Housing Scorecard also features a spotlight on the Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington, PA-NJ-DE-MD Metropolitan Statistical Area (Philadelphia MSA). While this scorecard notes positive overall trends in the housing market, officials caution that more work needs to be done as the economy recovers from the Great Recession. The full Housing Scorecard is available online.
""The market indicators for the housing market recovery were mixed in July as foreclosure filings continue to improve, but home sales, particularly for new homes, showed unexpected weakness,"" said HUD Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research Katherine O'Regan. ""Home prices, while still increasing, are doing so at slower rates. Indications are that continued improvements in the economy, such as the July employment report which marked the sixth straight month that more than 200,000 jobs have been added, along with slowly easing mortgage credit, will keep the U.S. housing market on the path to recovery.""
The July Housing Scorecard features key data on the health of the housing market and the impact of the Administration's foreclosure prevention programs, including:
Sales of previously owned (existing) homes rose for the third consecutive month in June after a lackluster performance in the previous two quarters. The National Association of Realtors® (NAR) reported that existing homes—including single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums, and cooperatives—sold at a pace of 5.04 million (SAAR) in June, up 2.6 percent from May but remain 2.3 percent below the 5.16 million pace a year earlier. Sales are at their highest pace since October 2013 (5.13 million).

Sales are at their highest pace since October 2013 (5.13 million).
Foreclosure starts and completions continue their downward trend. Lenders started the public foreclosure process on 47,243 U.S. properties in June, down 4 percent from the previous month and down 18 percent from one year ago to the lowest level since November 2005—more than an 8½ year low. Lenders completed the foreclosure process (bank repossessions or REOs) on 26,889 U.S. properties in June, down 5 percent from the previous month and down 24 percent from one year ago to the lowest level since June 2007—a 7 year low. (Note however that foreclosure starts and completions were up from a year ago in about 15 states).

House prices appreciate in May while year-over-year gains continue to slow. The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) seasonally adjusted purchase-only house price index showed home values appreciated by 0.4 percent over the prior month and 5.5-percent over the previous year, marking the fifth straight month of more modest annual growth in home prices. The FHFA index shows that U.S. home values are on par with prices in mid-2005.The S&P/Case-Shiller 20-City Home Price Index (not seasonally adjusted) posted month-over-month returns for May of 1.1 percent and gains of 9.3 percent over the past 12 months. The Case-Shiller index shows annual rates of gain in home prices slowing over the last six months; home values are at September-2004 levels. (The Case-Shiller and FHFA price indices are released with a two-month lag.)

Sales of new homes fell in June and sales in May were revised sharply downward. New home sales declined 8.1 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) of 406,000 in June, following sales of 442,000 in May that were 12.3 percent lower than estimated last month. Sales were at their lowest level since March and down 11.5 percent from one year ago. The weakness in sales reflects strict bank lending standards, less favorable housing affordability, and low inventory. (Source: HUD and Census Bureau).

The Administration's foreclosure mitigation programs continue to provide relief for millions of homeowners as the recovery from the housing crisis continues. In all, more than 8.5 million mortgage modification and other forms of mortgage assistance arrangements were completed between April 2009 and the end of June 2014. Nearly 2.1 million homeowner assistance actions have taken place through the Making Home Affordable Program, including nearly 1.4 million permanent modifications through the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP), while the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) has offered more than 2.3 million loss mitigation and early delinquency interventions through June. The Administration's programs continue to encourage improved standards and processes in the industry, with HOPE Now lenders offering families and individuals more than 4.1 million proprietary modifications through May (HOPE Now data are reported with a 2-month lag).

This month's Housing Scorecard also features a regional spotlight on market strength in the Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington, PA-NJ-DE-MD Metropolitan Statistical Area (Philadelphia MSA).Like many areas across the country, the economic and housing market conditions in the Philadelphia area are improving, but the housing crisis and peak of foreclosures hit this area later than the rest of the country and the subsequent recovery has been progressing more slowly. The Administration's broad approach to stabilize the housing market has been provided help to homeowners throughout the Philadelphia MSA.
The housing market in Philadelphia MSA is showing important signs of improvement. As with similar areas along the East Coast, the initial downturn from the foreclosure crisis in the Philadelphia MSA was less severe than in some areas of the nation but the recovery from the crisis and subsequent recession has been slower. The share of mortgages at risk of foreclosure (those 90 or more days delinquent or in the foreclosure process) did not peak in Philadelphia until the beginning of 2013--three years later than for the nation--and at a much higher rate, although the share of distressed mortgages was higher going into the crisis. Contributing to the current high share of distressed mortgages is a longer than average foreclosure processing time in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, which keeps homes in the foreclosure pipeline longer. The share of mortgages at risk of foreclosure has now begun to decline in Philadelphia-the result of four years of modest job growth, fairly stable gains in home prices, and local legislation in 2008 that sharply curtailed foreclosure activity.

Administration Programs Are Providing Much Needed Relief to Philadelphia MSA. From the launch of the Administration's assistance programs in April 2009 through the end of May 2014, more than 151,800 homeowners have received mortgage assistance in the Philadelphia MSA. Nearly 89,000 interventions were completed through the HAMP and FHA loss mitigation intervention programs. An additional 62,800 proprietary mortgage modifications have been made through HOPE Now Alliance servicers. While some homeowners may have received help from more than one program, the number of times assistance has been provided in the Philadelphia metropolitan area is more than four times the number of foreclosures completed during this period (37,300). In addition, the landmark National Mortgage Servicing Settlement in February 2012 has benefitted more 9,418 Pennsylvania homeowners as of June 30, 2013.

HUD's Neighborhood Stabilization Program Is Funding Community Improvements. The Neighborhood Stabilization Program helps localities work with non-profits and community development corporations to turn abandoned and foreclosed homes that lower property values into homeownership opportunities and the affordable rental housing that communities need.

08/13/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-098.cfm,HUD and New Jersey Mortgage Company Settle Complaint Alleging Lending Discrimination Against Applicants Collecting Disability Income,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that Freedom Mortgage Corporation, a national residential mortgage lender based in Mt. Laurel, New Jersey, will pay $104,000 to settle allegations that it discriminated against loan applicants with disabilities by requiring them to provide medical or other documentation regarding their disability.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to discriminate in the sale, rental, and financing of dwellings, and in other housing-related transactions, based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, family status, or disability. This includes requiring persons with disabilities to provide medical or other documentation not required of mortgage applicants who are not disabled.
""Applicants who are otherwise qualified for a home loan may not have additional requirements placed on them because of a disability,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""We are pleased that this national mortgage lender, through the agreement, is making a commitment to comply with its obligation to treat persons with disabilities the same way they treat those who are not disabled.""
The agreement settles a HUD Secretary Initiated Complaint filed in 2013, alleging that Freedom Mortgage's underwriting policies and practices subjected persons with disabilities to different terms and conditions from other applicants by requiring, among other things, that they provide doctor's notes or letters from the Social Security Administration that their disability income would continue for three years. Freedom and HUD identified 69 applicants with disabilities subjected to such terms and conditions.
In one case, a loan applicant provided medical documentation of his disability, a Department of Labor Work Capacity Evaluation form, and a benefits statement showing regular disability payments since 2009. Nonetheless, Freedom Mortgage allegedly continued to request proof that the income would continue for at least three years.
Under the terms of the agreement, Freedom will establish a three-tiered system of relief for the 69 aggrieved applicants. Under the tiered system, they will each receive $1,000, $2,000, or $5,000 in damages In addition, Freedom will amend its underwriting guidelines to abolish disability-related income verification requirements for applicants who receive disability income, and require employees to attend training on the Fair Housing Act."
08/19/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-099.cfm,HUD Charges Kent State University with Housing Discrimination for Refusing to Allow Support Animal in Campus Housing,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has charged Kent State University, in Kent, OH, and four of its employees with housing discrimination for refusing to allow a student with disabilities to keep an emotional support animal in her campus apartment.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to refuse to make reasonable accommodations in policies or practices when a person with adisability requires such an accommodation, including refusing to grant waivers to ""no-pet"" policies for persons who use assistance or support animals.
""Many people with disabilities rely on therapy animals to enhance their quality of life,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""The Fair Housing Act protects their right to the support they need and HUD is committed to taking action whenever the nation's fair housing laws are violated.""
HUD's charge stems from complaints that were filed by a Kent State University student and her husband and Fair Housing Advocates Association (FHAA), Inc., a non-profit advocacy organization based in Akron, OH. The student and her husband lived in university-owned and operated housing that is set aside for upperclassmen and their families. A university psychologist treating the student documented her disabilities and wrote a letter stating that the best way for the student to cope with her disabilities was having a support animal. The student subsequently obtained a dog and submitted a reasonable accommodation request to the university seeking a waiver to the apartment complex's ""no pets"" rule.
In her complaint, the student alleged that the university offered her academic accommodations, which she did not need, but denied her request to keep her support animal. As a result of the denial, the student and her husband were forced to move to an apartment the university did not own. Shortly after the move, the student and her husband contacted FHAA.
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages to the woman and her husband for the harm caused them by the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose fines to vindicate the public interest. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages.

EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take two months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, 4 months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2%) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90-percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised about three percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found on our web site listed above.
* 90% confidence interval includes zero. The Census Bureau does not have sufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero.

08/21/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-101.cfm,"Obama Administration Settlement with Bank of America will Strengthen FHA Fund, Provide Billions in Consumer Relief","WASHINGTON - The Obama Administration today announced an almost $17 billion global settlement with Bank of America. $1 billion of the total settlement amount resolves claims arising from allegations of fraud involving certain Federal Housing Administration (FHA)-insured single-family mortgage loans and a failure to perform under its servicing contract with the Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae). Under the terms of the settlement, Bank of America will pay $800 million to resolve the claims relating to FHA and $200 million to Ginnie Mae. The remaining nearly $16 billion of the total settlement amount resolves fraud claims involving the pooling of residential mortgage backed securities, collateralized debt obligations, and other claims by the United States, along with the States of California, Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, New York, and the Commonwealth of Kentucky, and includes $7 billion in consumer relief with a focus on borrowers that were in the hardest-hit areas during the housing crisis.
""Today's settlement with Bank of America is another important step in the Obama Administration's efforts to provide relief to American homeowners who were hurt during the housing crisis,"" said U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Julián Castro. ""This global settlement will strengthen the FHA fund and Ginnie Mae, and it will provide $7 billion in consumer relief with a focus on helping borrowers in areas that were the hardest hit during the crisis. HUD will continue working with the Department of Justice, state attorneys general, and other partners to take appropriate action to hold financial institutions accountable for their misconduct and provide consumers with the relief they need to stay in their homes. HUD remains committed to solidifying the housing recovery and creating more opportunities for Americans to succeed.""
This settlement is part of the ongoing efforts of President Obama's Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force's RMBS Working Group.
Working with the Department of Justice, HUD's Office of General Counsel, Office of Housing, and Office of the Inspector General worked extensively on the fraud investigation involving FHA-insured single-family mortgage loans that were underwritten by Bank of America during the period from May 1, 2009, to April 1, 2011. HUD also provided assistance with respect to a breach of contract claim involving Bank of America's role as one of two master subservicers for Ginnie Mae's portfolio of defaulted single-family mortgages.
The $7 billion in consumer relief will focus on areas that were hardest hit during the housing crisis. Consumer relief will take various forms including loan modification for distressed borrowers, including FHA-insured borrowers, and new loans to credit worthy borrowers struggling to get a loan in hardest hit areas, borrowers who lost homes to foreclosure or short sales, and moderate income first-time homebuyers. Bank of America will also make donations to community development funds, legal aid organizations, and housing counseling agencies to assist individuals with foreclosure prevention and to support community reinvestment and neighborhood stabilization. They will also provide financing for affordable rental housing with a focus on family housing in high-cost areas. An independent monitor will be appointed to ensure compliance with the terms of the agreement."

08/26/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-103.cfm,"HUD, VA, and USICH Announce 33% Drop in Veteran Homelessness Since 2010","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH) today released a new national estimate of veteran homelessness in the United States. Data collected during the annual Point-in-Time Count conducted in January 2014 shows there were 49,933 homeless veterans in America, a decline of 33 percent (or 24,837 people) since 2010. This includes a nearly 40 percent drop in the number of veterans sleeping on the street.
HUD, VA, USICH, and local partners have used evidenced-based practices like Housing First and federal resources like HUD-VASH (the HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing voucher program) to get veterans off the street and into stable housing as quickly as possible. Since 2008, the HUD-VASH program has served a total of 74,019 veterans.
""We have an obligation to ensure that every veteran has a place to call home,"" said U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro. ""In just a few years, we have made incredible progress reducing homelessness among veterans, but we have more work to do. HUD will continue collaborating with our federal and local partners to ensure that all of the men and women who have served our country have a stable home and an opportunity to succeed.""
""The Department of Veterans Affairs and our federal and local partners should be proud of the gains made reducing Veterans' homelessness,"" said Secretary of Veterans Affairs Robert McDonald, ""but so long as there remains a Veteran living on our streets, we have more work to do.""
""As a nation, we have proven that homelessness is a problem we can solve,"" said U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness Executive Director Laura Green Zeilinger. ""Communities all across the country are meeting this costly tragedy with urgency and a focus on helping all veterans and their families achieve safe and stable housing.""
To accelerate progress on meeting the goal of ending veteran homelessness by 2015, First Lady Michelle Obama launched the Administration's ""Mayors Challenge to End Veteran Homelessness"" in spring 2014. So far, more than 210 mayors, county, and state officials have committed to ending homelessness among veterans in their communities.
The federal government has provided significant new resources to help communities pursue the goal of ending homelessness among veterans. Communities that target these resources strategically are making significant progress and can end veteran homelessness in their communities in 2015. These strategies include:
Using a Housing First approach, which removes barriers to help veterans obtain permanent housing as quickly as possible, without unnecessary prerequisites; Prioritizing the most vulnerable veterans—especially those experiencing chronic homelessness—for permanent supportive housing opportunities, including those created through the HUD-VASH program; Coordinating outreach efforts to identify and engage every veteran experiencing homelessness and focus outreach efforts on achieving housing outcomes; Targeting rapid rehousing interventions, including those made possible through the Department of Veterans Affairs' Supportive Services for Veteran Families program, toward veterans who need shorter-term rental subsidies and services in order to be reintegrated back into our communities; Leveraging other housing and services resources that can help veterans who are ineligible for some of the VA's programs get into stable housing; Increasing early detection and access to preventive services so at-risk veterans remain stably housed; Closely monitoring progress toward the goal, including the success of programs achieving permanent housing outcomes; and Aligning local goals and strategies with Opening Doors: Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness.

08/26/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-104.cfm,"FHA to Eliminate ""Post Payment"" Interest Charges","WASHINGTON - The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) today announced that borrowers who prepay their FHA-insured mortgages will not have to make interest payments beyond the date their mortgage is paid in full. FHA's rule, Handling Prepayments: Eliminating Post-Payment Interest Charges (www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2014-08-26/pdf/2014-20214.pdf), applies for FHA-insured mortgages closed on or after January 21, 2015. This rule explicitly prohibits lenders from charging borrowers post settlement interest, which is broadly defined as a ""prepayment penalty"" by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), for all FHA Single Family mortgage products and programs.
In addition, FHA announced a new rule to ensure borrowers have early access to information when making decisions about their FHA mortgages. Effective for FHA-insured Adjustable Rate Mortgages (ARMs) originated on or after January 10, 2015, this rule makes two revisions to FHA's ARM Program. It requires lenders:
To provide borrowers of FHA-insured ARMs with at least a 60-day but no more than 120-day advance notice of an adjustment to their monthly payment. FHA currently requires a 25-day advance notice.
• To provide borrowers of FHA-insured ARMs with at least a 60-day but no more than 120-day advance notice of an adjustment to their monthly payment. FHA currently requires a 25-day advance notice.
To base an interest rate adjustment that results in a corresponding change to the borrower's monthly payment on the most recent index value available 45 days before the date of the rate adjustment (commonly referred to as a ""look back period""). FHA currently requires a 30-day look-back period.
• To base an interest rate adjustment that results in a corresponding change to the borrower's monthly payment on the most recent index value available 45 days before the date of the rate adjustment (commonly referred to as a ""look back period""). FHA currently requires a 30-day look-back period.

Together, these new rules are responsive to the regulations implementing the Truth-in-Lending Act (Regulation Z) as revised last year by the CFPB. These policies provide consistent protections for borrowers with FHA-insured mortgages, while ensuring borrowers have early access to information when making decisions about their FHA mortgages."

The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to discriminate in the terms, conditions, or privileges associated with the sale or rental of a dwelling on the basis of sex or familial status, including denying a mortgage loan or mortgage insurance because an applicant is pregnant or on maternity leave.
The Conciliation Agreement resolves a complaint filed with HUD by a married couple who alleged that after FirstBank had approved their application and scheduled its closing, FirstBank learned that the wife was on maternity leave and notified the couple within 24 hours of the scheduled closing that the loan was denied. The couple alleged that they then lost the opportunity to buy a home in Virginia. The couple allegedly also lost their current housing, requiring the wife and infant twins to move in with her parents while the husband moved to an apartment with their three-year old. According to the complaint, FirstBank did not consider the couple's ability to make loan payments during the wife's maternity leave, ignoring the husband's salary and the wife's short-term disability insurance payments.
""No qualified applicant should be denied a mortgage loan solely because they take maternity, paternity or parental leave,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will continue to enforce the nation's fair housing laws to ensure no one is illegally denied the opportunity to own a home.""
Under the terms of the agreement, FirstBank Mortgage Partners will pay $35,000 to the couple that filed the complaint. The company will also adopt a national paternal leave policy and receive annual fair housing and fair lending training.
Persons who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed at www.hud.gov/fairhousing or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, which can be accessed through Apple devices, such as the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch."

As the chairman of U.S. National Preparatory Committee, Castro, in coordination with the State Department and other Federal agencies, will work with leading policy thinkers to use Habitat III to share approaches and ideas to address vexing urban and housing challenges in the U.S. and across the globe.
In 1976, the United Nations convened Habitat I in Vancouver, Canada, which sparked an international conversation on urban issues. Twenty years later, at the Habitat II conference in Istanbul, Turkey, world leaders endorsed the Habitat Agenda as a global action plan to create adequate shelter for all. At Habitat III, participants will analyze progress made on commitments made at Habitat II and Member States will develop a ""New Urban Agenda"" that addresses 21st Century urban challenges and harnesses the tremendous potential of cities to promote sustainable development globally."

The Fair Housing Act prohibits lenders from discriminating in making mortgages available or in the terms or conditions of a mortgage transaction based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, family status, or disability.
""A person's race and national origin have no effect on their credit worthiness,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will continue to work to give all families an equal opportunity at homeownership by ensuring that lenders meet their obligation to comply with the Fair Housing Act.""
The agreement settles a complaint that was filed by a Native American couple alleging that U.S. Bank, the bank's appraiser Red Sky Risk Services, and one of the bank's loan officers discriminated against the couple when they attempted to refinance their home loan. In denying the couple's loan application, U.S. Bank allegedly determined that the ""value or type of collateral was not sufficient."" The loan officer allegedly told the couple that, because their property is located on a Native American reservation, U.S. Bank was not able to make the loan and that Red Sky Risk Services was not able to appraise the property.
The property, located within the Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation, is held in ""fee simple,"" which means that the couple holds the title to the property, without restriction, in the same way that land is generally held throughout the United States.
Under the terms of the agreement, U.S. Bank agreed to pay the couple's U.S. Bank credit card balance in the amount of $11,489.56, and to approve their application for a home mortgage refinance loan at the same interest rate and under other terms and conditions for which they originally applied. U.S. Bank and Red Sky Risk Services also agreed to amend their policies regarding home mortgage loans on land located within the boundaries of a Native American reservation to be consistent with the Fair Housing Act and to provide fair housing training for their employees."

He was joined by Dr. Judith Rodin, President of the Rockefeller Foundation, in announcing that eligible states and localities can now begin applying for funds. Representatives from eligible communities will have the opportunity to attend Rockefeller-supported Resilience Academies across the country to strengthen their funding proposals.
""The National Disaster Resilience Competition is going to help communities that have been devastated by natural disasters build back stronger and better prepared for the future,"" said Secretary Julián Castro. ""This competition will help spur innovation, creatively distribute limited federal resources, and help communities across the country cope with the reality of severe weather that is being made worse by climate change.""
""The Rockefeller Foundation is committed to spurring innovation in resilience planning and design so that communities can build better, more resilient futures, particularly for their most vulnerable citizens,"" said Dr. Judith Rodin, President of the Rockefeller Foundation. ""Building resilience will minimize the impact of the next shock, while also improving life in communities day-to-day, allowing them to yield a resilience dividend. Everyone wins.""
NATIONAL DISASTER RESILIENCE COMPETITION
As the recent National Climate Assessment (http://nca2014.globalchange.gov/) made clear, extreme weather events—including heat waves, drought, tropical storms, high winds, storm surges and heavy downpours—are becoming more severe. In many places these risks are projected to increase substantially due to rising sea levels and evolving development patterns, causing risks to the safety, health, and economies of entire communities. Events like Hurricane Sandy have made it clear we remain vulnerable to such events in spite of advances in disaster preparedness. American communities cannot effectively reduce their risks and vulnerabilities without planning for future extreme events and other impacts of climate change after a disaster and in their everyday decision-making.
The National Disaster Resilience Competition makes $1 billion available to communities that have been struck by natural disasters in recent years. The competition promotes risk assessment and planning and will fund the implementation of innovative resilience projects to better prepare communities for future storms and other extreme events. Funding for the competition is from the Community Development Block Grant disaster recovery (CDBG-DR) appropriation provided by the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013 (PL 113-2).
This competition responds to requests from state, local, and tribal leaders who have asked the federal government to help them prepare their communities for the impacts of climate change and support investments in more resilient infrastructure.
All successful applicants will need to tie their proposals to the eligible disaster from which they are recovering. For example, a community that suffered a flood might want to offer flood buyouts and property acquisition in the most impacted and distressed areas, followed by restoration of a wetland to limit future flooding and provide a nature preserve or recreation area. A community that lost housing and a road during a mudslide might want to not only construct housing in a safer area for survivors, but also find a financing mechanism for affected downstream businesses to survive the effects of the last event and be prepared for and recover more quickly from future hazards.
Partnership with Rockefeller Foundation
Given the complexity of the challenge, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) will partner with the Rockefeller Foundation to help communities better understand the innovation, broad commitment, and multi-faceted approach that is required to build toward a more resilient future. As they did in HUD's Rebuild by Design (www.rebuildbydesign.org/) competition, the Rockefeller Foundation will provide targeted technical assistance to eligible communities and support a stakeholder-driven process, informed by the best available data, to identify recovery needs and innovative solutions. The six winning projects selected through the Rebuild by Design (www.rebuildbydesign.org/) competition in June 2014 serve as models of how philanthropic resources and the federal government can be leveraged to support communities recovering from disasters while also strengthening their ability to withstand future disasters.
Eligible Applicants
There are 67 eligible applicants for the $1 billion National Disaster Resilience Competition. All states with counties that experienced a Presidentially Declared Major Disaster in 2011, 2012 or 2013 are eligible to submit applications that address unmet needs as well as vulnerabilities to future extreme events, stresses, threats, hazards, or other shocks in areas that were most impacted and distressed as a result of the effects of the Qualified Disaster. This includes 48 of 50 states plus Puerto Rico and Washington, DC.[1] In addition, 17 local governments that have received funding under PL 113-2 are also eligible. You can find a list of eligible applicants here.
Objectives
The Competition seeks to meet the following six objectives:
• Fairly and effectively allocate $1 billion in remaining CDBG-DR funds.[2]
• Create multiple examples of modern disaster recovery that apply science-based and forward-looking risk analysis to address recovery, resilience, and revitalization needs.
• Leave a legacy of institutionalizing—in as many states and local jurisdictions as possible—the implementation of thoughtful, sound, and resilient approaches to addressing future risks.
• Provide resources to help communities plan and implement disaster recovery that makes them more resilient to future extreme weather events or other shocks, while also improving quality of life for existing residents.
• Fully engage community stakeholders to inform them about the impacts of climate change and develop pathways to resilience based on sound science.
• Leverage investments from the philanthropic community to help communities define problems, set policy goals, explore options, and craft solutions to inform their own local and regional resilient recovery strategies.
Overview of Phases
The National Disaster Resilience Competition is a year-long competition structured in two phases: (1) the framing phase and (2) the implementation phase. The competition is structured to guide applicants in the framing phase through broad consideration of their disaster recovery needs, vulnerabilities, stakeholder interests, resilience and other community development investment alternatives. Then they can refine those needs and design potential solutions in the implementation phase.
Phase 1 applications will be due in March 2015. Successful applicants in Phase 1 will be invited to participate in Phase 2 to design solutions for recovery and resilience. Phase 2 applications must also include an analysis for any proposed projects with an account of the social and ecological benefits and costs as a consideration. The best proposals from Phase 2 will receive funds for implementation and will demonstrate how communities across the country can build a more resilient future. HUD expects to make final award announcements in late 2015.

New Residential Construction data for September 2014 will be released on Friday, October 17, 2014, at 8:30 A.M. EDT.
EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take two months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, 4 months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2%) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90-percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised about three percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found on our web site listed above.
* 90% confidence interval includes zero. The Census Bureau does not have sufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero.

09/19/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-113.cfm,Obama Administration Announces Competition to Designate Next Round of Promise Zones,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Julián Castro joined U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx, and Education Secretary Arne Duncan to announce a competition to designate a new round of Promise Zones. These Promise Zones are part of the President's plan to create a new pathway to the middle class by partnering with local communities and businesses to create jobs, increase economic security, improve educational opportunities, and reduce violent crime.
Urban, rural, and tribal communities nationwide will be invited to put forward a plan to partner with local business and community leaders to make evidence-based investments that reward hard work and expand opportunity. In exchange, these designees will receive priority access to federal investments that further their strategic plans, federal staff on the ground to help them implement their goals, and five full-time AmeriCorps VISTA members to recruit and manage volunteers and strengthen the capacity of the Promise Zone initiatives.
""As a former mayor of an urban Promise Zone community, I have a unique appreciation for the talent, passion and the vision that local leaders offer when working to turn their communities around,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""Promise Zones are about giving folks who have been underserved for far too long the opportunity to build stronger neighborhoods and more prosperous lives. At HUD, we're honored to give other communities the opportunity to transform their futures so this work can continue across the country.""
""The Promise Zones initiative allows us to work directly with local leaders and organizations to meet a community's specific needs,"" said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. ""In the current Promise Zones, especially in rural and tribal areas, we are seeing how effective it can be when we work in a coordinated way to address economic and social challenges. We've seen economic recovery strategies like this create jobs and opportunity through USDA's community-based StrikeForce Initiative and Promise Zones build on this success.""
""As a former mayor, I know the difference that can be made when federal agencies work together to cut through red tape and deliver strategic solutions that address a community's needs,"" said Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx. ""The Department of Transportation is proud to work alongside other agencies to make sure communities not only offer good homes, thriving businesses and a clean environment, but an efficient transportation system so its people can enjoy them all, too.""
Education Secretary Arne Duncan added, ""At the heart of every strong community is a great school, but schools can't do it alone - it takes the whole community to help improve outcomes for students in school and in life. Promise Zones create real pathways to success for families in our most impoverished communities across the country by attracting private investment, increasing affordable housing, improving educational opportunities and assisting local leaders in cutting through red tape. I am excited to join our interagency partners in announcing this new opportunity for communities to become a Promise Zone.""
Each Promise Zone selected will have demonstrated that local leaders, business leaders, state, tribal and local officials; faith-based and non-profit organizations; children and parents are collaborating effectively to ensure that hard work leads to a decent living for every American, in every community.
In 2009, after a generation of sometimes counterproductive and often contradictory federal engagement that was creating obstacles to greater shared prosperity, local communities across the country demanded a more effective and responsive federal government partner to create new pathways to the middle class. To meet this demand, the Obama Administration adopted a variety of unprecedented place-based efforts to promote economic opportunity and accelerate economic growth by explicitly connecting key federal programs that support such growth, such as education, housing, economic development, and infrastructure, with locally-devised strategies for broadly shared regional growth.
In January of this year, President Obama announced the first five Promise Zones: San Antonio, TX, Los Angeles, CA, Philadelphia, PA, Southeastern Kentucky Highlands and the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma. The work being done in these communities is already helping to move the needle in key areas. For example, graduation rates have reached 90 percent in the San Antonio Promise Zone; 2,000 kids in Los Angeles were able to find a summer job through a youth employment initiative; 900 unemployed people in Southeastern Kentucky have been connected to a job; and over 700 households and 50 businesses in remote southeast Oklahoma will soon have access to clean, safe drinking water for the first time. Today's announcement of a new Promise Zone competition will help bring similar success to high-poverty communities across the country.
Any community meeting the qualifying criteria can apply for a designation, regardless of whether it has a previous federal grant. HUD and USDA will designate at least 8 Promise Zones across urban, rural and tribal communities. The deadline for submitting Promise Zone applications is November 21, 2014.
HUD in close collaboration with USDA will convene three distinct webcasts for urban, rural, and tribal to discuss the second round of the Promise Zone Initiative with interested communities.
Dates and times are as follows: Tribal Webcast September 29th 1:00pm - 2:00pm Rural Webcast September 29th 3:00pm - 4:00pm Urban Webcast October 1st 3:00pm - 4:00pm

09/23/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-110.cfm,HUD Awards $7.5 Million to Help Seniors and Persons with Disabilities to Live Independently at Home,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro today announced nearly $7.5 million in grants to help thousands of senior citizens and persons with disabilities to receive health care, meals, and other critical supportive services. The grants are awarded through HUD's Multifamily Housing Service Coordinator Program (MHSC) (see attached list of grants below).
The grants announced today are awarded to 39 owners of private housing developments that receive rental subsidies from HUD to house low-income individuals in 21 states. These property owners or their management companies will hire or contract service coordinators with backgrounds in providing social services, especially to the frail elderly and people with disabilities, to assist their residents with special needs.
""Service coordinators connect senior citizens and those living with disabilities with the services they need to live independently,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""These grants will go a long way toward ensuring these vulnerable populations are well served and allowed to age in place.""
The grants awarded today are designed for an initial three-year period to allow eligible owners of multifamily housing for the elderly or disabled, to hire and support a service coordinator. The funds cover such costs as salary, benefits, quality assurance, training, office space, equipment, and other related administrative expenses. A 2008 HUD report (www.huduser.org/portal/publications/hsgspec/serv_coord.html) found aging in place reduces rates of premature institutionalization for low-income elderly residents, thus reducing the costs borne by taxpayers.
As the U.S. population ages and the number of older Americans grows, there will be an increased need for programs to help very low-income elderly persons to continue living independently in their homes. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, there were 35 million people age 65 years or older in the U.S. in 2000, and it estimates that by 2050 that number will climb to 80 million."
09/23/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-111.cfm,HUD Awards $17 Million to Convert Apartments into Assisted Living or Service-Enriched Senior Housing,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today awarded $17 million in grants to the owners of multi-family housing developments in six states to convert some or all of their apartments into assisted living or service-enriched environments for elderly residents (see attached list for grant recipients).
The funding announced today is provided through HUD's Assisted Living Conversion Program which supports the transformation of housing into units that can accommodate the special needs of seniors seeking to remain in their homes or 'age in place.'
""There is a growing demand for affordable housing that will allow lower income seniors to live independently and age in place in their own homes,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""These grants will help these apartment owners to offer assisted living or service-enriched environments that will allow their senior residents to remain in their homes for as long as they can.""
HUD's Assisted Living Conversion Program grants provide private, nonprofit owners of eligible developments with resources to convert some or all of the dwelling units in the project into an Assisted Living Facility (ALF) or Service-Enriched Housing (SEH) for elderly residents aging in place. Licensed and regulated by the State or local community, Assisted Living Facilities (ALFs) are designed to accommodate frail elderly and people with disabilities who can live independently but need assistance with activities of daily living (e.g., assistance with eating, bathing, grooming, dressing and home management activities). ALFs must provide support services such as personal care, transportation, meals, housekeeping, and laundry.
Service-Enriched Housing is designed to accommodate frail elderly persons or elderly persons with service needs who are aging in place. Residents are able to live independently but need assistance with activities of daily living comparable to services typically provided in a licensed assisted living facility, such as healthcare-related services. These supportive services must be available through a licensed or certified third party service provider. Service-Enriched Housing is housing that accommodates the provision of services to elderly residents who need assistance with activities of daily living in order to live independently.

This is 18.0 percent (±16.3%)* above the revised July rate of 427,000 and is 33.0 percent (±21.7%)* above the August 2013 estimate of 379,000.
The median sales price of new houses sold in August 2014 was $275,600; the average sales price was $347,900. The seasonally adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of August was 203,000. This represents a supply of 4.8 months at the current sales rate.
New Residential Sales data for September 2014 will be released on Friday, October 24, 2014, at 10:00 A.M. EDT.

Preliminary new home sales figures are subject to revision due to the survey methodology and definitions used. The survey is primarily based on a sample of houses selected from building permits. Since a ""sale"" is defined as a deposit taken or sales agreement signed, this can occur prior to a permit being issued. An estimate of these prior sales is included in the sales figure. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimate of total sales is revised about three percent. Changes in sales price data reflect changes in the distribution of houses by region, size, etc., as well as changes in the prices of houses with identical characteristics.

09/24/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-115.cfm,"U.S. Department of Housing & Urban Development, U.S. Department of the Treasury, and the Ad Council Launch New Public Service Ads to Reach Struggling Homeowners","WASHINGTON, DC - In an effort to increase awareness of the Making Home Affordable® (MHA) Program's free resources and assistance for struggling homeowners, the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury), the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and the Ad Council today launched a new series of public service advertisements (PSAs) as a part of their Foreclosure Prevention Assistance campaign.
MHA launched in 2009 and is a critical part of the Administration's strategy to help homeowners avoid foreclosure, stabilize the country's housing market, and improve the nation's economy. The program offers a range of solutions, including lower monthly mortgage payments for struggling homeowners, as well as options for unemployed or underemployed homeowners and those who owe more than their homes are worth. To date, MHA has helped more than 1.5 million families nationwide.
This latest phase of the campaign aims to reach struggling homeowners who may be current on payments, but are, as a result of some hardship, juggling expenses to make ends meet. Many of these homeowners may be unaware that MHA has expanded its options, and may have a solution available to address their particular financial situation.
Nearly 1 in 17 homeowners has fallen behind on his or her mortgage, underscoring the continued need for MHA, which was recently extended through at least December 31, 2016.
""As the economy continues to heal from the Great Recession, many homeowners still struggle to make their mortgage payments,"" said Deputy Treasury Secretary Sarah Bloom Raskin. ""The good news is that help is still available. This new PSA campaign is our latest effort to raise awareness of the free government resources available through Making Home Affordable to assist struggling homeowners in avoiding foreclosure.""
""Although the housing market and economy are making a steady recovery, many struggling homeowners would still benefit from the one-on-one counseling services a HUD-approved housing agency can provide them,"" said Federal Housing Administration Commissioner Carol Galante. ""More than 1.5 million families have already benefitted from the Making Home Affordable Program, and we hope this effort to educate homeowners will lead to many more families using these free services and getting the help they need to stay in their homes.""
""While MHA has already helped so many across the country, our research shows that many families continue to rebalance their finances to meet their mortgage payments. They know they need help but don't know where to find it,"" said Peggy Conlon, president and CEO of the Ad Council. ""We hope the advertising will reach those in need, letting them know they don't have to face this problem alone and inspiring them to reach out for help.""
Ad Council research shows that many homeowners are juggling their finances each month in order to pay their mortgage. They may fall behind on other bills, work two jobs, and find ways to fix things around the house themselves in order to make ends meet. Even if these struggling American homeowners are not behind on their mortgage payments, they could still reach out for help from Making Home Affordable. With that in mind, Chicago-based advertising agency Schafer Condon Carter (SCC) created pro bono the new TV, print, radio, outdoor and digital PSAs to strongly encourage homeowners not to give up hope and remind them that there are free resources available to help.
""This new campaign will broaden the reach of MHA and extend the message of its benefits to more Americans who are struggling every day to meet the financial demands of their mortgages,"" said David Selby, President and Managing Partner of SCC. ""The advertising seeks to resonate with these homeowners by acknowledging the commitment they make to keep their homes while letting them know that there is additional help available.""
The PSAs, which are available in English and Spanish, direct homeowners to call 888-995-HOPE (4673) to speak one-on-one with experts at HUD-approved housing counseling agencies about solutions based on each family's individual circumstances. The Hotline is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Additionally, the campaign drives homeowners to MakingHomeAffordable.gov (www.makinghomeaffordable.gov/) for program eligibility and information.
Per the Ad Council model, all PSAs will be aired and run in time and space donated by media organizations. Since the campaign was launched in 2010, media outlets have donated over $135 million in airtime and space.

09/26/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-113b.cfm,HUD and LA Community Redevelopment Agency Settlement Creates Housing Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has reached a Voluntary Compliance Agreement (VCA) with the Community Redevelopment Agency of Los Angeles (CRA-LA) resolving allegations that housing funded by the agency was inaccessible to persons with disabilities. Under the agreement, CRA-LA will spend approximately $2.8 million to retrofit 140 units as well as common areas in 22 properties to make them fully accessible.
""Today's agreement reaffirms HUD's commitment to ensuring that housing funded by the federal government meets the needs of persons with disabilities,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""We commend LA's Community Redevelopment Agency for working cooperatively with HUD to resolve this matter and for agreeing to retrofit the units.""
Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibits any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance from discriminating on the basis of disability, including failing to meet accessibility standards. Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (www.ada.gov/2010_regs.htm) imposes similar requirements on state and local governments. In order to ensure that recipients of HUD funding comply with these requirements, HUD routinely conducts inspections and reviews.
In 2011, when HUD inspected properties funded by CRA-LA, it found that units were inaccessible to persons with disabilities, in violation of Section 504 and Title II of the ADA, including having bathrooms that would not allow a wheelchair to maneuver in them as well as kitchens whose sinks and counters were inaccessible to persons with disabilities. HUD's review determined that routes and parking spaces that were designed for persons with disabilities were not actually fully accessible. In addition, CRA-LA did not have policies and procedures in place to ensure that persons with disabilities know their rights to accessible features or accessible units.
Under the terms of the agreement, CRA-LA will spend approximately $2.8 million to retrofit inaccessible units at 22 properties. Specifically, the funds will supplement corrective actions that will be conducted by the owners of the properties to create at least 100 fully-accessible units and 40 units that are accessible for persons with sensory disabilities. CRA-LA will also appoint a Section 504/ADA coordinator to ensure residents are aware of their rights and provide as much as $500,000 to hire a HUD-approved consultant to review retrofitted properties and recommend accessibility changes.
Persons who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed at www.hud.gov/fairhousing or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, which can be accessed through Apple devices, such as the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch."
09/29/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-116.cfm,HUD Awards $75 Million to Help Low-Income Residents Receive Job Training and Employment,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today awarded $75 million to help public housing and Housing Choice Voucher residents across the country connect with local services to improve their education and employment and to put them on a path to self-sufficiency. Read more about the local impact of the grants announced today.
Funded through HUD's Family Self-Sufficiency Program (FSS), these grants allow public housing agencies (PHAs) to work with social service agencies, community colleges, businesses, and other local partners to help public housing residents and individuals participating in HUD's Housing Choice Voucher Program to increase their education or gain marketable skills that will enable them to obtain employment and advance in their current work. In 2014, Congress combined funding for the Public Housing FSS (PH FSS) and Housing Choice Voucher FSS (HCV FSS) programs into one program serving both populations.
As HUD approaches its 50th anniversary next year, HUD Secretary Julián Castro is focused on advancing policies that create opportunities for all Americans, including helping families and individuals secure quality housing by connecting housing efforts to education and job opportunities.
""HUD connects folks to opportunity,"" said Castro. ""These grants will link people to the computer access, financial literacy, job training, childcare and other tools they need to compete and succeed in the workplace. Every American deserves access to the skills and resources necessary to become self-sufficient.""
HUD's FSS Program helps local public housing authorities to hire service coordinators who work directly with residents to connect them with programs and services that already exist in the local community. These Service Coordinators also build relationships with the network of local service providers so as to more effectively serve the residents. The program encourages innovative strategies that link public housing and Housing Choice Voucher assistance with other resources to enable participating families to find jobs, increase earned income, reduce or eliminate the need for rental and/or welfare assistance, and make progress toward achieving economic independence and housing self-sufficiency.
Participants in the program sign a five-year contract that requires the head of the household to obtain employment and that no member of the FSS family is receiving cash welfare assistance at the end of the five-year term. Families in the FSS program have an interest-bearing escrow account established for them. The amount credited to the family's escrow account is based on increases in the family's earned income during the term of the FSS contract. If the family successfully completes its FSS contract, the family receives the escrow funds that it can use for any purpose, including improving credit scores, paying educational expenses, or a down-payment on a home. More information on the FSS program can be found here.
The Family Self Sufficiency (FSS) Program is a long-standing resource for increasing economic security and self-sufficiency among participants. HUD's Office of Policy Development and Research issued Evaluation of FSS Program: Prospective Study (www.huduser.org/portal/publications/affhsg/eval_fssp.html) in 2011 that evaluated the effectiveness of the FSS Program. Conducted from 2005 to 2009, the study showed that financial benefits are substantial for participants who remain in and complete the program. An earlier study (www.huduser.org/portal/publications/econdev/selfsufficiency.html) found that individuals who participated in the FSS program fared better financially than those who did not enroll in the program. HUD is currently conducting a longitudinal study on the program, with the first set of results expected in 2018."
09/30/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-117.cfm,HUD Awards $112 Million to Protect Children and Families from Dangerous Lead and Other Home Hazards,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today awarded more than $112 million in grants to 39 local and state government agenciesand research institutions to protect children and families from the hazards of lead-based paint and from other home health and safety hazards (see chart below).
The grant funding announced today will reduce the number of lead-poisoned children and protect families by targeting health hazards in nearly 7,000 low-income homes with significant lead and/or other home health and safety hazards. In addition, some of these grants will support research on increasing the effectiveness of hazard reduction methods. These programs have a demonstrated history of success, filling critical needs in communities where no other resources exist to address substandard housing that threatens the health of the most vulnerable residents, and filling research gaps essential for being able to reduce hazard reduction costs.
As HUD approaches its 50th anniversary next year, HUD Secretary Julián Castro is focused on advancing policies that create opportunities for all Americans, including helping children and families secure quality housing by protecting them from the hazards of lead-based paint and other home health and safety hazards.
""No person should ever be in harm's way when cooking dinner in their kitchen or playing with children in the living room,"" said Castro. ""These grant awards will help communities eliminate home-related hazards and give families new opportunities to thrive. Housing is a critical source of stability, and HUD is committed to helping ensure that all Americans have a healthy safe place to live.""
""Millions of families and children are seeing their hope for the future threatened by poor healthsimply because of where they live,"" noted Matthew E. Ammon, Acting Director of HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes. ""Every child deserves to grow up in a healthy home and yet far too many continue to be exposed to potentially dangerous lead and other health hazards in the home.""
Unsafe and unhealthy homes affect the health of millions of people of all income levels, geographic areas, and walks of life in the U.S. These unsafe and unhealthy homes affect the economy directly, through increased utilization of health care services, and indirectly through lost wages and increased school days missed. Housing improvements help prevent injuries and illnesses, reduce associated health care and social services costs, reduce absentee rates for children in school and adults at work, and reduce stress, all which help to improve the quality of life.
The following is a breakdown of the funding announced today by grant program:
Grant Program

Total
$112,314,017
* This includes the $11,402,967 HUD is awarding to assist in the promotion and development of programs to concurrently identify and address multiple housing-related health hazards with lead hazard control intervention work.
HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes promotes local efforts to eliminate dangerous lead paint and other housing-related health hazards from lower income homes; stimulate private sector investment in lead hazard control; support cutting-edge research on methods for assessing and controlling housing-related health and safety hazards; and educate the public about the dangers of hazards in the home. Read a complete project-by-project summary of the programs awarded grants today.
The funding announced today directs critical funds to cities, counties and states to eliminate dangerous lead paint and other housing-related health hazards in thousands of privately-owned, low-income housing units. HUD is also providing over $11.4 million to help communities mitigate multiple health hazards in high risk housing simultaneously,in conjunction with their lead hazard control activities.
Today's funding also directs funds to public and private universities and research organizations to improve methods to detect lead paint in the home, assess the effectiveness of lead laws, improve home fall protection for the elderly, improve sustainable pest management strategies, evaluate the health effects of smoke-free policies, and assess home air cleaning in reducing childhood asthma."
10/01/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-119.cfm,"HUD and VA Team Up to Help More Than 9,000 Homeless Veterans Find Permanent Homes","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) today announced more than $62 million to help more than 9,000 homeless veterans find permanent supportive housing. The rental assistance announced today is provided through the HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) Program which combines rental assistance from HUD with case management and clinical services provided by VA. See the local impact of the housing assistance announced today.
HUD is awarding $57 million to support 8,276 Tenant-Based Vouchers for rental units in the private market, and $5 million for 730 Project-Based Vouchers (PBV) for existing units or new construction in specific developments.
With HUD approaching its 50th anniversary next year, Secretary Julián Castro is focused on advancing policies that create opportunities for all Americans, including the broader Administration goal of ending homelessness among veterans. As First Lady Michelle Obama said in a Joining Forces (www.whitehouse.gov/joiningforces/) speech in July 2014, ""As Americans, the idea that anyone who has worn our country's uniform spends their nights sleeping on the ground should horrify us. And so it is truly our duty to right this wrong and put an end to veteran homelessness once and for all.""
HUD-VASH is an important part of the Obama Administration's efforts to provide critical housing and services to veterans experiencing homelessness that also includes HUD's Continuum of Care program as well as VA's Supportive Services for Veteran Families (SSVF).
""It is unacceptable that after their service and sacrifice, too many of our veterans find themselves living on our streets and in our shelters,"" said Secretary Castro. ""We've made significant progress reducing homelessness among veterans by a third in just four years, and these vouchers will continue to help communities build on these gains, providing targeted assistance to those in need to ensure that every veteran has a home.""
Welcoming the progress made with HUD and local partners under the leadership of President Obama, VA Secretary Robert McDonald added, ""As long as there remains a single veteran living on our streets, there is more work to be done. HUD-VASH vouchers are a vital tool in our efforts to reduce veteran homelessness.""
""Through the HUD-VASH program, communities are making historic progress toward ending homelessness by connecting veterans who have the most intensive service needs to the foundation of a home with supportive services,"" said Laura Green Zeilinger, Executive Director of the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness. ""The grant awards announced today add crucial resources to this effort, helping to deliver on the promise that every Veteran who has served America has a home in America.""
Last month, HUD, VA and USICH released a new national estimate of veteran homelessness in the United States. In January of 2013, thousands of cities and counties across the country reported 49,933 homeless veterans, a decline of 33 percent (or 24,837 people) since 2010. This includes a nearly 40 percent drop in the number of unsheltered veterans sleeping on the street.
Since 2008, more than 59,000 vouchers have been awarded and over 74,000 homeless veterans have been served through the HUD-VASH program. Rental assistance and support services provided through HUD-VASH are a critical resource for local communities in ending homelessness among our nation's veterans.
Additionally, Opening Doors: Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness (http://usich.gov/opening_doors) serves as a roadmap for how the federal government will work with state and local communities to confront the root causes of homelessness, especially among former servicemen and women. As evidence of that commitment, President Obama has asked for an additional $75 million for HUD-VASH vouchers to serve veterans experiencing homelessness in his fiscal year 2015 budget request to Congress.
In the HUD-VASH program, VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) assess veterans experiencing homelessness before referring them to local housing agencies for these vouchers. Decisions are based on a variety of factors, most importantly the duration of homelessness and the need for longer term, more intensive support in obtaining and maintaining permanent housing. The HUD-VASH program includes both the rental assistance the voucher provides and the comprehensive case management that VAMC staff offers.
Veterans participating in the HUD-VASH program rent privately owned housing and generally contribute no more than 30 percent of their income toward rent. VA offers eligible homeless veterans clinical and supportive services through its medical centers across the U.S., Guam and Puerto Rico."
10/02/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-121.cfm,HUD and Philadelphia-Area Borough Settle Allegations of Housing Discrimination Against Victims of Domestic Violence,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has reached a Conciliation Agreement with Norristown, Pennsylvania, settling allegations that the municipality violated the Fair Housing Act when it enacted ordinances that held landlords responsible for evicting tenants cited for ""disorderly behavior,"" including domestic violence incidents, or risk being fined or losing their rental license. Norristown's City Council subsequently repealed the original law but passed a similar ordinance that same day which called for charging landlords mounting fines for tenants that display disruptive behavior.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to evict an individual because of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, disability, or familial status. In addition, the Violence Against Women Act provides legal protections for victims of domestic violence, including protections against eviction in certain cases.
""It's discriminatory to deny housing to a woman for violence committed against her. To face discrimination, on top of domestic violence, only compounds the injustice,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""The Department will continue to educate municipalities about their responsibility to uphold laws that protect the housing rights of survivors of domestic violence.""
The agreement is the result of a Secretary-initiated complaint that HUD filed alleging that Norristown discriminated against women when it enacted two similar ordinances that held landlords responsible for their tenants and encouraged them to evict tenants cited for ""disorderly behavior"" or risk being fined or losing their rental license. Several tenants were cited for disorderly behavior that included calls to police for domestic disturbances. In one case, a female tenant was cited for disorderly behavior three times stemming from three instances when her ex-boyfriend forced his way into her unit and assaulted her. The third instance resulted in the tenant being airlifted to the hospital after being stabbed by her ex-boyfriend. The tenant's ex-boyfriend was charged with assault and other charges and incarcerated, yet the tenant received the third citation for disorderly behavior, causing Norristown officials to pressure her landlord to evict her.
Under a settlement with the ACLU, Norristown repealed the revised ordinance, removing any potential actions against survivors of domestic violence, and paid $495,000 toward a named victim.
Under the terms of this agreement with HUD, Norristown must now publish a notice of repeal of its ordinance in the local newspaper; offer fair housing training to city and public safety officials; print and distribute a fair housing rights brochure that specifically encourages all tenants to call the police when they are in need of help; and work with a local domestic violence advocacy group to develop and promote an annual community service day or other activity to raise awareness of domestic violence.
Public and federally-funded housing providers already must comply with the Violence Against Women Act and HUD regulations that provide protection for victims of domestic violence.
Persons who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY).

10/02/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-122.cfm,HUD Reaches Settlement with Midland States Bancorp Resolving Allegations of Redlining by the Bank,"WASHINGTON - The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has negotiated a Conciliation Agreement with Illinois-based Midland States Bancorp, resolving allegations that the bank avoided doing business in predominantly African American and Hispanic neighborhoods in St. Louis, Missouri and northern Illinois.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to deny or discriminate in the terms and conditions of a mortgage or loan modification based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, or disability.
""Today's settlement demonstrates HUD's ongoing commitment to addressing lending discrimination, no matter what form it takes,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Everyone, regardless of their race or national origin, should have equal access to banking services and HUD will continue to take appropriate action to end discriminatory practices.""
The settlement with Midland States Bancorp is the result of a housing discrimination complaint that was filed by Metropolitan St. Louis Equal Housing and Opportunity Council (EHOC), a HUD Fair Housing Initiatives Program agency. EHOC's complaint alleged that the bank delineated its service area in a discriminatory manner that excluded areas of high minority concentration, a practice known as redlining. EHOC's complaint also alleged that the bank located branches in a manner that did not give equal access to customers based on race and national origin, and failed to market residential real estate loans in African American and Hispanic communities.
Under the terms of the agreement, Midland States Bancorp will:
originate $8 million in mortgage loans in majority-minority neighborhoods over the next three years, and establish a $550,000 Subsidy Fund to provide discounted home purchases or home refinancing loans in majority-minority markets in St. Louis, Central Illinois/Champaign, and Northern Illinois and/or Joliet;
• originate $8 million in mortgage loans in majority-minority neighborhoods over the next three years, and establish a $550,000 Subsidy Fund to provide discounted home purchases or home refinancing loans in majority-minority markets in St. Louis, Central Illinois/Champaign, and Northern Illinois and/or Joliet;
originate $3 million in home repair loans in majority-minority census tracts, and establish a $400,000 Subsidy Fund for affordable home repair loans that will assist homeowners in majority-minority census tracts in St. Louis and northern Illinois, including Joliet, who experienced financial distress and deferred maintenance on their properties, and
• originate $3 million in home repair loans in majority-minority census tracts, and establish a $400,000 Subsidy Fund for affordable home repair loans that will assist homeowners in majority-minority census tracts in St. Louis and northern Illinois, including Joliet, who experienced financial distress and deferred maintenance on their properties, and
originate an aggregate of $4 million in loans for multifamily housing located in majority-minority census tracts in St. Louis and northern Illinois over the next three years.
• originate an aggregate of $4 million in loans for multifamily housing located in majority-minority census tracts in St. Louis and northern Illinois over the next three years.
In addition, the bank will open a full-service branch in Joliet, Illinois, a loan production branch in St. Louis, and, tentatively, a full service branch in St. Louis. All of the branches will be located in majority-minority census tracts.
The agreement also provides funding for affirmative marketing to African Americans and Hispanics, financial education for individuals and small businesses, support for training and education, and $200,000 for EHOC.
Persons who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY).

10/06/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-120.cfm,HUD Awards Nearly $60 Million to Promote Affordable Housing and Economic Development in Native American Communities,"WASHINGTON - Today in Anchorage, Alaska, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro announced $60 million in funding to more than 90 tribal communities throughout the nation to improve housing conditions and stimulate community development, including construction projects and local jobs for low-income families. Provided through HUD's Indian Community Development Block Grant (ICDBG) Program, these funds support a wide variety of community development and affordable housing activities. See the local impact of the funding announced today.
""These grants will create better housing, spur economic development and support self-determination in Native American communities,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""ICDBG funds are an important investment in the remote and low-income tribal communities that need it most. Through this work, we're proud to help our tribal partners expand opportunity in their community by determining on their own, not from Washington, which local projects meet their needs and strengthen their future.""
The purpose of the ICDBG program is to develop viable Indian and Alaska Native communities, including decent housing, suitable living environments, and economic opportunities. Recipients can use the funding to support rehabbing or building new housing or to buy land for housing; for infrastructure such as roads, water and sewer facilities; and to spur economic development including job creation.
This year's projects include building an education center by the Hopland Band of Pomo Indians in California to provide preschool, child care, afterschool programs and education for adults. In Michigan, the Hannahville Indian Community will extend a natural gas line to provide affordable fuel costs to heat the homes of 49 low-income families. In Idaho, the Nez Perce Housing Authority will complete housing rehab to include handicapped accessible units for low-income senior citizens. Read summaries of all the winners.
For the first time in fiscal year 2014, the awards will also be used through a special program to remediate and prevent mold in housing units owned or operated by tribes and tribally designated housing entities. Nine tribes will receive funding for mold remediation, including the Havasupai Tribe in Arizona, where the village is located at the bottom of the Grand Canyon and mold is common due in part to frequent flooding.
The ICDBG program was established in 1977 to help Indian tribes and Alaska Native villages to meet their community development needs. Federally recognized Indian tribes, bands, groups or nations (including Alaska Indian, Aleuts and Eskimos,) Alaska Native villages, and eligible tribal organizations compete for this funding.
HUD administers six programs that are specifically targeted to American Indian, Alaska Native, or native Hawaiian individuals and families, and federally recognized tribal governments. In Fiscal Year 2014, HUD received more than $736 million to fund programs to support housing and development initiatives in American Indian, Alaska Native, and native Hawaiian communities. Through innovative programming, American Indian and Alaska Native tribal governments have created sustainable and community-driven solutions to their housing and community development challenges."
10/08/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-125.cfm,HUD Takes Action in California and Kansas Cases Where Hostile Apartment Rules Against Children Included No Playing Outside,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has reached a discrimination settlement agreement with a Napa Valley apartment owner and charged the owners of a Lenexa, Kansas, apartment complex with discrimination as a result of management at the two sites allegedly putting overly restrictive rules into place to control the free movement of children. Allegations include management placing restrictions on children playing outside, and in one case forcing children to clean the manager's office toilet when the youths were found outside unaccompanied by an adult.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in the sale, rental, and financing of dwellings, based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, and disability. This includes setting rules that discriminate against families with children.
""Placing special rules on families with children unfairly singles them out and creates a hostile living environment that is authoritarian and unequal,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""The Fair Housing Act protects the rights of families with children to enjoy their homes the same way as other households.""
In Napa Valley, California, seven affected families, and the nonprofit group Fair Housing of Napa Valley, filed complaints with HUD alleging that the manager at the River Park Manor Apartments cursed at children when he found them playing outside unaccompanied, and then ordered the children to his office and instructed them to sit on the floor. HUD's charge further alleges that once at the office, the manager required the children to clean the office toilet and pick up trash around the complex, and threatened them by telling them that their families may be evicted if they did not comply with his instructions. The apartments also had a rule prohibiting children from using the swimming pool during certain hours.
Under the terms of the agreement, the owners and manager of River Park Manor Apartments will pay Fair Housing of Napa Valley $3,750; waive four months of rent for five of the families (a total monetary value of $19,000); pay two former tenants a total of $7,000; eliminate the rule that limits pool usage by children during the day; and obtain fair housing training for employees.
In a separate case, HUD charged the owners and property managers of The Reserve Apartments in Lenexa, Kansas, with violating the Fair Housing Act when they allegedly instituted a policy that prohibited children under the age of 16 from freely using the common areas of the property.
According to HUD's charge, the property's policies allegedly required children to be supervised by an adult at all times and prohibited youth from playing anywhere on the property except the playground. The rules also allegedly prohibited kids from playing any team sports on the property, and from riding bicycles, skateboards, or scooters on the property. One of the affected families was a single mother who had a 14-year-old son. When she complained that her son was essentially on ""lockdown,"" the management office allegedly refused to renew the family's lease in retaliation. A United States Administrative Law Judge will hear the charge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court.

10/08/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-126.cfm,West Virginia and Tennessee Landlords Charged with Sexual Harassment after Female Renters Coerced to Comply or Lose Home,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced today that it has charged housing providers in West Virginia and Tennessee with sexually harassing female tenants and threatening them with homelessness if they did not comply.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful for a housing manager or owner to sexually harass a tenant. This includes conditioning housing on the tenant's acquiescence to sexual demands.
""Our charges allege that these housing managers used their authority to exploit women whose families were one step away from homelessness"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, ""These violent acts are compounded because they took place at home, leaving these mothers with no safe place to go. I will use all the power of my office to address these violations and protect women from harassment.""
In the West Virginia case, HUD charged a management company and three former employees that managed an apartment complex in Cross Lanes with allegedly sexually harassing at least five women who lived there. The property receives Low-Income Housing Tax Credits and accepts HUD Housing Choice Vouchers (Section 8.)
HUD's charge alleges that the manager of the property threatened to evict two women if they didn't comply with his sexual demands. In one instance, the manager used his keys to break into her apartment and demand that she have sex with him or lose her home and her Section 8 voucher. With her children sleeping in the apartment, the woman felt she could not refuse. In another case, a second tenant allegedly complied with the manager's sexual demand after he threatened, falsely, to take her Section 8 voucher and to make her and her children homeless if she didn't agree to his demands. HUD's charge also alleges that the employee made unwelcome sexual advances toward and sent sexually explicit and unwelcome text messages and graphic pictures to female tenants.
HUD's charge further alleges that an employee sexually harassed female tenants during maintenance visits, including exposing himself and making sexually explicit comments. A site manager at the property who was married to the maintenance employee allegedly failed to report the sexual harassment complaints she received from female tenants.
In a separate case in west Tennessee, HUD charged the manager of a mobile home rental property with sexually harassing a woman who was renting the home.
In her complaint to HUD, the single mother alleged that the manager made repeated requests to take sexually suggestive photographs of her and propositioned her for sex. After numerous requests for photographs, the manager allegedly told the woman that he would forgive a month's rent if she allowed him to take nude photographs of her. When she refused, the manager allegedly texted her that she would receive a 30-day notice to vacate and that she was to ""get the hell out."" In response to the manager's actions and because she feared for her and her children's safety in her own home, the woman moved out a few weeks later.
A United States Administrative Law Judge will hear the charges unless any party to the charges elects to have the case heard in federal district court.
Persons who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY).

10/09/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-124.cfm,HUD Announces $5 Million Wells Fargo Settlement after Complaints of Discrimination Against Women on Maternity Leave or Pregnant,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced that it has reached a $5 million settlement with Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, the nation's largest provider of home mortgage loans, resolving allegations that the lender discriminated against women who were pregnant, or had recently given birth, and were on maternity leave. Under its authority to enforce the Fair Housing Act, HUD has conducted an intensive campaign to end maternity leave-related lending discrimination. Since 2010, 190 maternity leave discrimination complaints have been filed with HUD, resulting in more than 40 settlements for a total of nearly $1.5 million, prior to today's settlement.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to discriminate in real estate related transactions, including the provision of home mortgage loans, on the bases of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, disability, or familial status.
""The settlement is significant for the six families who had the courage to file complaints, and for countless other families who will no longer fear losing out on a home simply because they are expecting a baby,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""I'm committed to leveling the playing field for all families when it comes to mortgage lending. These types of settlements get us closer to ensuring that no qualified family will be singled out for discrimination.""
In today's settlement, the lender will distribute a total of $165,000 among six affected families; create a fund with at least $3.5 million to compensate other Wells Fargo applicants who experienced discrimination because they were pregnant or on maternity leave when they applied for a loan; and pay as many as 175 claimants $20,000 each. If there are more than 175 successful claimants, Wells Fargo will replenish the fund with $1.5 million, and pay each of the next 75 claimants $20,000 each. Claimants beyond 250 will share a prorated share of $5 million. Wells Fargo will also change its underwriting guidelines when it comes to evaluating mortgage loan applications from those on maternity leave, ensuring they are not discriminatory.
This settlement resolves complaints filed by six families from across the nation - including Nevada, Nebraska, Texas, Arizona, and California. A complaint from HUD Assistant Secretary Gustavo Velasquez on behalf of other families is also part of the settlement. Each complaint alleged that Wells Fargo's underwriting policy for its FHA-insured home mortgage loans and the implementation of its policy violated the Fair Housing Act by discriminating against women on maternity leave. The complaints included allegations that Wells Fargo discriminated in lending services in connection with home sales, by making loans unavailable based on sex and familial status; or by forcing women applicants to sacrifice their maternity leave and return to work prior to closing on their loan; and by making discriminatory statements to and against women who were pregnant or who had recently given birth. Women applicants who sacrificed their maternity leave in order to ensure that their loan closed reported emotional distress at the loss of time with their infants and complications that arose in finding emergency child care and establishing the ability to nurse.
Since 2010, HUD has focused on ending maternity leave-related lending discrimination. One of HUD's first cases resulted in a Department of Justice settlement with Mortgage Guarantee Insurance Corporation (MGIC), the nation's largest mortgage insurance provider, which established a $511,250 fund to compensate 70 people, and pay a $38,750 civil penalty. Other settlements include a November 2013 settlement with Bank of America for $45,000 and a 2011 settlement with Cornerstone bank for $750,000.
In addition to the monetary relief announced today, Wells Fargo agreed to implement new Temporary Leave Underwriting Guidelines and issue instructions to its staff about how to implement the guidelines. The new guidelines clarify how Wells Fargo underwriters must evaluate and process mortgage loan applications from applicants on parental leave, including maternity leave, when they apply for a loan.
Persons who believe they have experienced discrimination or believe they may be a potential claimant under the Wells Fargo compensation fund for maternity lending discrimination may contact HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY).

HUD's Jobs-Plus Pilot Program is designed to support work readiness and job placement efforts as well as connecting public housing residents with local employers.
HUD Secretary Julián Castro announced the available funding during a walking tour of a Central Falls, Rhode Island neighborhood.
""HUD is always looking for innovative ways to help families secure new opportunities and reach their full potential,"" said Secretary Castro. ""This funding uses housing as a platform for success by linking public housing residents with the resources they need to access better paying jobs. HUD has a unique role to play in helping folks better their lives. In addition to helping folks secure decent, affordable housing, we are committed to ensuring that their housing serves as a springboard to success.""
With HUD approaching its 50th anniversary next year, Secretary Castro is focused on advancing policies that create opportunities for all Americans by creating jobs.
The Jobs-Plus Pilot Program capitalizes on a successful demonstration (www.mdrc.org/publication/jobs-plus-promising-strategy) program that combines traditional employment, training and job placement services with a rent incentive and a place-based investment in building ""community support for work."" The program model, which requires PHAs to partner with Department of Labor American Jobs Centers promotes initiatives to improve employment and earnings outcomes, a critical element of self-sufficiency for all families. Targeting an entire development helps residents support each other through the process."

Read a complete project-by-project summary of the programs awarded grants today.
The competitive grants are funded through HUD's Fair Housing Initiatives Program (FHIP) to help enforce the Fair Housing Act through investigations and testing of alleged discriminatory practices, and to help educate housing providers, local governments and potential victims of housing discrimination about their rights and responsibilities under the Fair Housing Act.
""Ending housing discrimination is at the core of HUD's mission and it takes dedicated people on the ground to address it,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""These funds support community-based organizations that do great work every day on the front lines in the fight for fairness and equality in our nation's housing market.""
HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity Gustavo Velasquez added, ""The Fair Housing Initiatives Program provides the only federal grant support to private fair housing enforcement and education. Dispersed throughout the country, these grants enable our partner agencies to stand beside us in the fight against housing discrimination, and we couldn't do it without them.""
With HUD approaching its 50th anniversary next year, Secretary Castro is focused on advancing policies that level the playing fields for all Americans by combating housing discrimination.
The categories of grants awarded today are:
Private Enforcement Initiative grants (PEI) - HUD awarded $29.2 million to help local non-profit fair housing organizations carry out testing and enforcement activities to prevent or eliminate discriminatory housing practices.

That's among the findings of the 2013 American Housing Survey being released today by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Census Bureau.
This report marks the 40th year the American Housing Survey (AHS) has been taking a deep look at the U.S. housing stock including detailed information on housing costs and quality. The 2013 AHS, includes new information about neighborhood social life, use of public transportation, and the extent to which American families are prepared for disaster. The 2013 survey includes the following findings:
Neighborhood Social Life
82.4% of households report talking to their neighbor with the past month. 50.7% strongly agree they get along with their neighbors. 49.7% are very willing to help their neighbors.

Characteristics of U.S. homes
There were nearly 133 million total housing units in the U.S. in 2013, 87% of which were occupied. This represents an increase of 413,000 since 2011. 65% of all housing units were occupied by owners in 2011; 35% were occupied by renters. As of 2013, the median size of all single-family detached housing units was 1,800 square feet with a median lot size of .25 acres (compared to .36 acres in 1973). Approximately two-thirds of all housing units used warm-air furnaces for heating; 12.1% used an electric heat pump; and 10.4% used steam/radiant heating. The most common cooking fuel is electricity (61.2%) followed by natural gas/propane (38.7%). Between 2011 and 2013, there was a slight decline in the number of homes experiencing moderate or severe physical problems (including plumbing, heating, and electrical). In 2013, there were nearly 2 million homes with severe physical problems and nearly 4 million housing units with moderate physical problems. 10.3% of all households reported seeing signs of cockroaches within the prior 12 months. 9.1% of households reported evidence of mice in the last 12 months.

EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take two months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, 4 months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2%) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90-percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised about three percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found on our web site listed above.
* 90% confidence interval includes zero. The Census Bureau does not have sufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero.

10/22/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-132.cfm,"HUD Secretary Julián Castro, Senator Heidi Heitkamp Visit Turtle Mountain, Williston to View Firsthand Unique Housing Needs in Indian Country and Western North Dakota","WASHINGTON - Today, Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Julián Castro, and U.S. Senator Heidi Heitkamp visited Belcourt to view housing challenges with black mold and overcrowding on the Turtle Mountain reservation, and toured Williston to examine the city's rapidly expanding housing and infrastructure developments.
During the visit, Castro and Heitkamp announced two major HUD initiatives to help improve some of the state's unique and diverse housing challenges. By the end of the year, HUD will make $6 million in competitive grants available for the Indian Community Development Block Grant (ICDBG) program, a community building initiative that will assist with mold remediation on tribal lands. HUD has also approved emergency waivers for Fair Market Rents (FMRs) (www.heitkamp.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/bd5936e9-e8c4-4577-8d68-54f39eabdeb7/doc-fmr.pdf) - affordable housing rates for low-income households - in nine western North Dakota counties, providing public housing authorities with more flexibility to meet the needs of local residents.
These initiatives will help address some of the dire health conditions experienced in some tribal homes as a result of black mold growth, as well as concerns with a lack of affordable options available for low-income families who struggle to find adequate or available housing in western North Dakota that is within federal market rate restrictions.
""Housing provides the foundation for families to build a better life,"" said Secretary Castro. ""We are focused on addressing the affordable housing crisis and today's action will give public housing authorities in this region the flexibility they need to help low-income families afford a place to rent. We are also partnering with tribal communities to ensure no child or person gets sick in their own home. That is why today we are proud to announce a new set of grants to help tribal communities eliminate and prevent mold in their homes. HUD plays an important role in expanding opportunity for all and we will continue to partner with local leaders, including Senator Heitkamp, to ensure that this community continues to thrive.""
""Addressing North Dakota's complex housing challenges requires strong federal partners who have seen what it's really like for our families on the ground,"" said Heitkamp. ""That's why I am so grateful to Secretary Castro for accepting my invitation to come to North Dakota to see firsthand the severe issues our Native tribes are dealing with in terms of rampant overcrowding, and health hazardous black mold. As I stressed to him this summer, the vast population and housing expansions in Williston are presenting new infrastructure challenges - and I'm glad he made a point of seeing it in person. Secretary Castro's announcements today of $6 million in funding for black mold remediation on our tribal lands, as well as HUD's emergency waiver for Fair Market Rents in nine of our western counties show that he is committed to setting a foundation for a long-lasting relationship with North Dakota, and I look forward to building that relationship for the future of our growing state.""
Heitkamp invited Castro to visit North Dakota in June (www.heitkamp.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2014/7/heitkamp-votes-to-confirm-hud-secretary-urges-him-to-visit-north-dakota-to-see-state-s-housing-needs-firsthand) to view North Dakota's urgent and complex housing.

10/23/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-130.cfm,U.S. Announces Settlement with Cincinnati Landlord - 224 Housing Units to Become Lead Safe,"CINCINNATI - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Ohio, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) today announced a settlement against a Cincinnati landlord for failing to inform tenants that their homes may contain potentially dangerous lead. The agreement requires Meyer Management, Inc. to replace windows and clean up lead-based paint hazards in 136 residential properties containing a total of 224 units (see attached list). In addition to the $350,000 worth of lead abatement work being performed, the company also agrees to pay civil penalties totaling $7,500.
According to the Federal Government,Meyer Management, Inc. violated the Federal Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act (Residential Lead Act) by failing to inform tenants that their homes may contain potentially dangerous levels of lead. Cincinnati health department officials identified at least 5 children with elevated blood lead levels in the properties. Lead inspections and risk assessments had been performed in additional units, such that Meyer Management, Inc. had specific knowledge of lead in as many as 21 of the units in its properties. Going forward, Meyer Management, Inc. will ensure that information about lead-based paint will be provided to tenants before they are obligated under their lease.
As a result of the settlement, Meyer Management, Inc. will perform lead-based paint hazard reduction work, including window replacement and abatement of all friction and impact surfaces, and clearance exams within a period of six years to make those units lead safe for families. In addition, Meyer Management, Inc. will pay a $7,500 civil money penalty.
""Children should be protected from lead's destructive and permanent effects,"" said Matt Ammon, Director of HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes. ""We hope this settlement serves as a reminder to housing providers to do the right thing and let families who rent know about lead in their homes so they can protect their children from its hazards.""
""Through these enforcement actions, EPA is sending a clear message to landlords and property managers that protecting children from exposure to lead-based paint is one of our highest priorities,"" EPA Region 5 Administrator Susan Hedman said.
""This case illustrates the continued commitment by health officials and federal agencies to protect families' rights to a safe living environment,"" said U.S. Attorney Carter Stewart. ""I commend the cooperative investigation.""
The settlement announced today represents the third joint Residential Lead Act enforcement action in Cincinnati and was the result of intensive coordination among local health officials and federal investigators. HUD, EPA and the Department of Justice are continuing similar enforcement efforts around the nation, and so far have taken enforcement actions in which landlords have agreed to conduct lead-based paint hazard reduction in more than 186,745 apartments and pay $1,466,399 in civil penalties. In addition, a total of $703,750 has been provided by Defendants to community-based projects to reduce lead poisoning. In settling these cases, landlords have committed to expend more than an estimated $31 million to address lead-based paint hazards in the affected units.
Background
The Residential Lead Act is one of the primary federal enforcement tools to prevent lead poisoning in young children. The Lead Disclosure Rule requires home sellers and landlords of housing built before 1978 to disclose to purchasers and tenants knowledge of lead-based paint or lead-based paint hazards using a disclosure form, signed by both parties, attached to the sales contract or lease containing the required lead warning statement, provide any available records or reports, and provide an EPA-approved ""Protect Your Family From Lead in Your Home"" pamphlet. Sellers must also provide purchasers with an opportunity to conduct a lead-based paint inspection and/or risk assessment at the purchaser's expense. Acceptable lead disclosure forms can be found at http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/healthy_homes/enforcement/disclosure.
Health Effects of Lead-Based Paint
Lead exposure causes reduced IQ, learning disabilities, developmental delays, reduced height, poorer hearing, and a host of other health problems in young children. Many of these effects are thought to be irreversible. In later years, lead-poisoned children are much more likely to drop out of school, become juvenile delinquents and engage in criminal and other anti-social behavior. As reported in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers found that even at low levels, lead exposure in children can significantly impact IQ and even delay puberty in young girls.
At higher levels, lead can damage a child's kidneys and central nervous system and cause anemia, coma, convulsions and even death. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 4 million households have children living in them that are being exposed to high levels of lead. There are approximately half a million U.S. children ages 1-5 with blood lead levels above 5 micrograms per deciliter (µg/dL), the reference level at which CDC recommends public health actions be initiated.
Eliminating lead-based paint hazards in older low-income housing is essential if childhood lead poisoning is to be eradicated. According to CDC estimates, the percentage of children with elevated blood lead levels has been cut in half since the early 1990's, although as many as 1 million children are still affected by lead poisoning today. HUD estimates that the number of houses with lead paint has declined from 64 million in 1990 to 38 million in 2000. About 24 million homes still have significant lead-based paint hazards."

EXPLANATORY NOTES
These statistics are estimated from sample surveys. They are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated average relative standard errors of the preliminary data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2%) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90-percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant.

The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. Changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show irregular movement. It takes three months to establish a trend for new houses sold.
Preliminary new home sales figures are subject to revision due to the survey methodology and definitions used. The survey is primarily based on a sample of houses selected from building permits. Since a ""sale"" is defined as a deposit taken or sales agreement signed, this can occur prior to a permit being issued. An estimate of these prior sales is included in the sales figure. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimate of total sales is revised about three percent. Changes in sales price data reflect changes in the distribution of houses by region, size, etc., as well as changes in the prices of houses with identical characteristics. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found on our web site listed above.

10/30/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-135.cfm,HUD Reports Homelessness in U.S. Continues to Decline,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro today announced HUD's latest estimate of homelessness in the U.S., noting a continued general decline and specifically among veterans and persons living on the street. HUD's 2014 Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress (https://www.hudexchange.info/resources/documents/2014-AHAR-Part1.pdf) finds that there were 578,424 persons experiencing homelessness on a single night in 2014. This represents an overall 10 percent reduction and 25 percent drop in the unsheltered population since 2010, the year the Obama Administration launched Opening Doors (http://usich.gov/opening_doors/), the nation's first comprehensive strategy to prevent and end homelessness.
HUD's annual 'point-in-time' estimates seek to measure the scope of homelessness on a single night in January. Based on data reported by state and local planning agencies, last January's one-night estimate reveals a 33 percent drop in homelessness among veterans, including a 43 percent reduction in unsheltered homelessness among veterans, since 2010 and a 10.5 percent decline since last year. State and local communities also reported a 15 percent decline in the number of families with children experiencing homelessness since 2010, as well as a 53 percent reduction among these families who were found be to unsheltered.
""As a nation, we are successfully reducing homelessness in this country, especially for those who have been living on our streets as a way of life,"" said Castro. ""There is still a tremendous amount of work ahead of us but it's clear our strategy is working and we're going to push forward till we end homelessness as we've come to know it.""
""The federal government, in partnership with states, communities, and the private and not-for-profit sectors, is focused on widespread implementation of what works to end homelessness,"" said Laura Green Zeilinger, executive director of the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness. ""Continued investments in solutions like permanent supportive housing and rapid re-housing using a Housing First approach is critical to the effort of every community to one day ensure homelessness is a rare, brief, and non-recurring experience.""
During one night in late January of 2014, volunteers across the nation conducted a count of their local sheltered and unsheltered homeless populations. These one-night 'snapshot' counts are then reported to HUD as part of state and local grant applications. While the data reported to HUD does not directly determine the level of a community's grant funding, these estimates, as well as full-year counts, are crucial in understanding the scope of homelessness and measuring progress in reducing it.
The Obama Administration's strategic plan to end homelessness is called Opening Doors - a roadmap for joint action by the 19 federal member agencies of the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness along with local and state partners in the public and private sectors. The Plan puts the country on a path to end homelessness among veterans by 2015; chronic homelessness by 2016; and to ending homelessness among children, family, and youth by 2020. The Plan presents strategies building upon the lesson that mainstream housing, health, education, and human service programs must be fully engaged and coordinated to prevent and end homelessness.
The decline in veteran homelessness is largely attributed to the close collaboration between HUD and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs on a joint program called HUD-VA Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH). Since 2008, more than 59,000 rental vouchers have been awarded and approximately 45,000 formerly homeless veterans are currently in homes of their own because of HUD-VASH.
Long-term or chronic homelessness among individuals is declining quite substantially since 2010. This decline is partially attributable to a concerted effort to make available more permanent supportive housing opportunities for people with disabling health conditions who otherwise continually remain in shelters or on the streets. Research demonstrates that for those experiencing chronic homelessness, providing permanent housing coupled with appropriate supportive services without treatment preconditions, is the most effective solution for ending homelessness. This 'housing first' approach also saves the taxpayer considerable money by interrupting a costly cycle of emergency room and hospital, detox, and even jail visits.
Many communities are also making a special effort to identify youth experiencing homelessness on the night of their counts. Great strides have been made connecting young people to youth service providers, with particularly strong efforts focused on youth experiencing homelessness who are unsheltered. In addition, communities are finding creative ways to identify and engage these unsheltered youth, through efforts like youth-targeted events to more intentional use of social media outlets.

Designed for economic revitalization, the Network is a first of its kind effort to bring together national experts under one organization to work with cities seeking to increase their economic competitiveness and to reverse population decline, job loss and high rates of poverty.
""Knowledge is fuel for progress and innovation,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""The National Resource Network will be a valuable tool in helping local governments address their challenges and achieve their goals. It will provide on-the-ground technical assistance and human resources that cities can use to build for the future. Working together as partners, I know we'll expand opportunities for more Americans.""
The Network is led by a consortium selected by the federal government because of its members' expertise and experience as national leaders in assisting cities in efforts to overcome challenges related to economic development, community development and fiscal and operational issues. The Network also includes more than a dozen strategic partners with experience and expertise in criminal justice, education, workforce development and other policy areas.
""By bringing together the best thinking about cities from experts that work with cities every day, the National Resource Network will support Mayors, City Managers and city leaders doing the hard work to overcome economic challenges and increase economic competitiveness,"" said David Eichenthal, Executive Director of the National Resource Network.
City governments can submit an application to receive assistance from the Network by completing an on-line form at http://nationalresourcenetwork.org/en/solutions/rfa. Eligibility for the Network is based on economic and demographic criteria. Approximately 275 cities are eligible to apply. Applications will be accepted and reviewed on a rolling basis.
Among many factors, the Network will heavily consider whether a city's request has high-level executive sponsorship in the city government and whether the city government has enlisted other community stakeholders in its planning effort. Applications that would benefit regions or multiple cities are strongly encouraged.
The Network is expected to provide on-the-ground assistance to dozens of eligible cities by 2016. Eight pilot cities are currently participating in the Network: Compton and Lynwood, CA; Kansas City, KS; Jackson and Meridian, MS; Miami, FL; Anderson, IN; and Fall River, MA.
The National Resource Network is a component of the Strong Cities, Strong Communities Initiative, and was funded by $10 million from HUD. The Network was created out of demand from cities around the country to have access to experts, technical advice, and information that can help them address the mounting challenges of growing inequality, high unemployment, under-performing schools, aging infrastructure and vacant and blighted properties.
The Network consortium consists of the following private and public sector organizations:

10/31/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-137.cfm,HUD Charges Owner of Maryland Housing Complex with Discriminating Against Victim of Domestic Violence,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has charged Southgate Apartment Company and A & G Management Company, the owner and property manager of Southgate Apartments and Townhomes in Glen Burnie, Maryland, with violating the Fair Housing Act by refusing to renew the lease of a female tenant and her two sons after she and her older son were stabbed by her then boyfriend.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to terminate an individual's housing because of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, disability, or familial status.
""Survivors of domestic violence, who often have to fight for their lives, shouldn't have to fight to keep their housing,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD is committed to working to ensure that women and children are not unlawfully forced from their homes because they were physically abused.""
According to HUD's charge, the woman had resided with her two sons in the apartment complex for several years without incident. One evening, her then boyfriend came to her unit and, after a brief argument, stabbed the woman and her 18-year-old son, who had attempted to aid his mother. The woman spent several days in a hospital as a result of her injuries. Shortly after she was released from the hospital, the property manager of Southgate Apartments issued her a 30-day notice to vacate, which asserted that she had violated her lease because police had to be called to her home in response to ""domestic issues and weapons being discharged."" The owner and property manager later refused to renew the family's lease.
Following the incident, the woman enlisted the help of Maryland Legal Aid, a nonprofit law firm that provides a range of free civil legal services (www.mdlab.org/get-help-services/) to financially qualified residents of Maryland, and subsequently filed a complaint with HUD.
October is National Domestic Violence Awareness Month.
A United States Administrative Law Judge will hear the charge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court.
Persons who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed at www.hud.gov/fairhousing or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, which can be accessed through Apple devices, such as the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch."
11/03/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-138.cfm,"HUD Charges, Reaches Settlements with Housing Providers in Alabama, California, Michigan and New Hampshire After Complaints Alleging Discrimination Against Residents with Disabilities","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has charged housing providers operating in California and New Hampshire, and reached settlement agreements with providers in Alabama and Michigan amid allegations that they discriminated against residents with disabilities.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to discriminate in the sale, rental, and financing of dwellings, and in other housing-related transactions, based on disability. This includes discriminating against any person in the terms, conditions, or privileges of sale or rental of a home, or in services or facilities related to the housing, because of a disability. Among the acts prohibited is refusing to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services.
""We continue to see more cases of discrimination against persons with disabilities than any other type,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""It is unacceptable that individuals with disabilities have to fight for the opportunity to live where they want, or to have reasonable accommodations extended to them so they can enjoy their dwelling. The cases we're announcing today reflect our ongoing commitment to leveling the playing field for all Americans when it comes to housing.""
In 2013, almost 54 percent of the complaints filed with HUD (4,426) alleged housing discrimination based on disability. The two charges and two settlements announced today are:
Alabama
HUD has reached a Conciliation Agreement with Chapel Creek Residential Association, Inc., of Birmingham, AL, after a married couple filed a complaint alleging that the association unreasonably delayed and/or constructively denied their request for approval of disability-related modifications needed for their home because the husband uses a wheelchair. The couple will receive $42,290 in compensation, and the homeowner association will develop reasonable accommodation/modification policies and procedures that are consistent with the Fair Housing Act.
California
HUD charged the owners of an apartment complex in San Francisco with discrimination for initially refusing to allow a tenant with disabilities to keep an emotional support animal. Even after the tenant presented the owners with medical documentation attesting to her need for the animal, the owners refused to grant her reasonable accommodation request. As a result of the refusal, the tenant sent the animal to live with a friend. The owners ultimately granted the tenant the accommodation, but only after the tenant was forced to live without her support animal for approximately five months, which doctors say caused psychological duress.
Michigan
HUD reached a Conciliation Agreement with Huntington Management, operators of five ""independent living"" properties in southeast Michigan known as Oakmont Senior Communities, settling allegations that it terminated a woman from her job at one of the properties because she raised fair housing concerns about the company's policy of monitoring the health of applicants and residents. The agreement is the first HUD enforcement action involving independent living properties in Michigan. The woman, who will receive $35,000 in compensation, worked with the Fair Housing Center of Metropolitan Detroit (FHCMD), a non-profit fair housing organization that receives HUD funding, to file the complaint. Fair housing testers with FHCMD found practices that included the regular and uniform collection of medical data of applicants and current residents and ""gate-keeping"" practices in which residents who had to leave their units for hospital stays were not allowed to return or remain in their units once they were deemed not ""independent"" enough. In addition to compensating the woman, Huntington will alter its policies to no longer require residents returning from hospital stays to undergo a ""gatekeeping review"" or provide medical information.
New Hampshire
HUD charged Midridge Condominium Association, the owners of a condominium complex in Londonderry, NH, and Avatar Properties, Inc., the management company for the complex, as well as five members of the condominium association and two individuals who worked for the management company with violating the Fair Housing Act when they denied a resident with disabilities' request to be allowed to use the visitor parking space in front of his unit as a reasonable accommodation. The designated parking space that had been assigned to the resident, who has difficulty climbing stairs, was behind his building and could only be accessed via a staircase with nine steps.
A United States Administrative Law Judge will hear the charged cases except in those instances in which a party to the charge elected to have the case heard in federal district court.
Persons who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to www.hud.gov/fairhousing, or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, which can be accessed through Apple devices, such as the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch."
11/03/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-139.cfm,HUD Order Resolves Allegations that American Bank Discriminated Against Loan Applicant with Disabilities,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has entered into an Initial Decision and Consent Order with American Bank, resolving HUD's charge that the Rockville, Maryland-based lender discriminated against applicants with disabilities when it allegedly required applicants to provide documentation regarding their disabilities and attempted to obtain information about the nature and extent of those disabilities.
The Fair Housing Act makes it illegal to discriminate in the terms and conditions of a loan to an individual based on a disability, including imposing different application or qualification criteria. The Fair Housing Act also makes it illegal to inquire about the nature or severity of a disability except in limited circumstances.
""Holding homebuyers with disabilities to a higher standard is against the law,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Banks may verify income, but they cannot single out homebuyers with disabilities and delay or deny their financing, if they are otherwise eligible.""
The Initial Decision and Consent Order was entered after HUD charged the lender with unlawful discrimination based on disability. A Pierpont, South Dakota, couple filed a complaint with HUD alleging that the bank required the husband, who has a permanent disability, to provide Social Security Administration documentation proving his disability-related income for the past two years. The letter the man provided had no end date, and stated that his disability income would continue unless the man's medical condition improved. However, the bank, and its senior mortgage banker, allegedly required such loan applicants with disabilities to provide additional medical documentation proving that they would continue to receive disability income for at least three years.
The couple's complaint further alleged that the bank required the husband to provide the name and phone number of his physician so it could inquire about the status of the husband's disability and whether or not he would get better. The man's doctor subsequently provided a letter stating that the man's condition is a ""permanent condition"" and that he ""will suffer from the effects of this condition for the remainder of his life.""
During its investigation leading to the charge, HUD determined that at least five other loan applicants with disabilities had faced similar barriers when applying for mortgage loans with American Bank. A complaint by HUD Assistant Secretary Velasquez was filed on behalf of other families and is also resolved by the Order.
Under the Initial Decision and Consent Order, American Bank will pay the couple $25,000, adopt a written policy addressing the income verification requirements for home mortgage loan applicants who receive disability income, and provide fair lending training, including training regarding disability income, to newly hired employees. The Bank will also identify the approximately 2,900 applicants that applied for a loan to purchase or refinance a home between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2013, and listed Social Security Disability Insurance, Social Security, and/or short-term or long-term disability insurance as a source of income. A third-party administrator hired by the bank will review each application file and identify everyone the bank required to provide information about their medical conditions for income verification purposes. Those applicants may be eligible to receive up to $5,500 in compensatory damages.
Persons who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY).

11/03/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-140.cfm,HUD Settles Claims Alleging Owner of DeKalb Apartment Complex Discriminated Against Persons with Disabilities,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has entered into a Voluntary Compliance Agreement (VCA) with University Village, the owner and operator of a 500-unit HUD-subsidized apartment complex in DeKalb, Illinois. As part of the agreement, University Village has agreed to pay $255,000 to settle allegations that it violated fair housing laws when it failed to meet the needs of persons with disabilities and retaliated against a resident with disabilities for requesting a reasonable accommodation.
The VCA is the result of complaints that were filed by HOPE Fair Housing Center, the RAMP Center for Independent Living and two residents with disabilities, which alleged that University Village made housing unavailable when it assigned a mobility impaired resident to a third-floor unit in a building with no elevator, and threatened her with eviction for having her adult daughter, who was serving as her caregiver, in the unit, even though she had documentation verifying her disability and need for the accommodation. University Village receives federal financial assistance from HUD in the form of project-based vouchers.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in the sale or rental of a dwelling because of disability, including refusing to make reasonable accommodations in policies or practices when a person with a disability requires such an accommodation. In addition, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 requires that programs or activities receiving federal financial assistance be readily accessible to persons with disabilities and that they be granted the reasonable accommodations they need, including being allowed to have a live-in caregiver in a unit when it is necessary.
""No one with a disability should be denied the accommodations they need to fully enjoy their home,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""This agreement reflects HUD's commitment to working with housing providers, including owners of HUD funded housing, to meet their obligation to comply with the nation's fair housing laws.""
Under the terms of the agreement, University Village will pay $255,000, which includes attorney fees, to the two individuals who filed complaints and work with HOPE Fair Housing Center to develop a new reasonable accommodation policy. The complex will also conduct a needs assessment of current tenants and applicants who require assessable units to determine if their needs are being met and ensure that five percent of its units are fully accessible, either by constructing new units or converting existing units."
11/12/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-141.cfm,"HUD, Salvation Army Settle Pregnancy Discrimination Claims","WASHINGTON, DC - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that the Salvation Army will pay $48,000 to four women as part of a Conciliation Agreement resolving allegations that the international charitable organization wrongfully evicted them from its Turning Point transitional housing center in Washington, DC, because they became pregnant. Salvation Army also agreed to set aside $24,000 for a housing case manager.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to discriminate in housing based on a person's race, color, national origin, religion, sex, disability, and familial status. This includes discriminating against families with children under 18 years old, women who are pregnant, and persons who are attempting to secure legal custody of a child under 18.
""Transitional housing centers are essential to helping individuals move from homelessness into stable housing situations,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, ""but it is both wrong and illegal to evict women because they become pregnant.""
The Conciliation Agreement is the result of a Secretary-initiated complaint that HUD filed against the Salvation Army after an investigation determined that the Turning Point Center's residency rules unlawfully discriminated against residents on the basis of sex and familial status. The center accepted pregnant women and women with children, but evicted women who became pregnant during the term of their residency. The Salvation Army's Turning Point Center maintained a policy that said ""there are to be no additions to a resident's family while she is enrolled in the Turning Point Program. Pregnancy, regardless of outcome, will be grounds for dismissal from the program.""
Under the terms of the Conciliation Agreement,the Turning Point Center will revise its residency policies to allow women who become pregnant after entering the program to complete their stay. The Salvation Army will also pay $12,000 to each of four women who were pregnant at the time they were evicted from the Turning Point Center. In addition, the Salvation Army will allocate $24,000 to the operating budget of the Turning Point Center to hire a part-time case manager to assist women with moving to housing after completing the center's two-year program.
Persons who believe they have experienced discrimination under the Fair Housing Act may contact HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY).

11/12/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-142.cfm,HUD Finds that Puerto Rico Condo Association Discriminated Against Resident with Disabilities,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today it has ordered Castillo Condominium Association, in San Juan, Puerto Rico, to pay $20,000 in damages plus a $16,000 civil penalty after finding that the association violated the Fair Housing Act when it refused to allow a resident with disabilities to keep his emotional support animal.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to refuse to make reasonable accommodations in policies or practices when such an accommodation may be necessary to afford a person with a disability equal opportunity to use and enjoy his or her home. This includes refusing to grant waivers to ""no-pet"" policies for persons who use assistance or support animals.
""Assistance animals are not pets. Persons with disabilities often depend on them in order carry out life's daily functions,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""This Order reaffirms HUD's commitment to taking appropriate action when federal fair housing law has been violated.""
The case came to HUD's attention when a resident of Castillo Condominiums filed a complaint alleging that the condominium's homeowner association discriminated against him when it denied his request to keep an emotional support animal in his unit, even though he presented documentation from his healthcare provider identifying his disability and his need for the animal. Pets were allowed when the resident initially bought his unit in 1995, but the condominium association had adopted a ""no-pets"" policy before the resident adopted his emotional support animal. As a result of being denied the right to have a support animal, the man experienced depression and anxiety and he was forced to sell the home he had lived in for almost 20 years.
HUD's Order modifies a previous HUD Administrative Law Judge decision that ordered Castillo Condominium Association to pay only $3,000 in emotional distress damages and a $2,000 civil penalty. The HUD order ruled that a higher damages award and civil penalty are necessary in light of the seriousness of the violation and complainant's injuries.

11/17/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-143.cfm,FHA Issues Annual Financial Status Report to Congress,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today released its annual report to Congress on the financial condition of the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) Mutual Mortgage Insurance (MMI) Fund. The independent actuarial report shows that FHA's Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMIF) has improved going from a negative value to a growth of $21 billion within two years. Read a comprehensive summary of the report released today.
The Fund gained nearly $6 billion in value over the last year and now stands at $4.8 billion. The current capital ratio is .41 percent. Improvement in the Fund is a result of aggressive policy actions that have led to better portfolio performance including delinquency rates dropping 14 percent and recovery rates improving by 16 percent since last year.
""This year's report shows that the fundamentals of the Fund are strong,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""Over the past five years, FHA has taken a number of prudent actions to restore the Fund's fiscal health. This is positive news for the economy and the millions of American families that count on FHA.""
Following the housing crisis, FHA took a number of steps including changes to underwriting standards, loss mitigation policies, recovery strategies and premium levels. All of these actions combined have led to the results seen today.
""Improving the performance of the Fund by $21 billion in two years is good news for the housing market,"" said Acting FHA Commissioner Biniam Gebre. ""FHA will continue to focus on meeting its mission of creating responsible access, investing in our economy and preserving pathways to the middle class. We remain dedicated to giving more hard-working responsible families the chance to buy a home and not a returning to the days of reckless lending that caused so much pain for middle-class families and the economy.""
Across a number of measures, the portfolio has seen significant improvements, including:
$40 Billion in available cash reserves
• $40 Billion in available cash reserves
$10 Billion of additional economic value added each year
• $10 Billion of additional economic value added each year
30% drop in seriously delinquent rates
• 30% drop in seriously delinquent rates
68% Improvement in recovery rates
• 68% Improvement in recovery rates
63% Reduction in foreclosure starts
• 63% Reduction in foreclosure starts
85% Drop in early payment defaults
• 85% Drop in early payment defaults
The report makes clear that the steps this Administration has taken to improve the health of the Fund are taking hold. As the Fund has improved, FHA has been able to focus on helping responsible families get a loan in today's tight lending environment. FHA will continue to execute on the policies that have supported both the turnaround in the Fund and an appropriate expansion of credit access to the underserved.
Read a comprehensive briefing on the Independent Actuary's Report and FHA's Financial Outlook.
The FHA's Role in the Housing Market
The FHA was established in response to the failure of the banking system during the Great Depression to help stabilize the economy and the housing market. When the private market couldn't or wouldn't provide access to credit, FHA was there, investing in our economy and preserving pathways to the middle class - just as it was designed to do. During this most recent crisis, FHA experienced a nearly five-fold increase in market share enabling it to provide critical access to credit when most needed. Today, the number of single-family loan endorsements has declined to pre-crisis levels. This decline indicates the housing market and economy are beginning to recover.
During its nearly 80-year history, FHA has helped approximately 40 million Americans purchase or refinance homes—nearly 7 million of those just during the most recent crisis."
11/19/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-144.cfm,HUD and Census Bureau Announce New Residential Construction Activity in October,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Census Bureau today announced the following new residential construction statistics for October 2014:
BUILDING PERMITS
Privately owned housing units authorized by building permits in October were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,080,000. This is 4.8 percent (±1.3%) above the revised September rate of 1,031,000 and is 1.2 percent (±1.2%) above the October 2013 estimate of 1,067,000. Single-family authorizations in October were at a rate of 640,000; this is 1.4 percent (±1.2%) above the revised September figure of 631,000. Authorizations of units in buildings with five units or more were at a rate of 406,000 in October.
HOUSING STARTS
Privately owned housing starts in October were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,009,000. This is 2.8 percent (±10.0%)* below the revised September estimate of 1,038,000, but is 7.8 percent (±8.7%)* above the October 2013 rate of 936,000. Single-family housing starts in October were at a rate of 696,000; this is 4.2 percent (±8.8%)* above the revised September figure of 668,000. The October rate for units in buildings with five units or more was 300,000.
HOUSING COMPLETIONS
Privately owned housing completions in October were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 881,000. This is 8.8 percent (±14.7%)* below the revised September estimate of 966,000, but is 8.1 percent (±13.0%)* above the October 2013 rate of 815,000. Single-family housing completions in October were at a rate of 585,000; this is 7.4 percent (±9.5%)* below the revised September rate of 632,000. The October rate for units in buildings with five units or more was 289,000.
New Residential Construction data for November 2014 will be released on Tuesday, December 16, 2014, at 8:30 A.M. EST. Beginning with the release of the January 2015 data on February 18, 2015, the building permit data will reflect a small increase in the universe of permit-issuing places and will be labeled as the 2014 Universe. These changes will have no effect on the estimates of new housing starts and completions because the increase in the permit universe is offset by a decrease in the universe of areas where permits are not required. Building permit data for 2014 for both universes will be shown in Table 1. New Privately Owned Housing Units Authorized in Permit-Issuing Places of the January 2015 press release.
EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take two months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, 4 months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2%) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90-percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised about three percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found on our web site listed above.
* 90% confidence interval includes zero. The Census Bureau does not have sufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero.

11/20/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-145.cfm,HUD Secretary Castro Offers $30 Million Grants to Help Transform Communities,"AUSTIN, TX - U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Julián Castro today announced funding available to help local communities across the country to redevelop severely distressed public and HUD-assisted housing and transform surrounding neighborhoods. This funding is subject to increase if there is an FY2015 appropriation. Part of the Obama Administration's effort to build Ladders of Opportunity to the middle class, HUD is offering grants of up to $30 million through its Choice Neighborhoods Implementation Program to support locally driven solutions for transforming neighborhoods struggling to address poor quality housing, inadequate schools, poor health, high crime, and lack of capital. Read HUD's funding notice.
Speaking at the annual convention of the National League of Cities (NLC) in Austin, Texas, Castro said the grants will help create jobs, increase economic activity, improve affordable housing, reduce violence and expand educational opportunities. Grantees and their partners use the funds as a catalyst - stimulating approximately $7.50 in public and private investment for every $1 in the Choice Neighborhoods funding.
""These Choice Neighborhood grants will empower local communities to leverage public and private investment and achieve greater collective impact,"" Castro said. ""We look forward to working with community leaders to breathe new life into struggling neighborhoods-and to transform them into places where residents can flourish and dreams can thrive.""
Choice Neighborhoods is HUD's signature place-based initiative and its vision builds on the work that has been done by the Neighborhood Revitalization Initiative, an interagency partnership between HUD, the Department of Education, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice, and Treasury, since 2009. Through a variety of interventions, the Ladders of Opportunity plan will help community partners rebuild neighborhoods, expand early learning opportunities, create pathways to jobs, and strengthen families. Choice Neighborhoods is focused on three core goals:
Housing: Replace distressed public and assisted housing with high-quality mixed-income housing that is well-managed and responsive to the needs of the surrounding neighborhood. People: Improve educational outcomes and intergenerational mobility for youth with services and supports delivered directly to youth and their families. Neighborhood: Create the conditions necessary for public and private reinvestment in distressed neighborhoods to offer the kinds of amenities and assets, including safety, good schools, and commercial activity, that are important to families' choices about their community.
• Housing: Replace distressed public and assisted housing with high-quality mixed-income housing that is well-managed and responsive to the needs of the surrounding neighborhood.
• People: Improve educational outcomes and intergenerational mobility for youth with services and supports delivered directly to youth and their families.
• Neighborhood: Create the conditions necessary for public and private reinvestment in distressed neighborhoods to offer the kinds of amenities and assets, including safety, good schools, and commercial activity, that are important to families' choices about their community.
HUD's commitment to teamwork means local residents and leaders are leading the way in revitalizing their communities. To accomplish these core goals, communities must have in place a comprehensive neighborhood revitalization strategy, or Transformation Plan. This Transformation Plan is the guiding document for the revitalization of the public and/or assisted housing units, while simultaneously directing the transformation of the surrounding neighborhood and positive outcomes for families.
Choice Neighborhoods Implementation grants are available for public housing authorities, local governments, nonprofit organizations, tribal entities, and for profit developers that apply jointly with a public entity to extend neighborhood transformation efforts beyond public and/or assisted housing. The program helps communities transform neighborhoods by revitalizing severely distressed public and/or HUD-assisted multifamily housing and investing and leveraging investments in well-functioning services, high quality public schools and education programs, high quality early learning programs and services, public assets, public transportation, and improved access to jobs.
Today, Choice Neighborhoods Implementation Grantees can be found in cities such as Boston, Columbus, and San Antonio. In Boston, a local community economic development corporation successfully converted a vacant, blighted 36,000 square-foot factory into a food production hub that is expected to bring 50 businesses and 150 jobs to the local neighborhood in its first five years of operation. In Columbus, the City, Housing Authority, and The Ohio State University are now implementing a community driven Transformation Plan with the support of Choice Neighborhoods funds in over $180 million in public and private sources. Finally, cities like San Antonio have leveraged Choice Neighborhoods efforts with federal funding to improve schools and public safety - an effort that has led to a Promise Zones designation.
Applicants must submit a completed electronic application through www.grants.gov by February 9, 2015. More information can be found at www.hud.gov/cn."

To date, more than 255 cities, counties and states are pledging to end veteran homelessness in their communities by 2015 using the power of federal, state, local, and non-profit resources.
Speaking at the annual convention of the National League of Cities in Austin, Texas, Secretary Castro announced the new partnership and signed the official MOU with NLC Executive Director, Clarence Anthony.
""Today's partnership sends a loud message that ending homelessness is not a dream,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""It's a goal within reach for veterans, for youth, for families and for individuals. It's up to us to make it a reality. Working together we can get it done and give every family a home of dignity.""
""We are excited to partner with the Department of Housing and Urban Development on this critical issue facing our veterans,"" said Clarence Anthony, Executive Director of the National League of Cities. He continued, ""Since the beginning of the Mayors Challenge, NLC has worked closely with HUD to engage city leaders. This partnership will expand our efforts to bring a deeper understanding of the resources available to local leaders and assist in creating action plans that will go a long way towards eliminating veteran homelessness.""
The MOU calls for HUD and NLC to jointly develop and execute regional forums to raise the awareness and understanding of the benefits of joining the Mayors Challenge to End Veteran Homelessness. Today's announcement is also the latest step in the Mayors Challenge to End Veteran Homelessness announced by First Lady Michelle Obama in June 2014.
The MOU will make available HUD's resources to:
Prioritize the most vulnerable veterans, especially those experiencing chronic homelessness, for permanent supportive housing opportunities; Coordinate outreach efforts to identify and engage every veteran experiencing homelessness and focus outreach efforts on achieving housing outcomes; Target rapid rehousing interventions, including those made possible through the Department of Veterans Affairs' Supportive Services for Veteran Families program, toward veterans who need shorter-term rental subsidies and services in order to be reintegrated back into our communities; Leverage housing and services resources that can help veterans who are ineligible for some of the VA's programs get into stable housing; Increase early detection and access to preventive services so at-risk veterans remain stably housed; and Closely monitor progress toward the goal, including the success of programs achieving permanent housing outcomes.

12/03/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-148.cfm,"HUD Announces $10 Million in ""Sweat Equity"" Grants","WASHINGTON - U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Julián Castro today awarded $10 million in ""sweat equity"" grants to four non-profit self-help housing organizations which will create at least 540 affordable homes for hard-working, low-income families and individuals. Funded through HUD's Self-Help Homeownership Opportunity Program (SHOP), the funding awarded today, along with the labor contributed by the homebuyers and numerous volunteers, will significantly lower the cost of homeownership.
""These grants will make owning a home a reality for hundreds of working families,"" said HUD Secretary Castro. ""These families will become homeowners not only because of our public investments, but because of their own contributions. Our job is to support sustainable homeownership and these self-help programs do exactly that.""
The following organizations will receive SHOP funds (see individual descriptions below):
Organization
Grant Amount
Community Frameworks
$540,000
Habitat for Humanity International
$6,211,368
Housing Assistance Council
$1,566,000
Tierra del Sol (Western States Housing Consortium)
$1,682,632
TOTAL
$10,000,000
The SHOP program provides federal grants on a competitive basis to national and regional non-profit organizations and consortia that have experience in administering self-help homeownership housing programs. The SHOP grants must be used to purchase land and make necessary infrastructure improvements, which together may not exceed an average SHOP investment of $15,000 per dwelling unit. Leveraged funds must be used for the construction or rehabilitation of these homeownership units.
All newly constructed units will receive certification as ENERGY STAR qualified units. All appliances, products or features that are installed or replaced will be ENERGY STAR qualified. Water usage products will bear the WaterSense label. Many units will also have ""Green,"" ""Healthy Homes,"" and ""Universal Design"" features.
Homebuyers will contribute significant sweat equity toward the development of their units and/or the units of other homebuyers participating in the local self-help housing programs. These sweat equity contributions reduce the purchase price of the SHOP units and make these units affordable for low-income homebuyers. A minimum of 100 sweat equity hours is required from a household of two or more persons. A minimum of 50 sweat equity hours is required from a household of one person. Community participation consisting of volunteer labor contributions is also required. Sweat equity and volunteer labor may include, but are not limited to, landscaping, foundation work, painting, carpentry, trim work, drywall, roofing and siding for the housing. Reasonable accommodations must be made for persons with disabilities.
Grantees may carry out activities directly and/or distribute SHOP funds to local non-profit affiliates that will develop the SHOP units, select homebuyers, coordinate the homebuyer sweat equity and volunteer efforts, and assist in the arrangement of interim and permanent financing for the homebuyers. The grantees ensure that the new homebuyers can afford their homes at the time of purchase and for the long term. Many of the SHOP homebuyers are first-time homeowners and come from underserved groups.
Since 1996, when Congress first appropriated SHOP funds, the SHOP program has provided more than $396 million in federal grants that, together with significant leveraged funds and numerous volunteer hours, are transforming lives and neighborhoods through the production of over 28,500 units of affordable, homeownership housing.

12/04/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-150.cfm,HUD and Treasury Announce Enhancements to Housing Program,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of the Treasury today announced enhancements to programs under Making Home Affordable (MHA) to better assist struggling homeowners and communities still recovering from the effects of the financial crisis. The enhancements are designed to motivate homeowners in MHA to continue making their mortgage payments on-time, strengthen the safety net for those facing continuing financial hardships, and help homeowners in MHA programs build equity in their homes, an important factor in stabilizing neighborhoods.
""Today's announcement signals our commitment to helping more hardworking families continue the American dream of homeownership,"" said Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julián Castro. ""These enhancements will expand the opportunity for more folks to stay in their home, stabilizing local communities and continuing our nation's positive economic momentum.""
""While the housing sector has strengthened in recent years, there are still many homeowners struggling to make their mortgage payments,"" said Secretary of the Treasury Jacob J. Lew. ""The changes we are announcing today offer meaningful incentives for borrowers to stay current in their modifications, increase their opportunity to build equity in their homes, and provide vital safety nets for those facing greater financial strains.""
Treasury and HUD established HAMP (Home Affordable Modification Program®) in 2009 to provide relief to homeowners facing financial hardship. Through a combination of lowered interest rates and modified loan terms, monthly payments are reduced to affordable levels. In addition, many homeowners who remain current following their modification are eligible to earn up to $5,000 over the first five years of their modification, which is applied in repayment of their outstanding principal balance.
Under the revised guidelines announced today, all homeowners in HAMP will now be eligible to earn $5,000 in the sixth year of their modification, which will reduce their outstanding principal balance by as much as $10,000. Homeowners will also be offered an opportunity to re-amortize the reduced mortgage balance, which will have the effect of lowering their monthly payment. As of today, approximately one million homeowners with HAMP modifications are eligible to earn the increased HAMP incentive.
In addition, in an effort to bolster the safety net for homeowners who face difficulty making their payments in HAMP Tier 1 or similar non-HAMP modifications, Treasury and HUD have introduced enhancements to HAMP Tier 2 and the Home Affordable Foreclosure Alternatives® (HAFA) Program.
HAMP Tier 2 is an alternative modification that provides a low fixed rate for the life of the loan to homeowners who do not qualify for or cannot sustain a HAMP Tier 1 modification. The enhancements announced today include reducing the interest rate for HAMP Tier 2 by 50 basis points, which will enable more homeowners to qualify for a modification, and extending the $5,000 pay-for-performance incentive to HAMP Tier 2 borrowers in good standing at the end of the sixth year of their modification.
HAFA assists homeowners who need to transition to a more affordable living situation through a short sale or deed-in-lieu. Treasury and HUD announced today that they have increased the amount of relocation assistance provided to homeowners to $10,000 to better reflect increased rents and the cost of moving in many parts of the country.

12/05/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-152.cfm,FHA Announces New Loan Limits to Take Effect January 1st,"WASHINGTON - The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) today announced the agency's news schedule of loan limits for 2015. These loan limits are effective for case numbers assigned on or after January 1, 2015, and will remain in effect through the end of the year. Read FHA's mortgagee letter detailing the agency's new loan limits.
FHA's calculation for maximum loan limits in high cost metropolitan areas of the country will remain the same as the 2014 level of $625,500. The current standard loan limit for areas where housing costs are relatively low will also remain unchanged at $271,050.
Each year, FHA recalculates its national loan limit based on a percentage calculation of the national conforming loan limit. Depending on those limits, FHA's minimum national loan limit ""floor"" is at 65 percent of the national conforming loan limit. The floor applies to those areas where 115 percent of the median home price is less than 65 percent of the national conforming loan limit.
Conversely, any area where the loan limit exceeds the ""floor"" is considered a high cost area. The maximum FHA national loan limit ""ceiling"" is at 150 percent of the national conforming limit. In areas where 115 percent of the median home price (of the highest cost county) exceeds 150 percent of the conforming loan limit, the FHA loan limits remain at 150 percent of the conforming loan limit.
Areas are eligible for FHA loan limits above the national standard limit, and up to the national ceiling level, based on median area home prices. Additional information and loan limit adjustments for two-, three-, and four-unit properties, and in Special Exception Areas, are noted in FHA's mortgagee letter. An attachment to the Mortgagee Letter provides information on which counties are eligible for loan limits above the national standard. Borrowers with existing FHA insured mortgages may continue to utilize FHA's Streamline refinance program regardless of their loan balance.
The mortgage loan limits for FHA-insured reverse mortgages will also remain unchanged. The FHA reverse-mortgage product, known as the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM), will continue to have a maximum claim amount of $625,500, with actual loan limits based on property value, borrower age, and current interest rates. Reverse mortgages allow homeowners age 62 and older to age in place by borrowing against the value of their homes without any requirements for monthly payments; no repayment is required as long as a homeowner lives in the home. The reverse mortgage is repaid, with interest, when the homeowner leaves the home.

The rental assistance announced today is provided through the HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) Program which combines rental assistance from HUD with case management and clinical services provided by VA. Last October, the two agencies awarded $62 million in HUD-VASH vouchers to assist more than 9,000 homeless veterans. See the local impact of the housing assistance announced today.
With HUD approaching its 50th anniversary next year, Secretary Julián Castro is focused on advancing policies that create opportunities for all Americans, including the broader Administration goal of ending homelessness among veterans.
""It is unacceptable that after their service and sacrifice, too many of our veterans find themselves living on our streets and in our shelters,"" said Secretary Castro. ""We've made significant progress reducing homelessness among veterans by a third in just four years, and these vouchers will continue to help communities build on these gains, providing targeted assistance to those in need to ensure that every veteran has a home.""
Welcoming the progress made with HUD and local partners under the leadership of President Obama, VA Secretary Robert McDonald added, ""As long as there remains a single veteran living on our streets, there is more work to be done. HUD-VASH vouchers are a vital tool in our efforts to reduce veteran homelessness.""
""Through the HUD-VASH program, communities are making historic progress toward ending homelessness by connecting veterans who have the most intensive service needs to the foundation of a home with supportive services,"" said Laura Green Zeilinger, Executive Director of the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness. ""The grant awards announced today add crucial resources to this effort, helping to deliver on the promise that every veteran who has served America has a home in America.""
HUD-VASH is an important part of the Obama Administration's efforts to provide critical housing and services to veterans experiencing homelessness that also includes HUD's Continuum of Care program as well as VA's Supportive Services for Veteran Families (SSVF).
Since 2008 more than 68,000 vouchers have been awarded and over 80,000 homeless veterans have been served through the HUD-VASH program. Rental assistance and support services provided through HUD-VASH are a critical resource for local communities in ending homelessness among our nation's Veterans.
Additionally, Opening Doors: Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness (http://usich.gov/opening_doors) serves as a roadmap for how the federal government will work with state and local communities to confront the root causes of homelessness, especially among former servicemen and women. As evidence of that commitment, President Obama has asked for an additional $75 million for HUD-VASH vouchers to serve veterans experiencing homelessness in his fiscal year 2015 budget request to Congress.
In the HUD-VASH program, VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) assess veterans experiencing homelessness before referring them to local housing agencies for these vouchers. Decisions are based on a variety of factors, most importantly the duration of homelessness and the need for longer term, more intensive support in obtaining and maintaining permanent housing. The HUD-VASH program includes both the rental assistance the voucher provides and the comprehensive case management that VAMC staff offers.
Veterans participating in the HUD-VASH program rent privately owned housing and generally contribute no more than 30 percent of their income toward rent. VA offers eligible homeless veterans clinical and supportive services through its medical centers across the U.S., Guam and Puerto Rico."

EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take two months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, 4 months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2%) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90-percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised about three percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found on our web site listed above.
* 90% confidence interval includes zero. The Census Bureau does not have sufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero.

12/17/2014:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2014/pr14-153.cfm,Julián Castro Statement on HUD FY2015 Budget,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro today issued the following statement in response to President Obama signing the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015. HUD's $45 billion budget allows the Department to support the individuals and organizations that we currently serve, but also limits HUD's ability to help some new families reach the middle class or pursue their dream of homeownership. As the President has said, the legislation is a compromise and no one got everything they wanted. But, it is a step towards proving that a divided government can work without governing by crisis or threatening an economic recovery that's growing stronger - which the President believes is a hopeful sign for next year.
The Agency will continue to focus on helping to secure quality housing for Americans, ending homelessness, making our communities more resilient from natural disasters, protecting people from housing discrimination and providing and preserving rental housing assistance for millions of extremely poor Americans, among other priorities.
""HUD is the Department of Opportunity. We support millions of Americans with the housing they need to succeed and we invest in making communities economically strong and inclusive. Our mission isn't a Republican or a Democratic issue-it's an American issue,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""As needs for our services have gone up in states, cities and counties across the country, HUD's resources have gone down. As we have time and time again, we'll continue to find creative ways to have the greatest impact with the resources we have available so that we can continue expanding opportunity for all.""
HUD's budget will allow for the continuation of key administration priorities including;
Choice Neighborhoods Initiative - Redevelops severely distressed public and HUD-assisted housing and brings comprehensive neighborhood revitalization to blighted areas. HUD will receive $80 million in FY15 Choice Neighborhoods funds to transform distressed public and assisted housing into sustainable, mixed-income housing with connections to key assets and services supporting positive outcomes for families living in the development and in the surrounding neighborhood. Tribal Lands to Access HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) - For the first time, the successful HUD-VASH program is expanded to include those veterans living in Indian country. This allows HUD to support an additional 10,000 housing vouchers with critical supportive services from VA. HUD-VASH combines housing vouchers with critical supportive services from VA and is a critical component of the Administration's effort to eliminate veteran homelessness by the end of 2015.

""It is unacceptable that after their service and sacrifice, too many of our veterans find themselves living without a roof over their heads,"" said Secretary Castro. ""The expansion of HUD-VASH to include Indian country is a significant step forward in reducing homelessness among veterans. These vouchers will help communities build on the progress of reducing homelessness among veterans by a third in just four years, providing targeted assistance to those in need to ensure that every veteran has a home.""
Two important priority initiatives not included in this year's budget were:
Funding to end chronic homelessness in 2016 - HUD requested a $301 million increase in homeless assistance grants for FY 2015 to develop permanent supportive housing for individuals and families experiencing chronic homelessness. The Department did not receive the full request, directly impacting the thousands of communities across America fighting to end chronic homelessness by the end of 2016. Homeowners Armed with Knowledge (HAWK) - This pilot program for new homebuyers was created in 2014 to further incorporate housing counseling into the home buying process for borrowers using FHA insured financing. The implementation of HAWK is now delayed for at least a year.

The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) provided the following statement on HAWK:
""Over the last few years FHA has proposed a number of steps to better serve borrowers and lenders in an ongoing effort to expand credit access and ultimately continue moving the economy in a positive direction,"" said Biniam Gebre, Acting FHA Commissioner and Assistant Secretary for Housing. ""We are disappointed programs that could have served many families will not be permitted under the bill.""
Under the program, homebuyers who committed to housing counseling would have qualified for tangible savings on their FHA-insured loans. The average buyer would have saved approximately $9,800 over the life of their loan. HUD continues to believe the HAWK program is a strong step toward integrating housing counseling into the home buying process and ensuring broad access to housing counseling services."

The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. Changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show irregular movement. It takes three months to establish a trend for new houses sold.
Preliminary new home sales figures are subject to revision due to the survey methodology and definitions used. The survey is primarily based on a sample of houses selected from building permits. Since a ""sale"" is defined as a deposit taken or sales agreement signed, this can occur prior to a permit being issued. An estimate of these prior sales is included in the sales figure. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimate of total sales is revised about three percent. Changes in sales price data reflect changes in the distribution of houses by region, size, etc., as well as changes in the prices of houses with identical characteristics. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found on our web site listed above.
* 90% confidence interval includes zero. The Census Bureau does not have sufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero.
