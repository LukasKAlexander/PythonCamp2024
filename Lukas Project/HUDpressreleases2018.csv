01/11/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-001.cfm,HUD Awards Record $2 Billion to Thousands of Local Homeless Assistance Programs Across U.S.,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today awarded a record $2 billion to support more than 7,300 local homeless assistance programs across the nation. HUD's Continuum of Care grants provide critically needed support to local programs on the front lines of serving individuals and families experiencing homelessness. View a complete list of all the state and local homeless projects awarded funding on HUD's website.
Due to the last year's devastating hurricanes, HUD extended the application deadline for communities in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands until February 16, 2018.
HUD continues to challenge state and local planning organizations called ""Continuums of Care"" to support their highest performing local programs that have proven most effective in meeting the needs of persons experiencing homelessness in their communities. Many of these state and local planners also embraced HUD's call to shift funds from existing underperforming projects to create new ones that are based on best practices that will further their efforts to prevent and end homelessness.
""HUD stands with our local partners who are working each and every day to house and serve our most vulnerable neighbors,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""We know how to end homelessness and it starts with embracing a housing-first approach that relies upon proven strategies that offer permanent housing solutions to those who may otherwise be living in our shelters and on our streets.""
Matthew Doherty, Executive Director of the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness added, ""Continuums of Care are critical leaders in the work to end homelessness nationwide. When communities marshal these--and other local, state, private, and philanthropic resources--behind the strongest housing-first practices, we see important progress in our collective goal to end homelessness in America.""
HUD Continuum of Care grant funding supports a broad array of interventions designed to assist individuals and families experiencing homelessness, particularly those living in places not meant for habitation, located in sheltering programs, or at imminent risk of becoming homeless. Each year, HUD serves more than a million people through emergency shelter, transitional, and permanent housing programs.
Last month, HUD reported homelessness crept up in the U.S., especially among individuals experiencing long-term chronic homelessness. HUD's 2017 Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress found that 553,742 persons experienced homelessness on a single night in 2017, an increase of .7 percent since last year. Homelessness among families with children declined 5.4 percent nationwide since 2016, local communities report the number of persons experiencing long-term chronic homelessness and Veterans increased. HUD's 2017 homeless estimate points to a significant increase in the number of reported persons experiencing unsheltered homelessness, particularly in California and other high-cost rental markets experiencing a significant shortage of affordable housing."

01/17/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-003.cfm,HUD Offers $25 Million to Clean Up Dangerous Lead in Public Housing,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is offering $25 million in grants to identify and eliminate lead-based paint hazards in public housing. Read HUD's Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) on HUD's website.
These funds are offered through HUD's Public and Indian Housing Lead-Based Paint Capital Fund Program. This funding is needed for housing developments that were tested and abated over twenty years ago and those past control methods may no longer be effective. Additionally, the funding helps meet the backlog of capital needs for public housing. While lead-based paint was banned for residential use in 1978, many older homes, especially un-assisted housing units, may still contain hazards that require proper cleanup.
The funding being offered today directs critical support to public housing agencies to evaluate and clean up lead-based paint hazards in their older housing developments. Agencies will use the funding to perform risk assessments and conduct specialized cleaning to remove or control lead-contaminated dust and soil in and around public housing units.
HUD will award grants to approximately 30 recipients ranging from $25,000 to $1 million. Applications are due March 20, 2018. Visit Grants.gov for more information."

EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take three months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, six months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2 percent) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percentage change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percentage changes are 90 percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percentage changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised 3 percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at the Census Bureau's website (https://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/how_the_data_are_collected/index.html).
* The 90 percent confidence interval includes zero. In such cases, there is insufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero."
01/19/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-006.cfm,"HUD Reaches Fair Housing Agreement with California Housing Authority, Settling Disability Discrimination Complaint","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has reached a conciliation agreement with the Richmond Housing Authority (RHA) in Richmond, California, settling allegations that it discriminated against a resident with disabilities. Read the conciliation agreement.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in the sale or rental of a dwelling because of a disability, including refusing to make reasonable accommodations in policies or practices when a person with a disability requires such an accommodation.
""Reasonable accommodations for persons with disabilities can mean the difference between having a place to call home and being homeless,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will continue working to ensure that no person loses his or her home because of their disability, and that housing providers understand and meet their responsibility to comply with the nation's fair housing laws.""
The agreement is the result of a complaint that was filed by a resident with a disability alleging that the Richmond Housing Authority failed to renew his Housing Choice Voucher before it expired. According to the complaint, the resident submitted a request to have their voucher renewed before it expired, but the housing authority thought that he did not want the voucher renewed. The complaint alleged the Bay Area Legal Aid, a HUD Fair Housing Initiatives Program agency, sent several letters and emails to the housing authority requesting that it reinstate the voucher as a reasonable accommodation, since any miscommunication may have been due to the resident's disability, but the housing authority refused. As a result, the resident was forced to place his belongings in storage and live in homeless shelters and with relatives.
Under the terms of the agreement, the Richmond Housing Authority will pay the resident $5,833 as reimbursement for the storage fees, and provide a new Housing Choice Voucher. The agreement also requires RHA staff to obtain fair housing training.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to www.hud.gov/fairhousing, or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, which can be accessed through Apple and Android devices."

01/25/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-008.cfm,HUD Announces Wholesale Review of Manufactured Housing Rules,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced a top-to-bottom review of its manufactured housing rules as part of a broader effort to identify regulations that may be ineffective, overly burdensome, or excessively costly given the critical need for affordable housing. For the next 30 days, HUD is accepting public comments to identify existing or planned manufactured housing regulatory actions to assess their actual and potential compliance costs and whether those costs are justified against the backdrop of the nation's shortage of affordable housing. Read HUD's notice (https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2018-01276.pdf).
Shortly after taking office, the President issued Executive Order 13771 (""Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs""), directing federal agencies to identify or streamline regulations that are wasteful, inefficient or unnecessary. HUD Secretary Ben Carson quickly followed the President's Executive Order by charging the Department's Regulatory Review Task Force to identify HUD's existing rules that may inhibit job creation or impose costs that exceed the public benefit.
Manufactured housing plays a vital role in meeting the nation's affordable housing needs, providing nearly 10 percent of the total single-family housing stock. It's estimated that more than 22 million American households reside in manufactured housing, particularly in rural areas where this form of housing represents an even greater share of occupied homes. The manufactured housing industry is also an important economic engine, accounting for approximately 35,000 jobs nationwide.
HUD's regulation of manufactured housing fulfills a critical role to ensure a fair and efficient market that supplies affordable housing for households of modest incomes and protecting consumers. HUD may adopt, revise, and interpret its manufactured housing rules based upon the public's comments it receives and the recommendations of the Manufactured Housing Consensus Committee, a statutory federal advisory committee comprised of producers or retailers of manufactured housing as well as consumers, residents and public officials."

HUD's Deputy Secretary Pamela Hughes Patenaude announced the disaster recovery grants with Governor Ricardo Rosselló during her third visit to the island since Hurricanes Irma and Maria.
These recovery funds awarded today are provided through HUD's Community Development Block Grant – Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) Program (https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/cdbg-dr/) and will support long-term recovery of seriously damaged housing and local businesses in Puerto Rico.
""President Trump and the entire HUD family stand with our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico to help them recover from these devastating hurricanes,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""These recovery funds will help repair damaged homes and businesses. As local leaders, along with their citizens, develop their recovery plans, HUD will reduce regulatory barriers and remove any unnecessary roadblocks to speed long-term recovery.""
Governor Rosselló added, ""On behalf of the many thousands of survivors here in Puerto Rico, I want to express our appreciation to the Administration and HUD for recognizing the tremendous needs that remain in so many of our neighborhoods. This grant will make a huge difference in repairing damaged homes and businesses and facilitating the social and economic recovery here in the island.""
Congresswoman Jenniffer González-Colón said, ""The $1.5 billion in CDBG-DR funding that we are announcing originates from the first Continuing Resolution (CR) that we advocated for and approved in Congress last September, out of a total of $7.4 billion that was assigned to HUD to assist in the aftermath of natural disasters. Today's announcement is just another example of our ongoing efforts in Congress to allocate federal funding that helps mitigate the hurricanes' disastrous effects and consequences.""
Background
On September 8, 2017, President Trump signed the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018 and the Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements Act, 2017 (https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/601/text). The Act appropriated $7.4 billion in CDBG-DR funding for major disasters declared in calendar year 2017. To distribute these funds, the Act requires HUD to direct the funds to the areas most impacted by qualifying disasters. HUD will continue to work with Puerto Rico to address its remaining unmet needs.
In making today's allocation to Puerto Rico, HUD relied upon data from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Small Business Administration (SBA) to determine the extent of unmet housing and small business needs in the areas most impacted by the disasters. HUD's analysis found thousands of middle- and lower income homeowners and renters experienced serious damage to their residences and who were not adequately insured (or uninsured) for their losses. Similarly, businesses suffered serious damage that is not adequately covered by insurance or other resources. The grant announced today is designed to help meet needs not being met by private insurance or other sources of federal assistance.
CDBG-DR grants support a variety of disaster recovery activities including housing redevelopment and rebuilding, business assistance, economic revitalization, and infrastructure repair. Grantees are required to spend the majority of these recovery funds in ""most impacted"" areas as identified by HUD. HUD will issue administrative guidelines shortly for use of the funds to address grantees' long-term recovery needs, particularly in the area of housing recovery."

""President Trump and the entire HUD family stand with the people of the Virgin Islands to help them recover from these devastating hurricanes,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""These recovery funds will help with broad based economic recovery including damaged homes. As local leaders, along with their citizens, develop their recovery plans, HUD will reduce regulatory barriers and remove any unnecessary roadblocks to speed long-term recovery.""
""We are immensely grateful that HUD is helping to support the long-term recovery underway in the U.S. Virgin Islands,"" said Governor Mapp. ""We are developing a thoughtful plan to restore our housing stock and support our local business community - together we will rebuild smarter and stronger. I would also like to thank HUD Deputy Secretary Pam Patenaude for her personal visit and sincere interest in the Territory's recovery effort.""
Background
On September 8, 2017, President Trump signed Public Law 115-56 which appropriated $7.4 billion in CDBG-DR funding for major disasters declared in calendar year 2017.

02/12/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-012.cfm,Trump Administration Proposes 2019 HUD Budget,"WASHINGTON - The Trump Administration today announced the proposed Fiscal Year 2019 Budget for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), a $41.24 billion spending plan that continues or expands support for vulnerable populations including those experiencing homelessness, the elderly and persons living with disabilities. The President's 2019 Budget represents a commitment to fiscal restraint, with a modest one percent increase in discretionary funding over last year's request.
While the Budget seeks stable or increased funding for direct rental subsidies to the elderly and disabled, as well as to homeless assistance and lead hazard control, in other less targeted programs, the Administration is committed to the idea that state and local governments are best positioned to address specific needs in their communities. Read HUD's proposed FY 2019 Budget on HUD's website.
""The budget lays out a vision for a government that is efficient, effective, and accountable. It provides for a strong national defense, lays the groundwork for further economic growth and opportunity through reduced regulatory burdens and taxes, and recognizes the importance of aggressively addressing our nation's fiscal challenges,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""I am confident HUD will deliver on its core programs, assist our most vulnerable populations, and make significant enhancements to our programs where needed.""
ENDING HOMELESSNESS
The 2019 Budget continues the Federal goal to prevent and end homelessness by seeking a record $2.4 billion to support thousands of local housing and service programs assisting those living in the nation's sheltering system and on the streets. This represents a $133 million increase over the Administration's 2018 budget request.
ENHANCE RENT ASSISTANCE
The Budget continues support for 4.7 million HUD-assisted households while seeking $601 million for the Housing for the Elderly (Section 202) and $140 million for the Housing for Persons with Disabilities (Section 811) programs. These requested amounts represent an increase of $91 million and $19 million respectively over the President's 2018 budget request.
Over the past year, HUD has examined its main rental assistance programs (Housing Choice Vouchers, Project-Based Rental Assistance, Public Housing, and Housing for the Elderly and Persons with Disabilities) with the goals of simplifying the programs to provide improved resident outcomes, and in turn decreasing the burden to the public by maximizing its investment. These strategic goals are comprised of two initiatives that HUD will pursue through a combination of legislative proposals and administrative actions that will enhance HUD's rental assistance programs and chart a new course for the future of public housing.
Enhance Rental Assistance -The current rental assistance programs structure creates disincentives to employment and stable family formation, imposes large administrative burdens, generates significant costs to the Federal government, and represents a one-size-fits-all approach that does not take into consideration local community needs. The Administration will be sending forward a legislative proposal to Congress that will seek to encourage work and self-sufficiency; simplify program administration; increase local control and choice; and reduce costs to taxpayers. Future of Public Housing - Public Housing has an estimated $26 billion capital needs backlog, and affordable units are lost each year due to severe disrepair. The cumbersome regulatory structure of the Public Housing program limits local Public Housing Agencies' (PHAs) ability to adequately address their significant needs. The budget proposes to merge the Public Housing Capital Fund into the Public Housing Operating Fund with reduced overall funding. This new combined Operating Fund will be given extra flexibilities to pay for capital improvement needs. This better supports local needs by allowing increased flexibility for each PHA to make decisions that best serve their residents. Longer term, HUD will work with local PHAs to shift public housing units to a more sustainable model and to allow State and local governments to take a more active role to support these functions. One of these more sustainable models is HUD Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD). Given the scarcity of federal funds and the substantial capital needs of the nation's aging public housing stock, the Administration proposes removing the statutory limit on the number of public housing units that can participate in RAD. Currently, only 225,000 units of public housing can take advantage of this affordable housing preservation program.
• Enhance Rental Assistance -The current rental assistance programs structure creates disincentives to employment and stable family formation, imposes large administrative burdens, generates significant costs to the Federal government, and represents a one-size-fits-all approach that does not take into consideration local community needs. The Administration will be sending forward a legislative proposal to Congress that will seek to encourage work and self-sufficiency; simplify program administration; increase local control and choice; and reduce costs to taxpayers.
• Future of Public Housing - Public Housing has an estimated $26 billion capital needs backlog, and affordable units are lost each year due to severe disrepair. The cumbersome regulatory structure of the Public Housing program limits local Public Housing Agencies' (PHAs) ability to adequately address their significant needs. The budget proposes to merge the Public Housing Capital Fund into the Public Housing Operating Fund with reduced overall funding. This new combined Operating Fund will be given extra flexibilities to pay for capital improvement needs. This better supports local needs by allowing increased flexibility for each PHA to make decisions that best serve their residents.

Currently, only 225,000 units of public housing can take advantage of this affordable housing preservation program.
SUPPORTING HOMEOWNERSHIP AND FAIR HOUSING
The 2019 Budget continues to support homeownership through the FHA mortgage insurance programs, providing up to $400 billion in new loan guarantee authority that includes critical funding to support targeted improvements to FHA's aging information technology systems, some of which are based upon the outdated COBOL programming language.
In addition, the Budget seeks $550 billion in new guarantee authority for Ginnie Mae, a part of HUD. Ginnie Mae makes affordable housing a reality for millions of low- and moderate-income households across America by channeling global capital into the nation's housing markets. Specifically, Ginnie Mae provides significant liquidity, allowing lenders to obtain a better price for their mortgage loans in the secondary mortgage market. The lenders can then use the proceeds to fund new mortgage loans.
The Administration is also seeking $62 million to support HUD's fair housing mission.
ELIMINATING/REDUCING INEFFECTIVE PROGRAMS
The Administration continues to seek the elimination of the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program, shifting the activities the block grant program supports to the State and local level. Since 1980, and most recently in 2013, HUD studies found that CDBG is not well targeted to the poorest communities and has not demonstrated a measurable impact on communities. Similarly, the Administration proposes through the Budget the elimination of HUD's Choice Neighborhoods Initiative, HOME Investment Partnerships Program, and the Self-Help Homeownership Opportunity Program (SHOP), because State and local governments can better meet their communities' needs.
PROMOTING HEALTHY HOMES
To protect families and their young children from potentially dangerous lead-based paint and other hazards, the Budget requests $145 million to promote healthy and lead-safe housing, $15 million over last year's requested amount.
ENVISION CENTERS
The budget includes $2 million to support HUD's new EnVision Center Demonstration. Located on or near public housing developments, EnVision Centers will be centralized hubs that serve as an incubator to empowering people to graduate from HUD-assisted housing, becoming self-sufficient and responsible homeowners and renters in the private market. By helping move people to self-sufficiency, HUD will be able to help Americans who are underserved."
02/13/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-013.cfm,HUD Announces Agreement with California Housing Authorities Resolving Disability Discrimination Claims,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has reached a Conciliation/Voluntary Compliance Agreement with the Housing Authority of the County of Contra Costa (HACCC) and the Vallejo Housing Authority (VHA), both located in California, resolving allegations that they violated the Fair Housing Act, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Americans with Disabilities Act when they allegedly denied a request by a resident with disabilities to extend her search time to find suitable housing that would accept her Housing Choice Voucher. Read the agreement.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from denying or limiting housing to persons with disabilities, or discriminating in the terms or conditions of housing services, including by refusing to make reasonable accommodations in policies or practices for persons with disabilities. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.
""For residents with disabilities, being allowed a longer period to find housing can be the difference between having a roof over their heads and finding themselves on the street,"" said Anna María Farias, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""This case reminds housing providers of the seriousness of their responsibilities under the Fair Housing Act and Section 504 and demonstrates HUD's commitment to ensuring that housing providers follow through on these responsibilities.""
HUD became involved in the case after a woman filed a complaint alleging that the housing authorities denied her reasonable accommodation request for additional time to find a suitable housing unit where she could use her Housing Choice Voucher, causing her to lose her Voucher.
Under the agreement, HACCC and VHA will pay the woman a total of $10,000. HACCC will also reinstate the woman's Housing Choice Voucher and VHA will port her voucher into its jurisdiction. In addition, the woman will be provided more time to locate and lease housing, and VHA will revise its Extension of Voucher Term policy.
Disability is the most common basis of complaint filed with HUD and its partner agencies. Last year alone, HUD and its state and local partners investigated more than 4,500 disability-related complaints, or nearly 55 percent of all fair housing complaints.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to www.hud.gov/fairhousing, or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, which can be accessed through Apple and Android devices."

EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take three months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, six months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2 percent) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percentage change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percentage changes are 90 percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percentage changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised 3 percent or less.

The funding, provided through HUD's Resident Opportunities and Self Sufficiency - Service Coordinators Program (ROSS-SC) helps grantees hire or retain ""service coordinators"" who work directly with residents to assess their needs and connect them with education, job training and placement programs, and/or computer and financial literacy services available in their community to promote self-sufficiency.
""It's part of our mission to help connect public housing residents to better, higher paying jobs and critical services as a means of helping them move beyond public assistance and toward self-sufficiency,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""This funding gives our local partners resources they can use to help residents become economically independent and achieve the dreams they have for themselves and their children.""
The purpose of HUD's ROSS-SC program is to encourage innovative and locally driven strategies that link public housing assistance with public and private resources to enable HUD-assisted families to increase earned income; reduce or eliminate their need for welfare assistance; and promote economic independence and housing self-sufficiency. These grants provide funding to hire and retain Service Coordinators who will assess the needs of residents of conventional Public Housing or Indian housing and coordinate available resources in the community to meet those needs. In addition, ROSS-SC grants help improve living conditions for seniors, enabling them to age-in-place.

FHA is instructing mortgage servicers to offer additional options to eligible disaster victims in Texas, Louisiana, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, California, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, allowing them to remain in their homes while reducing losses that would otherwise negatively impact FHA's Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund. Read FHA's mortgagee letter.
FHA is introducing a new ""Disaster Standalone Partial Claim"" option to help struggling borrowers to resume their pre-disaster mortgage payments without payment shock. This new option covers up to 12-months of missed mortgage payments via an interest-free second loan on the mortgage, payable only when the borrower sells the home or refinances their mortgage. In addition, this new option requires no trial period or balloon payment and allows borrowers to keep their existing low interest rate and loan term as well as their existing monthly mortgage payment.
The expanded loss mitigation will also streamline income documentation and other requirements to expedite relief to homeowners struggling to pay their mortgage while recovering from last year's disasters.
""It's clear that FHA homeowners in these areas need more help to get back on their feet as they recover from these storms,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""Today, we offer immediate relief to these borrowers which will allow them to resume their mortgage payments without crippling payment shock and fees while protecting our insurance fund in the process.""
FHA's new partial claim option is available to certain borrowers who live and work in Presidentially Declared Major Disaster Areas and who became delinquent on their mortgage payments because of last year's disasters, and whose initial mortgage forbearance periods are ending. Other requirements include:
Borrowers were current on their mortgage payments at the date of the disaster; Borrower's income is equal to or more than their pre-disaster income; and Property is owner-occupied.
• Borrowers were current on their mortgage payments at the date of the disaster;
• Borrower's income is equal to or more than their pre-disaster income; and

Funded through HUD's Choice Neighborhoods Initiative, these grants will help local leaders to craft comprehensive, homegrown plans to revitalize and transform these neighborhoods.
HUD's Choice Neighborhoods Initiative promotes a comprehensive approach to transforming neighborhoods struggling to address the interconnected challenges of distressed housing, inadequate schools, poor health, high crime, and lack of capital. HUD is awarding Choice Neighborhood Planning grants to the following communities:
Read local summaries of the grants announced today.
Choice Neighborhoods is HUD's signature place-based initiative and its vision builds on the work that has been done by the Neighborhood Revitalization Initiative, an interagency partnership between HUD, the Department of Education, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice, and Treasury, since 2009. Choice Neighborhoods is focused on three core goals:
Housing: Replace distressed public and assisted housing with high-quality mixed-income housing that is well-managed and responsive to the needs of the surrounding neighborhood. People: Improve outcomes of households living in the target housing related to employment and income, health, and children's education; and Neighborhood: Create the conditions necessary for public and private reinvestment in distressed neighborhoods to offer the kinds of amenities and assets, including safety, good schools, and commercial activity, that are important to families' choices about their community.

• Neighborhood: Create the conditions necessary for public and private reinvestment in distressed neighborhoods to offer the kinds of amenities and assets, including safety, good schools, and commercial activity, that are important to families' choices about their community.
Through the Choice Neighborhoods planning process local governments, housing authorities, residents, nonprofits, tribal authorities, private developers, school districts, police departments, and other civic organizations create a common vision and develop effective strategies to revitalize their neighborhood. The resulting Transformation Plan lays the foundation for revitalizing the distressed public and/or assisted housing units, transforming the surrounding neighborhood, and promoting opportunities for families. Three of the awardees will receive an additional $950,000 for ""action activities."" The Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles, the City of Lewiston, and the Philadelphia Housing Authority will use these additional funds to build momentum and attract additional investment. Eligible uses of these funds include recycling vacant property into community gardens, pocket parks, or farmers markets; beautification, place-making and community arts projects; homeowner and business façade improvement programs; neighborhood broadband or wi-fi; fresh food initiatives; and gap financing for economic development projects."

The agreement requires the City of Houston to adopt multifamily priorities and a policy for objectively evaluating federally supported affordable housing developments in all areas of Houston; to seek to invest additional funds in homeless assistance programs, and; to encourage more landlord participation in Houston's housing voucher program. Read the Voluntary Compliance Agreement.
""Today, we announce a positive agreement that works to expand housing options for lower income Houston residents, especially in neighborhoods with better performing schools and higher paying jobs,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""We're pleased the City is committed to making sure taxpayer-supported affordable housing development be supported and encouraged in a fair and inclusive manner.""
Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said, ""The City of Houston is pleased with the agreement. We appreciate the commendation HUD provides with it for programs we already have under way and the guidance it offers as we work to build a city of complete communities where all residents can find quality homes in neighborhoods with the economic and educational opportunities necessary for creating success in life.""
Specific provisions of the agreement include:
Broadening Voucher Mobility - HUD and the City of Houston recognize that landlords' reluctance to rent to voucher holders may pose a barrier to mobility in Houston. The City will continue to implement a Voucher Mobility Pilot program to encourage landlords in all areas of the City to rent to qualified families regardless of their source of income. Working with an existing nonprofit organization and local housing authorities, the City will pursue the goal of facilitating mobility of 350 voucher holders in neighborhoods with high-performing schools.
Investing in Homeless Assistance - The Houston Housing Authority (HHA) is a key partner in addressing the City's affordable housing needs. The City has/will invest a combined nearly $3 million from various sources to support individuals and families experiencing homelessness. In addition, the City will work to secure $2 million in disaster assistance to match $2 million in private funding to HHA to help victims of Hurricane Harvey who became homeless.
Developing a Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Site Selection Policy - The City and HUD agree that affordable housing is needed in all areas of Houston, including high opportunity areas like District G. During the two-year term of the agreement, the City will develop and adopt an objective policy for evaluating Resolutions of Support or Resolutions of No Objection for affordable housing applications supported by the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) Program. For example, the City will not permit veto or special points for any individual City Council member in the approval process for LIHTC applications.
Developing an Affordable Housing Strategy - The City will seek comprehensive technical assistance from HUD to meet its obligations under the Fair Housing Act to affirmatively further fair housing. This technical assistance will also help ensure that any current or future disaster recovery funds be fairly applied to help all the citizens of Houston."

Secretary Carson directed HUD's newly appointed Chief Financial Officer, Irving Dennis, to design and implement a transformation plan and lead an internal taskforce to combat waste, fraud and abuse.
In a statement announcing these measures, Secretary Carson said the Department's current financial controls are outdated:
""We simply need to do better. An updated system of internal controls will provide our agency with greater certainty that the dollars we spend are spent in a manner that satisfies all laws and regulations, and most importantly, the American people. We will approach this as any business would by increasing transparency and accountability. In the end, we will also support a culture that respects the fact that HUD funds belong to the public.""
As a former partner at the internationally recognized accounting firm Ernst & Young, Dennis will institute new processes and controls, empower employees, and strengthen compliance and enforcement-related functions at HUD.
""I'm excited to apply a business acumen to a task that is necessary for us as an Agency,"" said Dennis. ""These new internal controls and management practices must be embedded into our organization to help prevent misuse and misappropriation of assets. The goal is to create more robust processes and systems of checks and balances to ensure our expenditures not only meet all of our requirements but pass a common sense 'smell test.'""
HUD's new plan will consist of:
Agency-wide Governance: Implementing an Agency-wide governance structure that allows for more oversight, transparency, monitoring and accountability; Finance Transformation: Developing a plan to restore discipline and accountability in the financial and reporting systems across the Agency. Grant Modernization: Developing a holistic grant modernization plan to improve grant processes and reporting, including improved IT systems; and Process Improvement: Promoting a HUD culture focused on documented and repeatable process with a focus on transparency and cost reasonableness.

03/28/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-023.cfm,Westlawn Gardens Receives National Community Planning Award,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the American Planning Association (APA) today awarded Wisconsin's largest public housing community, Westlawn Gardens, the HUD Secretary's Opportunity & Empowerment Award (https://www.huduser.gov/portal/about/OppEmpowerAward_ 2016_1.html). Read more about Westlawn Gardens (https://www.planning.org/awards/2018/westlawn).
Jointly presented by HUD and APA, the award recognizes a plan, program, or project that improves the quality of life for low- and moderate-income community residents. Emphasis is placed on how creative housing, economic development and private investments have been used in or with a comprehensive community development plan to empower a community.
""Milwaukee's Westlawn Gardens is a great example of what can be achieved through public-private partnerships and an innovative approach to community planning,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""We endeavor to see more public housing communities adopt similar strategies and create a healthy, sustainable living environment for families.""
Through a holistic, community-based design process, Westlawn Gardens is successfully being transformed from an aged and stressed community into a lively, mixed-use, mixed-income neighborhood. The $82 million first phase, funded through the state's largest Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) award created 250 new public housing units and is a mix of townhomes and apartments accommodating the housing needs of many seniors and residents with disabilities.
The first floors of the apartment buildings accommodate neighborhood retail and community services. A renovated elementary school, playground and a beloved community center are in the center of the neighborhood. Opportunities for job growth and economic development are also incorporated in the plan. A partnership with Growing Power created a 30,000 square foot community garden on site to educate and train residents about local food production.
""Westlawn Gardens is inspiration for communities around the country looking to change the conversation and approach to public housing,"" said W. Shedrick Coleman, AIA, chair of the 2018 Awards Jury. ""The hard work and collaboration with residents has generated a strong and vibrant community for years to come.""
Future phases will more than double the available housing and will add market rate ownership and rental housing intermixed with public and affordable housing options to provide a truly mixed-income community. Every new home is designed to LEED standards with durable, weather-resisted materials used to reduce heating and maintenance costs as well as improve indoor and outdoor air quality.
Prior to the new sustainable housing, the original Westlawn neighborhood is well over 50 years old. Over 700 barracks style public housing units on 75 acres inadequately addressed the needs of its 1,771 residents. Superblocks isolated it from its surroundings, physically and socially. Severely undersized housing did not properly serve growing families and individuals. Outdated and underperforming storm water and energy systems also poorly served the residents of the old Westlawn. Through an inclusive and participatory planning process, the team developed long term strategies to transform the neighborhood into a healthy and empowering place to live.
The 2018 APA National Planning Award recipients will be posted on APA's website on March 28, 2018. Additionally, APA's 2018 National Planning Awards luncheon ceremony will take place during the 2018 National Planning Conference in New Orleans, April 21-24, 2018. The award winners will also be featured in the April 2018 issue of Planning magazine.

APA's national awards program, the profession's highest honor, is a proud tradition established more than 50 years ago to recognize outstanding community plans, planning programs and initiatives, public education efforts, and individuals for their leadership on planning issues."
04/02/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-025.cfm,HUD Commemorates Fair Housing Month and 50 Years of the Fair Housing Act,"WASHINGTON - Nearly 50 years ago, President Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1968 and fair housing became law. In signing the landmark measure, President Johnson declared, ""Now, with this bill, the voice of justice speaks again. It proclaims that Fair Housing for all, all human beings who live in this country, is now part of the American way of life.""
April is Fair Housing Month and on April 11, 2018, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) will mark 50th anniversary of the Fair Housing Act in a ceremony in Washington, DC. HUD Secretary Ben Carson said that a half a century later, the Fair Housing Act remains a centerpiece of the work HUD is doing to ensure fair, inclusive housing, free from discrimination for all Americans. Watch Secretary Carson's reflections on the Fair Housing Act (https://youtu.be/sdrjLEv4ajw).
""It was a seminal moment in our country's history when the ideals of equality and fairness were embodied in a law that continues to shape our communities and our neighborhoods 50 years later. But the promises of the Fair Housing Act require our constant vigilance to confront housing discrimination in all its forms and to advance fairness on behalf of those seeking their American dream.""
Co-sponsored by Senators Edward Brooke and Walter Mondale, the Fair Housing Act sought to end residential segregation and ensure all Americans had access to safe and decent housing. The Act originally prohibited discrimination in the sale, rental and financing of housing based on color, race, national origin and religion. Later, the Act was amended to prohibit discrimination based on sex, disability and familial status.
Today, HUD and its state and local partners enforce the Fair Housing Act and support a broad range of education and outreach activities. HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity continues to take action against individuals and housing providers that engage in discrimination. Last year alone, HUD and its partner agencies received more than 8,000 complaints alleging discrimination based on one or more of the Fair Housing Act's seven protected classes.
Every year, HUD, local communities, fair housing advocates, and fair housing organizations across the country enhance the public's awareness of their housing rights, highlight HUD's fair housing enforcement efforts, and emphasize the importance of ending housing discrimination.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to www.hud.gov/fairhousing.

04/05/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-026.cfm,"HUD Charges Owner, Manager of Mississippi Mobile Home Park with Discriminating Against Interracial Family","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has charged Linda and Gene Baker, the owner and manager of a trailer park in Belden, Mississippi, with violating the Fair Housing Act by refusing to rent a lot to an interracial married couple with two children. HUD's Charge of Discrimination alleges that the property manager, upon learning that the husband is African American, told the wife that the family had to move out of the trailer park. Read HUD's Charge.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from refusing to rent because of race or color.
""This month we celebrate the 50th Anniversary of the Fair Housing Act, which prohibits housing discrimination because of race,"" said Anna María Farias, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""This case reminds property owners that they have an obligation to treat all people fairly and demonstrates HUD's continuing commitment to fighting housing discrimination.""
The case began when the African-American man and his Hispanic wife filed a complaint with HUD alleging that the owner and manager of the trailer park refused to rent a lot to them because the husband is African American. According to HUD's Charge, Mr. Baker rented the lot to the wife, believing her to be white. However, the day after the family moved in and Baker learned that her husband is African American, he called her and demanded that the family move out. During the phone call to the woman, Mr. Baker allegedly said, ""White and black shacking"" was problematic for his community, his church and his mother-in-law. The woman asked him to reconsider, but he refused. Instead, he returned the woman's first-month's rent and she and her family moved out of the trailer park.
The charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party elects for the case to be heard in federal court. If the administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages to the complainants for their loss as a result of the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties in order to vindicate the public interest.
April 2018 marks the 50th anniversary of the Fair Housing Act, which prohibits discrimination in housing because of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, disability and familial status. In commemoration, HUD, local communities, housing advocates, and fair housing organizations across the country will conduct a variety of activities to enhance awareness of fair housing rights, highlight HUD's fair housing enforcement efforts, and end housing discrimination in the nation.

04/06/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-027.cfm,"HUD, VA Team Up to Help Homeless Veterans Find Permanent Homes","WASHINGTON - In a continued effort to end veteran homelessness, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) today announced $43 million to 325 local public housing agencies (PHAs) across the country to provide a permanent home to more than 5,200 veterans experiencing homelessness. The supportive housing assistance announced today is provided through the HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) Program, which combines rental assistance from HUD with case management and clinical services provided by VA.
A component of the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program, the HUD-VASH vouchers being awarded today enable homeless veterans to obtain affordable, decent housing in the private market. These vouchers are critical tools in helping communities effectively end homelessness among veterans. See local funding chart below.
""Our nation's veterans deserve more than a life on the streets,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""There is no greater responsibility than to end veteran homeless and to make certain that those who have served our nation have a home they can call their own.""
More than 87,000 vouchers have been awarded and approximately 144,000 homeless veterans have been served through the HUD-VASH program since 2008. More than 500 PHAs administer the HUD-VASH program, and this most recent award includes 102 additional PHAs, increasing HUD-VASH coverage to many communities. Rental assistance and supportive services provided through HUD-VASH are a critical resource for local communities in ending homelessness among our nation's veterans.
In the HUD-VASH program, VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) assess veterans experiencing homelessness before referring them to local housing agencies for these vouchers. Decisions are based on a variety of factors, most importantly the duration of homelessness and the need for longer term, more intensive support in obtaining and maintaining permanent housing. The HUD-VASH program includes both the rental assistance the voucher provides and the comprehensive case management that VAMC staff offers.
Veterans participating in the HUD-VASH program rent privately owned housing and generally contribute no more than 30 percent of their income toward rent. VA offers eligible homeless veterans clinical and supportive services through its medical centers across the U.S., Guam, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands."

These funds are provided through HUD's Community Development Block Grant - Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) Program (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lrmwz8IXXdQ&feature=youtu.be) and will address seriously damaged housing, businesses and infrastructure from major disasters that occurred since 2015.
The grants announced today represent the largest single amount of disaster recovery assistance in HUD's history and include more than $12 billion for major disasters that occurred in 2017 and nearly $16 billion to support 'mitigation' activities in areas that experienced major Presidentially declared disasters since 2015. Mitigation can broadly be described as actions taken to protect communities from the predictable damage from future events.
""It's clear that a number of states and local communities are still struggling to recover from a variety of natural disasters that occurred in the past three years,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""These grants will help rebuild communities impacted by past disasters and will also protect them from major disasters in the future.""
Background
On February 9, 2018, President Trump signed Public Law 115-123, which provides $28 billion in CDBG-DR funding. Congress requires that these funds be used for two purposes:
• Up to $16 billion to address remaining unmet needs from major disasters in 2017, including Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria as well as California wildfires and subsequent mudslides. Congress specified that at least $11 billion of this amount be targeted to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, with $2 billion targeted to repair and upgrade the electrical grid in these jurisdictions.
• At least $12 billion to support mitigation activities among CDBG-DR grantees that experienced presidentially declared disasters from 2015 through 2017. After addressing remaining 2017 unmet needs, the Department is able to make an additional $3.9 billion available for mitigation, bringing amount available for mitigation to nearly $16 billion for recent CDBG-DR grantees.
CDBG-DR grants support a variety of disaster recovery activities including housing redevelopment and rebuilding, business assistance, economic revitalization, and infrastructure repair. Grantees are required to spend the majority of these recovery funds in ""most impacted"" areas as identified by HUD. HUD will issue administrative guidelines shortly for use of the funds to address grantees' long-term recovery needs, particularly in the area of housing recovery."

These funds are provided through HUD's Community Development Block Grant - Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) Program (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lrmwz8IXXdQ&feature=youtu.be) and are intended to rebuild seriously damaged housing, businesses and critical infrastructure.
""It's clear that a number of states and local communities are still struggling to recover from a variety of natural disasters that occurred in the past three years,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""These grants will help rebuild communities impacted by past disasters and will also protect them from major disasters in the future.""
Governor Kenneth Mapp said, ""Just seven months ago we were struck by two Category 5 hurricanes within 12 days of each other causing catastrophic damage throughout our Territory. These storms devastated our entire power grid and severely damaged our hospitals, our schools, our roads as well as thousands of homes and businesses. Yet with the help of FEMA, President Trump, and the efforts of committed Federal partners such as Secretary Carson and Deputy Secretary Patenaude, we have begun our long road to a successful recovery. This additional $1.6 billion CDBG-DR grant that HUD has committed to the US Virgin Islands allows us to continue to rebuild our infrastructure and gives us the flexibility to create a more resilient power distribution system that is less likely to succumb to future storms. On behalf of the people of the US Virgin Islands, I offer my deepest gratitude to the Secretary and Deputy Secretary for their support.""
CDBG-DR grants support a variety of disaster recovery activities including housing redevelopment and rebuilding, business assistance, economic revitalization, and infrastructure repair. Grantees are required to spend the majority of these recovery funds in ""most impacted"" areas as identified by HUD. HUD will issue guidelines shortly and will provide substantial technical support to for use of the funds to address grantees' long-term recovery needs, particularly in the area of housing recovery.
U.S. Virgin Islands planning officials, along with U.S. Virgin Islands citizens, will now develop a disaster recovery plan to identify how these funds will be spent. CDBG-DR funds are designed to meet local needs with critical recovery decisions being made by local citizens."
04/12/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-029.cfm,HUD Joins Justice Department in Nationwide Initiative to Combat Sexual Harassment in Housing,"WASHINGTON - Today, as the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Department of Justice recognizes the 50th Anniversary of the Fair Housing Act, Secretary Carson and Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the nationwide rollout of an initiative aimed at increasing awareness and reporting of sexual harassment in housing. The announcement includes an interagency task force between the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Justice Department to combat sexual harassment in housing, an outreach toolkit, and a public awareness campaign. This three-pronged approach will strengthen the Department's efforts to combat sexual harassment in housing.
""All discrimination stains the very fabric of our nation, but HUD is especially focused on protecting the right of everyone to feel safe and secure in their homes, free from unwanted sexual harassment,"" said Secretary Ben Carson. ""No person should have to tolerate unwanted sexual advances in order to keep a roof over his or her head. Part of our mission at HUD is to provide safe housing and we will remain diligent in this mission to protect those we serve. I look forward to working with Attorney General Sessions and the Department of Justice as part of this task force to bring an end to this type of discrimination.""
""Sexual harassment in housing is illegal, immoral, and unacceptable,"" said Attorney General Sessions. ""It is all too common today, as too many landlords, managers, and their employees attempt to prey on vulnerable women. We will not hesitate to pursue these predators and enforce the law. In October, I ordered a new initiative to bring more of these cases, and we have already won relief for 15 victims. Today we announce three new steps to make the initiative more effective and to win more cases. I want to thank the dedicated and committed professionals in our Civil Rights Division and our partners in the Department of Housing and Urban Development for their hard work in this effort. We will continue to aggressively pursue harassers, because everyone has a right to be safe in their home.""
In October 2017, the Justice Department announced (https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-initiative-combat-sexual-harassment-housing) an initiative to combat sexual harassment (https://www.justice.gov/crt/sexual-harassment-housing-initiative) in housing and launched pilot programs in D.C. and the Western District of Virginia. The initiative sought to increase the Department's efforts to protect women from harassment by landlords, property managers, maintenance workers, security guards, and other employees and representatives of rental property owners. During the pilots, the Department developed and tested ways to better connect both with victims of sexual harassment in housing and with those organizations that victims may turn to first for help - including law enforcement, legal services providers, public housing authorities, sexual assault services providers, and shelters. The Department also tested certain aspects of the initiative in other jurisdictions, including New Jersey, the Central District of California, Massachusetts, Vermont, and Michigan.
The two pilot programs generated an upswing in harassment reporting to the Department from both D.C. and the Western District of Virginia. In D.C., the Department generated six leads since the October 2017 launch. In Virginia, the Department generated three leads. While the Justice Department recognizes that leads and investigations do not always lead to enforcement actions, the pilot program's results-when extrapolated across all the U.S. Attorney's Offices across the country-could lead to hundreds of new reports of sexual harassment in housing across the country.
Because of these promising results, the Department is rolling out three major components to the Initiative.
First, the new HUD-DOJ Task Force to Combat Sexual Harassment in Housing will drive a shared strategy between the Department and HUD for combatting sexual harassment in housing across the country. It will focus on five key areas: continued data sharing and analysis, joint development of training, evaluation of public housing complaint mechanisms, coordination of public outreach and press strategy, and review of federal policies.
Second, the outreach toolkit is designed to leverage the HUD and Justice Department's nationwide network of U.S. Attorney's Offices. The toolkit provides templates, guidance, and checklists based on pilot program feedback. It ultimately will amplify available enforcement resources and help victims of sexual harassment connect with the Department.
Third, the public awareness campaign has three major components: a partnership package with relevant stakeholders, launch of a social media campaign, and Public Service Announcements (PSAs) run by the Executive Office of U.S. Attorneys. The campaign is specifically designed to raise awareness, and make it easier for victims all over the country to find resources and report harassment.
More information about the Civil Rights Division and the civil rights laws it enforces is available at www.usdoj.gov/crt. Individuals who believe that they may have been victims of sexual harassment in housing should call the Department at 1-844-380-6178, send an e-mail to fairhousing@usdoj.gov, or contact HUD at 1-800-669-9777. If you have information or questions about any other housing discrimination, you can contact the Department at (800) 896-7743."

EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take three months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, six months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2 percent) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percentage change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percentage changes are 90 percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percentage changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised 3 percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at the Census Bureau's website (https://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/how_the_data_are_collected/index.html).
* The 90 percent confidence interval includes zero. In such cases, there is insufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero."

A team of graduate students received top honors for their project, Beacon Crossing—a plan for public housing in Dover, N.H., that will provide 150 housing units for seniors and residents with disabilities.
""It is inspiring to see the next generation of young practitioners present new and innovative ideas for improving the quality of housing and addressing our nation's affordability crisis,"" said Dr. Calvin Johnson, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Research, Evaluation and Monitoring in HUD's Office of Policy Development and Research. ""This year's particular focus on providing supportive services for seniors and persons with disabilities responds directly to a key Departmental priority.""
HUD's Innovation in Affordable Housing student competition is intended to encourage research and innovation in affordable housing, to raise practitioner and future practitioner capacity, and to foster cross-cutting team-work within the design and community development process. Multi-disciplinary graduate student teams were asked to create innovative solutions involving design, planning, and finance.
The students presented their final projects to a jury of practitioners and a live audience at HUD's headquarters in Washington, D.C., on April 18. The jurors praised the College Park team members for their proposal's design and financing methods, commended the students for paying close attention to detail, and for articulating a vision to implement innovative technologies without sacrificing affordability. The team also received compliments on their carefully thought out presentation.
The University of Maryland team was awarded $20,000, and the second runner-up, a team from the University of Colorado Denver, received $10,000. Two other finalists from Pratt Institute in New York and the University of Texas at Austin each received an award of $5,000.
By initiating and funding this competition, HUD hopes to inspire and support aspiring members of fields such as architecture, planning, policy, and finance in advancing affordable and sustainable housing for low- and moderate-income Americans."

While America is now experiencing record low unemployment, our country still struggles from nearly record-high welfare enrollment.
Too many Americans remain on the sidelines of our economy. Today, a record 28 million able-bodied adults receive Medicaid, a 400 percent increase since 2000. More than 43 percent of all households receiving federal housing assistance are headed by an able-bodied adult. And in 2016, more than 16 million able-bodied adults received food stamps.
...
Too many of our neighbors are caught in a welfare system that perpetuates a cycle of poverty and breaks the American spirit of work, free enterprise and family. I often wonder what some of my childhood friends could have achieved if our welfare system promoted these fundamental keys to escaping poverty. What new inventions, policy ideas, medical advances, and discoveries never happen because too many languish in poverty?
...
To unlock America's full potential, we need a welfare system of opportunity for the 21st century. The executive order signed by President Trump on Tuesday is a big step in the right direction.
Our welfare system should be a pathway to self-sufficiency by focusing on work and stable families, giving hope to their dreams and a foundation for their success. We need a dynamic and innovative welfare system for today's dynamic economy.
Furthermore, we need a welfare system that is data-driven and measures outcomes, not just participation. If we cannot measure the true impact of our programs on their participants, we will only perpetuate the cycle of poverty.

EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take three months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, six months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2 percent) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percentage change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percentage changes are 90 percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percentage changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised 3 percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at the Census Bureau's website (https://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/how_the_data_are_collected/index.html).
* The 90 percent confidence interval includes zero. In such cases, there is insufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero."
04/25/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-033.cfm,Secretary Carson Proposes Rent Reform,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson today unveiled a package of reforms designed to offer Public Housing Authorities (PHAs), property owners and HUD-assisted families a simpler, less invasive and more transparent set of rent structures, and places HUD's rental assistance programs on a more fiscally sustainable path. Through its Making Affordable Housing Work Act, HUD is seeking to reform decades-old rent policies that are confusing, costly and counterproductive, in that the incentives they create often fail to adequately support individuals and families receiving HUD rental assistance in increasing their earnings.
HUD helps 4.7 million families to access affordable, quality housing and pay their rents, more than half of which are currently headed by senior citizens or persons living with a disability. The rent reforms proposed today will not increase rents paid by qualifying households currently receiving assistance that are comprised of elderly persons or persons with disabilities.
""The system we currently use to calculate a family's rental assistance is broken and holds back the very people we're supposed to be helping,"" said Secretary Carson. ""HUD-assisted households are now required to surrender a long list of personal information, and any new income they earn is 'taxed' every year in the form of a rent increase. Today, we begin a necessary conversation about how we can provide meaningful, dignified assistance to those we serve without hurting them at the same time.""
PHAs and landlords participating in HUD's rental assistance programs must currently navigate a complex set of rules to properly calculate a household's rent contribution. Under these existing rules, tenants are required to surrender vast amounts of personal information each year and are often charged wildly different rents even though they have similar wages. Likewise, owners and PHAs, many with limited staff, must spend many hours calculating the correct payments for their tenants, who may themselves be confused by byzantine rent rules for tenant income calculations. The complex annual income recertification process creates a perverse set of conditions that increase the risk of inaccurate income reporting and discourage family unification and progress toward self-sufficiency.
Currently, Congress requires HUD-assisted households to contribute 30 percent of their adjusted income toward rent while the government pays the difference, up to a maximum amount. This approach, with its complicated set of income certification requirements, imposes substantial administrative burdens on PHAs and owners and may suppress residents' earned income.
HUD is proposing a simplified structure of 'core rents' that offers a more transparent and predictable rent calculation that streamlines program administration for PHAs and owners and is easier for both landlords and tenants to understand. Under this core rent proposal, PHAs and owners would only be required to verify income every three years rather than annually. This would substantially ease the administrative burden on PHAs, owners, and residents and would effectively encourage increased earned income without adversely impacting a household's rent for up to three years. HUD will also create a menu of 'choice rents' that PHAs and owners may implement to promote greater flexibility, local control, and self-sufficiency for non-elderly/non-disabled households."

The Fair Housing Act makes it illegal to discriminate against individuals based on race, color, religion, national origin, sex, familial status, or disability. Sexual harassment is a form of illegal sex discrimination. Earlier this month, HUD and the Department of Justice announced a nationwide rollout of an initiative aimed at increasing awareness and reporting of sexual harassment in housing.
""Landlords are required to comply with the Fair Housing Act, the federal law that has banned housing discrimination for the last 50 years,"" said Anna Maria Farias, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""It's against the law to harass residents of housing because of sex, disability or any another protected characteristic. The settlements we are announcing today reflect HUD's commitment to rooting out sexual harassment and all housing discrimination as we know it.""
Florida
Today, HUD entered into a Voluntary Compliance Agreement/Conciliation Agreement with the Jacksonville, Florida housing authority resolving allegations that a female resident was sexually harassed on multiple occasions by a housing authority employee. The alleged harassment included unwelcome sexual comments, requests for sex or sexual favors, and threats of eviction if the tenant did not submit to such requests. The Housing Authority agreed to pay the resident $75,000, adopt a new sexual harassment policy, and require staff to attend fair housing training. Read the agreement.
Virginia
HUD entered a Conciliation Agreement resolving allegations that an independent living facility failed to take reasonable steps to prevent sexual harassment of a female tenant by another tenant. The female tenant alleged that a male tenant harassed her with unwelcome and unsolicited advances, made suggestive comments, whistled at her, and followed her around the apartment complex. The facility agreed to pay complainants $37,500 and adopt a sexual harassment policy. Read the agreement.
California
Last month, HUD entered a Conciliation Agreement resolving allegations that a California landlord made repeated unwanted sexual advances towards a male tenant with a mental disability and ultimately evicted him for refusing the advances. The landlord agreed to pay the tenant $12,000 and attend fair housing training. Read the agreement.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to www.hud.gov/fairhousing.

Inclusive Communities Project, Inc (https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/13-1371_8m58.pdf).
""HUD remains committed to making sure housing-related policies and practices treat people fairly,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""We will always challenge any practice that discriminates against people the law protects.""
The Department's Disparate Impact Regulation provides a framework for establishing legal liability for facially neutral practices that have discriminatory effects on classes of persons protected under the Fair Housing Act.
The Supreme Court upheld the use of a 'disparate impact' theory to establish liability under the Fair Housing Act in cases where seemingly neutral practices have a discriminatory effect on protected classes of persons. While the Supreme Court referred to HUD's Disparate Impact Regulation in its Inclusive Communities ruling, it did not directly rule upon it.
Shortly, HUD will formally seek the public's comment on whether its Disparate Impact Regulation is consistent with the Supreme Court's Inclusive Communities ruling."

Read the agreement.
The Fair Housing Act makes it illegal to discriminate against individuals based on race, color, religion, national origin, sex, familial status, or disability.
""Denying someone an apartment because of how they look or where they come from not only deprives them of a home, it is against the law,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Today's agreement reaffirms HUD's commitment to ensuring that every person, no matter their race or national origin, has access to the housing of their choice.""
Today's agreement is the result of two complaints the FHCRC filed with HUD after it conducted fair housing tests. The complaints alleged that the owners and managers of Sierra Vista and Grand Oaks Apartments discriminated against applicants because of their race and national origin. According to the complaints, tests conducted by FHCRC allegedly showed that property managers at the two complexes refused to rent, cited different terms and conditions, and misrepresented the availability of units to testers based on their race and national origin.
Under the terms of the agreement, the owners and property managers will pay FHCRC $8,000, require that their employees take fair housing training, amend their rental qualification criteria to remove the requirement that applicants have ""No Criminal or Police Record of Any Kind,"" and develop and implement a nondiscriminatory criminal record policy.
April 2018 marked the 50th anniversary of the Fair Housing Act.

This extended foreclosure moratorium is being provided for an additional 90 days due to continuing needs in these hard-hit territories.
To ensure this moratorium is implemented, HUD is instructing FHA-approved mortgage servicers to suspend all foreclosure actions against eligible FHA borrowers in these Presidentially Declared Major Disaster Areas until August 16, 2018. Read FHA's directive to lenders, servicers and housing counseling agencies. Read FHA's letter to mortgage servicers.
FHA borrowers may qualify for this relief if they meet the following conditions:
They live within the geographic boundaries of a Presidentially declared disaster area impacted by Hurricane Maria; Their ability to make mortgage payments is directly or substantially affected by a disaster; Their mortgage was no more than 60-days past due prior to the date of the Presidentially declared major disaster; and They have not already been approved for a forbearance or other loss mitigation option(s).
• They live within the geographic boundaries of a Presidentially declared disaster area impacted by Hurricane Maria;
• Their ability to make mortgage payments is directly or substantially affected by a disaster;
• Their mortgage was no more than 60-days past due prior to the date of the Presidentially declared major disaster; and
• They have not already been approved for a forbearance or other loss mitigation option(s).
Earlier this year, FHA introduced a new option to help struggling borrowers impacted by Hurricane Maria and other 2017 disasters to resume their pre-disaster mortgage payments without payment shock. FHA's new ""Disaster Standalone Partial Claim"" covers up to 12-months of missed mortgage payments via an interest-free second loan on the mortgage, payable only when the borrower sells the home or refinances their mortgage. In addition, this new option requires no trial period or balloon payment and allows borrowers to keep their existing low-interest rate. FHA's expanded loss mitigation will also streamline income documentation and other requirements to expedite relief to homeowners struggling to pay their mortgage while recovering from last year's disasters.
FHA also has several other options to help disaster victims recover, including:
Forbearance and loan modification options - HUD offers different forbearance and loan modification options for FHA borrowers affected by disasters. Borrowers having trouble making regular payments should contact their loan servicer as soon as possible for more information; FHA-insured Mortgage for Disaster Victims - HUD's Section 203(h) program provides an FHA insured mortgage loan to disaster victims who have lost their homes and are facing the daunting task of rebuilding or buying another home. Borrowers must work with a participating FHA-approved lender in order to be considered for 100 percent financing, including closing costs; and FHA-insured Mortgage for home rehabilitation - HUD's Section 203(k) loan program enables those who have lost their homes to refinance a home or finance the purchase of a home along with its repair costs by using a single mortgage.

Funded through HUD's Self-Help Homeownership Opportunity Program (SHOP), the funding awarded today, along with the labor contributed by the homebuyers and numerous volunteers, will significantly lower the cost of homeownership.
""By rolling up their sleeves and putting in hard work, these grants allow hundreds of working families to become self-sufficient and make owning a home a reality,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""This is private and public partnership at its best and it proves that self-help programs like SHOP work well and support homeownership.""
The following organizations will receive SHOP funds (see individual descriptions below):
The SHOP program provides federal grants on a competitive basis to national and regional non-profit organizations and consortia that have experience in administering self-help homeownership housing programs. The SHOP grants must be used to purchase land and make necessary infrastructure improvements, which together may not exceed an average SHOP investment of $15,000 per dwelling unit. Leveraged funds must be used for the construction or rehabilitation of these homeownership units.
All newly constructed units will receive certification as ENERGY STAR qualified units. All appliances, products or features that are installed or replaced will be ENERGY STAR qualified. Water usage products will bear the WaterSense label. Many units will also have ""Green,"" ""Healthy Homes,"" and ""Universal Design"" features.
Homebuyers will contribute significant sweat equity toward the development of their units and/or the units of other homebuyers participating in the local self-help housing programs. These sweat equity contributions reduce the purchase price of the SHOP units and make these units affordable for low-income homebuyers. A minimum of 100 sweat equity hours is required from a household of two or more persons. A minimum of 50 sweat equity hours is required from a household of one person. Community participation consisting of volunteer labor contributions is also required. Sweat equity and volunteer labor may include, but are not limited to, landscaping, foundation work, painting, carpentry, trim work, drywall, roofing and siding for the housing. Reasonable accommodations must be made for persons with disabilities.
Grantees may carry out activities directly and/or distribute SHOP funds to local non-profit affiliates that will develop the SHOP units, select homebuyers, coordinate the homebuyer sweat equity and volunteer efforts, and assist in the arrangement of interim and permanent financing for the homebuyers. The grantees ensure that the new homebuyers can afford their homes at the time of purchase and for the long term. Many of the SHOP homebuyers are first-time homeowners and come from underserved groups."

05/17/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-042.cfm,HUD Charges Two Ohio Companies with Discriminating Against Residents with Disabilities,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has charged two Ohio corporations, Epcon Communities, Inc., and Epcon Communities Franchising, Inc. (Epcon), with housing discrimination for failing to design and construct thirty-two multifamily housing communities throughout Ohio that meet the accessibility requirements of the Fair Housing Act. Read HUD's charge.
The Fair Housing Act requires that multifamily housing built after March 1991 contain accessible features for people with disabilities. Requirements include accessible common areas, bathrooms and kitchens, as well as wider doors and environmental controls that can be reached by residents who use wheelchairs. The failure to include these features is unlawful and makes the property difficult or impossible to use by people with disabilities.
""It can be very difficult for persons with disabilities to live in housing that does not meet the Fair Housing Act's design and construction requirements,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""If, for example, a unit has stairs at its entry, that unit is effectively unavailable to a person who uses a wheelchair; it's as if the property has a sign saying, 'no wheelchairs allowed.'""
HUD's charge resulted from complaints by the Fair Housing Advocates Association (FHAA), an Ohio-based fair housing organization, and HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. FHAA first filed a complaint with HUD alleging that five Epcon communities in Ohio had numerous inaccessible features in violation of the Fair Housing Act. During its investigation, HUD discovered additional properties, built by Epcon or throughout its franchisees and filed its own complaint alleging that a total of thirty-two Epcon communities were inaccessible.
According to the charge, Epcon allegedly discriminated against persons with disabilities because it lacked unsafe and inaccessible routes that persons with disabilities and others can use to travel between their homes and common areas: mailboxes, the clubhouse and pool.
The charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party elects for the case to be heard in federal court. If the administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages to FHAA for its loss as a result of the discrimination. The judge may also order retrofits at the inaccessible properties, and other injunctive or equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties to vindicate the public interest.
April 2018 marked the 50th anniversary of the passage of the Fair Housing Act and the 30th anniversary of the Act's amendment to prohibit discrimination against persons with disabilities. This year, HUD, local communities, housing advocates, and fair housing organizations across the country are conducting a variety of activities to enhance awareness of fair housing rights, highlight HUD's fair housing enforcement efforts, and end housing discrimination in the nation. For a list of activities, visit www.hud.gov/fairhousingis50.

HUD found that rather than assisting local governments in formulating acceptable Assessments of Fair Housing (AFH), the Local Government Assessment Tool was confusing, difficult to use, and frequently produced unacceptable assessments. As a result, the Department is withdrawing the tool, plans a series of national listening sessions, and will seek public comment on the best framework for local governments to further fair housing choices in their communities (Read HUD's notice (https://www.hudexchange.info/resources/documents/FR-Notice-AFFH-Withdrawal-of-Local-Government-Assessment-Tool.pdf)).
With today's action, HUD is reaffirming its commitment to the Fair Housing Act and the law's requirement that recipients of HUD funding must affirmatively further fair housing (AFFH).
HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity Anna Maria Farías said, ""We believe in furthering fair housing choice in our neighborhoods, but we have to help, not hinder those who have to put our rules into practice. we must make certain that our tools can facilitate the goals we all share-to build inclusive and sustainable communities free from discrimination.""
Background
In July of 2015, HUD published a regulation to equip local governments with data and tools to help them meet their long-standing fair housing obligations to affirmatively further fair housing (AFFH) in their use of HUD funds. However, HUD found convincing evidence that the Assessment of Fair Housing tool for local governments wasn't working well. In fact, more than a third of those early submitters initially failed to produce an acceptable assessment-not for lack of trying but because the assessment tool intended to help them wasn't helpful in promoting fair housing.
Consequently, last January, HUD extended the deadline for local governments to submit an Assessment of Fair Housing (AFH). In today's notice to its stakeholder community, HUD announced it found the tool to be flawed and will now review the assessment tool and its function under the AFFH regulations to make it less burdensome and more helpful in creating impactful fair housing goals.
As a result of today's notice, HUD is also withdrawing its January 5, 2018, notice that extended the deadline for submission of an Assessment of Fair Housing (AFH) by local governments (Read HUD's notice (https://www.hudexchange.info/resources/documents/FR-Notice-AFFH-Withdawal-of-Extension-Notice.pdf)).
In addition, any local government that has not yet submitted an AFH that has been accepted by HUD must conduct a robust Analysis of Impediments (AI) to fair housing choice within its jurisdiction. HUD is reminding these local governments that the legal obligation to affirmatively further fair housing remains in effect, and their AIs serve as effective fair housing planning tools. (Read HUD's notice (https://www.hudexchange.info/resources/documents/FR-Notice-AFFH-AI-Notice.pdf)).
Meanwhile, HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity is offering an unprecedented level of technical assistance to local jurisdictions in the preparation of their fair housing analyses. Read more (https://www.hudexchange.info/program-support/technical-assistance/)."
05/22/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-045.cfm,"HUD Awards $2.6 Billion to Improve, Preserve Nation's Public Housing","WASHINGTON - To help public housing authorities make needed capital improvements to their properties, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today allocated more $2.6 billion in annual funding to housing authorities in all 50 states, as well as the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. See all the local grants announced today.
The grants announced today are provided through HUD's Capital Fund Program, which offers annual funding to approximately 3,100 public housing authorities to build, repair, renovate and/or modernize the public housing in their communities. These housing authorities use the funding to complete large-scale improvements such as replacing roofs or making energy-efficient upgrades to replace old plumbing and electrical systems.
To help provide residents with decent, safe and sanitary housing and respond to the growing demand for affordable rental housing, HUD uses the Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD), a comprehensive strategy that complements the Capital Fund Program. RAD offers a long-term solution to preserve and enhance the country's affordable housing stock, including leveraging public and private funding to make critically needed improvements.
For more than 75 years, the federal government has been investing billions of dollars in developing and maintaining public housing, including providing critical support through the Capital Fund grants announced today. Nonetheless, there has been a net loss of over 135,000 public housing units since fiscal year 2000, representing an average loss of approximately 9,000 units annually.
In 2011, HUD released Capital Needs in the Public Housing Program, a third-party independent study that estimated the capital needs in the public housing stock in the U.S. The study found the nation's 1.1 million public housing units are facing an estimated $25.6 billion in large-scale repairs. Unlike routine maintenance, capital needs are extensive improvements required to make the housing decent and economically sustainable, such as replacing roofs or updating plumbing and electrical systems to increase energy efficiency.
Since Congress authorized the RAD demonstration in November of 2011, early results show it is generating significant additional capital for distressed public housing. As a result, more than 88,000 public housing units are converting to a more sustainable Section 8 financing platform, all without any additional costs to taxpayers. Public Housing Authorities and their partners have generated over $5 billion to preserve or replace distressed units and support local jobs in their communities - all without additional federal resources."

EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take three months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, six months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2 percent) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percentage change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percentage changes are 90 percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percentage changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised 3 percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at the Census Bureau's website (https://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/how_the_data_are_collected/index.html).
* The 90 percent confidence interval includes zero. In such cases, there is insufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero."
05/23/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-047.cfm,Senate Confirms Brian Montgomery to Lead Federal Housing Administration,"WASHINGTON - By a vote of 74-23, the U.S. Senate today confirmed President Donald J. Trump's nomination of Brian D. Montgomery to serve as Assistant Secretary of Housing at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and Commissioner of the Federal Housing Administration (FHA).
Montgomery's confirmation marks his second term as Assistant Secretary for Housing and FHA Commissioner at HUD. He previously held the job under President George W. Bush, staying on for six months after President Barack Obama's inauguration.
""Brian brings a wealth of housing knowledge and experience to HUD having held this position in two previous administrations, and we are excited to welcome him back to the Agency,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""FHA's work is critical to HUD's mission of advancing sustainable homeownership opportunities and quality affordable housing for all Americans. Brian understands this better than anyone and will be ready on day one to address the challenges of today's housing market.""
""I'm honored to have the opportunity to serve with Secretary Carson and the team at HUD to further equal access to affordable rental housing and homeownership opportunities and seek solutions to restore vitality to the housing market,"" Montgomery said.
In addition to previously serving in the position, Montgomery has also held several other top positions throughout the government and housing industry, including Co-founder and Partner at the Collingwood Group, Deputy Assistant to the President from 2001 to 2003 including service as Secretary to the Cabinet from 2003 to 2005, and Board Member on the Federal Housing Finance Board, the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 Oversight Board, and NeighborWorks America Board.
Montgomery was nominated by President Trump on September 12, 2017.

05/24/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-048.cfm,HUD Charges New York Property Owners and Agents with Discriminating Against Resident with Disabilities,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced it is charging Syracuse, New York, property owners Nolo Contendere, LLC and Nolo Contendere LLC Trust, and their agents with housing discrimination for allegedly refusing to allow a woman with mental disabilities to keep an assistance animal. Read HUD's charge.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from denying or limiting housing to persons with disabilities or from refusing to make reasonable accommodations in policies or practices. This includes denying a request for an assistance animal.
""Persons who require assistance animals in order to maintain their independence shouldn't have their requests for such accommodations unlawfully denied,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Today's action reaffirms HUD's commitment to ensuring that housing providers meet their obligation to comply with the Fair Housing Act.""
The case came to HUD's attention when a woman with mental disabilities filed a complaint alleging that Nolo Contendere, LLC, which owns the apartment building she lives in, refused to allow her to keep an emotional support dog. HUD's charge of discrimination alleges that the woman requires the use of an assistance animal to help with her disability. After bringing the animal home, however, an agent for Nolo Contendere confronted her and allegedly gave her a choice of either getting rid of the animal or being evicted, even though she provided a letter from her primary care physician attesting to her need for the animal.
According to the charge, the woman contacted Central New York Fair Housing (CNYFH), a HUD Fair Housing Initiatives Program agency, for assistance. CNYFH contacted the agents and explained their obligations under the Fair Housing Act, but they refused to make an exception to their ""no-pets"" policy. One of the agents stated that the policy would also apply to seeing-eye dogs for blind tenants, and allegedly told the woman, ""I know you're trying to play the disability game. We're not playing it.""
""This Charge represents HUD's commitment to ensuring that housing providers offer equal opportunities to persons with disabilities looking to rent a home,"" said J. Paul Compton Jr., HUD's General Counsel.
The charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party elects for the case to be heard in federal court. If the administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages to the complainant for her loss as a result of the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties in order to vindicate the public interest.
April 2018 marked the 50th anniversary of the passage of the Fair Housing Act. This year, HUD, local communities, housing advocates, and fair housing organizations across the country are conducting a variety of activities to enhance awareness of fair housing rights, highlight HUD's fair housing enforcement efforts, and end housing discrimination in the nation. For a list of activities, visit www.hud.gov/fairhousingis50.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in housing because of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, disability and familial status. People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY).

05/28/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-049.cfm,HUD Approves Agreement Between Nevada Real Estate Companies and Applicant Resolving Claims of Disability Discrimination,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has approved a Conciliation Agreement between Delta House Investments, LLC in Reno, Nevada, and Premier Realty, Inc., of Carson City, Nevada, and a prospective tenant resolving allegations that they denied the applicant's request to have an assistance animal. Read the agreement.
The Fair Housing Act requires housing providers to make reasonable accommodations in policies or practices when a person with a disability requires such accommodations, including granting waivers to ""no-pet"" policies for persons who require assistance animals. Additionally, the law makes it unlawful to make housing unavailable to any person because of a disability.
""Forcing persons with disabilities to live without the assistance animals they depend on denies them the opportunity to fully enjoy their home,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""This case was resolved quickly and represents our continued commitment to protecting the rights of persons who require such accommodations and ensuring that housing providers meet their obligation to comply with the nation's fair housing laws.""
The agreement is the result of a complaint a woman filed with HUD alleging that Delta House Investments and Premier Realty denied her request to keep an assistance animal in the apartment she was attempting to rent, even though she provided documentation from her doctor attesting to her need for the animal due to her disability. According to the woman's complaint, the leasing agent told her that the owner did not allow pets because the floors had been recently upgraded to hardwood. After that interaction, the woman did not pursue the rental.
Under the terms of the agreement, respondents will pay the woman $6,000; obtain fair housing training; and adopt reasonable accommodation policies that assess requests on a timely basis and maintain records related to such requests.
April 2018 marked the 50th anniversary of the Fair Housing Act.

05/31/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-050.cfm,HUD Kicks Off National Homeownership Month 2018,"WASHINGTON - June begins National Homeownership Month, a time of year when the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and others mark the importance of owning a home and the impact it has on the lives of American families, local neighborhoods and to the nation's economic health. This year's theme is National Homeownership Month 2018: Find Your Place.
President Donald J. Trump today proclaimed June 2018 National Homeownership Month (https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/president-donald-j-trump-proclaims-june-2018-national-homeownership-month/): ""This month, we celebrate those Americans whose success and determination have helped make them homeowners. Their dedication to their families and communities, and to achieving a brighter and more secure future, is an inspiration to each person who is pursuing their own American Dream.""
""Homeownership serves as an enduring symbol of security and prosperity, and it provides many Americans with a legacy they can pass down to their children and grandchildren,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""During National Homeownership Month, we recognize the abiding value of owning a home, and we rededicate ourselves toward helping hard-working families to find their place in the American dream.""

For generations of families, the goal of owning one's home has been essential to achieving the American dream. HUD recognizes the value of owning a home in building household wealth and is working to ensure that credit qualified borrowers can access and sustain their homes.
Since 1934, more than 47 million households purchased a home with mortgage loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). During the housing crisis of a decade ago, FHA played a critical role in keeping affordable mortgage financing available for millions of qualified borrowers. Today, home sales are at pre-crisis levels and home prices on the rise in most parts of the country as millennials make up the largest segment of first-time homebuyers. Through FHA, and a national network of HUD-approved counseling agencies, HUD is working to make responsible homeownership a reality for millions of Americans.
Homeownership Facts:
HUD's Office of Housing Counseling (OHC) supports a nationwide network of more than 1,800 housing counseling agencies. Their mission is to provide individuals and families with the knowledge they need to obtain, sustain, and improve their housing. Read more about the benefits of housing counseling on HUD's website. To help with responsible homeownership, housing counselors provide homeowner education, pre-purchase and foreclosure prevention counseling, assistance with creating a budget and setting financial goals, fair housing information, and a host of other services. Struggling homeowners at risk of default who work with a housing counselor are more likely to get a loan modification, and are 30% less likely to face foreclosure, compared to similar owners who did not get counseled. The median wealth or net worth of a homeowner is nearly $200,000 or 36 times greater that of the median renter who had just over $5,000. Homeowners move far less frequently than renters, making it easier to build community networks and support systems. Children of families who own their homes are more likely to graduate high school and earn more income later in life. Last year alone, more than 1.2 million people turned to FHA to help them buy a home or to refinance into a lower cost mortgage. Today, an estimated 40 percent of all borrowers turn to FHA to purchase their first home. 44 percent of home purchases by African American families and 43 percent of home purchases by Hispanic families are assisted by FHA.

06/01/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-051.cfm,Secretary Carson Kicks-Off National Healthy Homes Month - Announces Protect Our Kids! Campaign to Enforce Lead Safety Rules,"WASHINGTON - June is National Healthy Homes Month. This year, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is focused on protecting current and future generations of children from exposure to lead-based paint hazards in older homes.
HUD Secretary Ben Carson kicked off the month at a housing and health symposium at the University of North Carolina-Greensboro where he announced Protect our Kids! - a Department-wide enforcement campaign to get landlords and sellers of older homes to fulfill their responsibilities to disclose lead-based paint hazards in their properties. The campaign will also work on ensuring that all federally assisted homes are lead-safe.
""While lead poisoning is entirely preventable, we continue to see far too many children being exposed to lead hazards in their own homes,"" said Secretary Carson. ""All of us have a responsibility to protect kids, and that includes those who rent or sell older homes that may contain potentially harmful lead.""
HUD's Protect our Kids! lead safety rules enforcement campaign is a combined effort by multiple enforcement and program offices at the Department, including HUD's Office of General Counsel (OGC); Departmental Enforcement Center (DEC); Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes (Healthy Homes); Office of the Inspector General (OIG); Office of Public and Indian Housing; Real Estate Assessment Center; and the Office of Multifamily Housing Programs. The objective of the campaign is to review and ensure compliance with regulations that are intended to reduce the potential of lead poisoning in children, in both privately owned homes and those receiving federal assistance.
Under HUD and EPA's Lead Disclosure Rule, most landlords and sellers of homes built before 1978 are required to inform tenants and purchasers of any known lead-based paint or lead-based paint hazards in the home. HUD's Lead-Safe Housing Rule requires providers of most pre-1978 housing that is federally owned or receiving Federal assistance to make certain their units are lead safe.
• Under HUD and EPA's Lead Disclosure Rule, most landlords and sellers of homes built before 1978 are required to inform tenants and purchasers of any known lead-based paint or lead-based paint hazards in the home.
• HUD's Lead-Safe Housing Rule requires providers of most pre-1978 housing that is federally owned or receiving Federal assistance to make certain their units are lead safe.
As part of the Protect our Kids! campaign, HUD is taking several actions to ensure compliance with these rules:
Alexander County (IL) Housing Authority (ACHA) - HUD brought actions against two former Executive Directors of ACHA in Cairo, Illinois for failure to comply with obligations under the Lead Safe Housing Rule. During their respective tenures as Executive Director, ACHA failed to undertake the necessary steps to monitor known lead-based paint hazards in its developments and falsely certified to HUD that they had done so. HUD is seeking to exclude through debarment the former Executive Directors from future participation with the Federal government and to impose civil penalties. First King Properties, LLC (Newark, New Jersey) - HUD issued a Pre-penalty notice to the owners and managers of Garden Spires Apartments, a 350-unit HUD-assisted housing complex in Newark, New Jersey, informing them that they could be liable for millions of dollars in penalties for failing to comply with HUD's Lead Safe Housing Rule and Lead Disclosure Rule. HUD alleges that, even though they knew their property contained lead-based paint, they failed to disclose its presence to tenants. HUD also alleges that hazardous physical conditions identified by HUD inspectors were not corrected by the owners or managers. In addition, HUD alleges the owners and managers failed to conduct the necessary risk assessment reevaluations of lead-based paint hazards that should have been conducted at least as far back as 2011, until October 2017. Towns of Westville and Chateaugay, New York - Following investigations into the violations of the Lead Safe Housing Rule, HUD reached a $25,000 settlement with the Town of Westville and a $40,000 settlement with the Town of Chateaugay. The towns used Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds to rehabilitate the homes of 39 low- and moderate-income households. The Lead Safe Housing Rule requires that a certified lead-based paint professional determine if lead-based paint will be disturbed in any pre-1978 property rehabilitated with CDBG funds and for the rehabilitation work to include controlling any lead-based paint hazards. However, neither town used a certified lead-based paint inspector or risk assessor during these rehabilitations, and both failed to ensure that the individual compensated with CDBG funds performed any lead inspection or controlled any lead-based paint hazards. Bergman Rentals (Durham, North Carolina) - Bergman Rentals manages about 245 properties in North Carolina, approximately half of which are owned by Lee Ray Bergman LLC and half by Southern Repair Services. About 20 of these properties are assisted through HUD's Housing Choice Voucher Program. Based on its examination of lease agreements, HUD determined that many leases had missing or incomplete lead disclosure forms, or the disclosure forms were dated well after execution of the lease. HUD issued a Pre-penalty notice to the owners notifying them of monetary penalties unless they reach an acceptable settlement to resolve these complaints. Bissette Realty (Wilson, North Carolina) - Bissette Realty manages more than 87 housing units in North Carolina. After learning about the presence of lead-based paint hazards in multiple properties, HUD reviewed the leases and found they were missing required lead disclosure forms, contained incomplete forms that did not disclose the presence of hazards to the tenants, or forms were dated well after execution of the lease. HUD sent a Pre-Penalty notice to the owner of Bissette, indicating the potential for monetary penalties unless they reach an acceptable settlement to resolve these complaints. Andrew and Cynthia Dunham (Cedar Rapids, Iowa) - The Dunhams own and manage about 23 single family properties in Cedar Rapids, Iowa that were built prior to 1978. HUD discovered that despite their knowing that lead-based paint hazards were present at one of their properties, the Dunhams did not provide the tenants in any of their pre-1978 properties with the required lead disclosure forms until after HUD's initial contact.

Lead is a highly toxic metal that may cause a range of health problems, especially in young children. When lead is absorbed into the body, it can cause damage to the brain and other vital organs, like the kidneys, nerves and blood. Lead may also cause behavioral problems, learning disabilities, seizures and in extreme cases, death. Some symptoms of lead poisoning may include headaches, stomachaches, nausea, fatigue and irritability. Children who are lead poisoned may show no symptoms.
HUD estimates that nearly 30 million homes in the Unites States have indoor environmental hazards such as lead-based paint, mold, pests, water leaks, and many others. The Department's Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes promotes local efforts to eliminate dangerous lead paint and other housing-related health hazards from lower- and moderate-income homes; stimulates private sector investment in lead hazard control; supports cutting-edge research on methods for assessing and controlling housing-related health and safety hazards; and educates the public about the dangers of hazards in the home.

To support these local efforts, and to expand the public's awareness about the dangers of lead, HUD developed a toolkit that underscores the importance of lead testing and provides tips on how to prevent lead poisoning.

06/04/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-052.cfm,HUD Awards Nearly $20 Million to Support Homeless Programs in Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today awarded nearly $20 million to support to dozens of local homeless housing and service programs in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The Continuum of Care grants announced today provide critically needed housing and support services to individuals and families experiencing homelessness across the territories, including those impacted by Hurricanes Maria and Irma (see attached list of local projects receiving funding).
HUD Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development Neal Rackleff announced the homeless assistance funding during a visit to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands to meet with local leaders on the region's ongoing disaster recovery efforts. In addition to the homeless assistance announced today, HUD earlier awarded Puerto Rico nearly $20 billion to support long-term disaster recovery following last year's hurricanes.
""As we work to support long-term disaster recovery in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, we will not forget those individuals and families experiencing homelessness,"" said HUD Assistant Secretary Rackleff. ""Secretary Carson and this Administration stand shoulder-to-shoulder with our partners to support real housing solutions for those who may otherwise be living in our shelters or on our streets.""
Due to last year's devastating hurricanes, HUD extended the application deadline for communities in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands to apply for Continuum of Care funding. HUD is continuing to work with state and local partners to support higher performing local programs that have proven most effective in meeting their local challenges, often shifting funds from existing projects to create new ones that will have a more substantial and lasting impact on reducing homelessness.
Homelessness declined approximately 20 percent in Puerto Rico since 2016. According to data reported to HUD from local communities in Puerto Rico, an estimated 3,525 persons, primarily individuals, experienced homelessness on a single night in January of 2017. Homelessness among families with children declined 62 percent in Puerto between 2016 and 2017, though these estimates occurred prior to Hurricanes Irma and Maria.
Across the nation, local homelessness planning agencies called 'Continuums of Care' organize volunteers to help count the number of persons located in emergency shelters, transitional housing programs and living unsheltered on the streets. These Continuums of Care will report these one-night 'point-in-time counts' later in the year which will form the basis of HUD's 2018 national homeless estimate."
06/04/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-053.cfm,June is National Healthy Homes Month,"WASHINGTON - Homes and health are inextricably linked together, reflect two of the most basic needs of a society, and serve as an indicator of the strength of the nation. In an effort to help families create healthier living conditions for themselves and their kids, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is kicking off the third annual National Healthy Homes Month (NHHM).
This year's theme, Unlocking the Potential of America's Children: Check Your Home-Protect Your Family, focuses on the opportunity to protect current and future generations of children from the exposures to lead from contaminated paint, dust, and soil.
Last week, Secretary Ben Carson kicked off National Healthy Homes Month at a housing and health symposium at the University of North Carolina-Greensboro where he announced Protect our Kids! - a Department-wide enforcement campaign to get landlords and sellers of older homes to fulfill their responsibilities to disclose lead-based paint hazards in their properties. The month will conclude with the National Healthy Homes Conference, held in conjunction with the National Environmental Health Association's Annual Educational Conference (https://www.neha.org/news-events/aec-annual-educational-conference-0), June 25-28, in Anaheim, California.
Throughout the month, HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes and its partners seek to increase awareness about health and safety hazards in the home, and to examine new methods to protect families.
""Making homes safe and healthy involves collaborations among federal and local agencies, residents and community organizations,"" says Matt Ammon, Director of HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes. ""During Healthy Homes Month, we're mobilizing the collective efforts of Federal, State and local health and housing professionals to protect families where they spend most of their time-in their home, because it's hard to be healthy when your home is making you sick.""
Since 1993, HUD's lead hazard control grant programs created more than 200,000 lead-safe homes for lower income families in 45 states. In addition, HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes offers a wide range of educational tools, products, and resources for having and maintaining a healthy home. A specially designed toolkit has been developed for professional audiences, so that they can reach out to the residents and other stakeholders they serve. The toll-free National Lead Information Center (1-800-424-LEAD) can also provide additional information.

One of Secretary Carson's signature initiatives, EnVision Centers will offer HUD-assisted families access to support services that can help them achieve self-sufficiency, thereby making scarce federal resources more readily available to a greater number of households currently waiting to receive HUD assistance. Read more about HUD's EnVision Center Demonstration.
Secretary Carson and Detroit Mayor Michael Duggan met with public housing residents, community leaders and other stakeholders at Life Remodeled's (http://liferemodeled.com/) Durfee Innovation Society, among the first group of demonstration communities named today.
""Housing assistance should be more than just putting a roof over someone's head,"" said Secretary Carson. ""These EnVision Centers offer a more holistic housing approach by connecting HUD-assisted families with the tools they need to become self-sufficient and to flourish.""
Mayor Duggan added, ""EnVision Centers are about bringing services to people in neighborhoods and I am thankful that our partners at HUD chose Detroit to open the first one in the country. This new center will help make the most of these services and facilities that serve the community.""
Located on or near public housing developments, EnVision Centers will be centralized hubs that serve as an incubator to support four key pillars of self-sufficiency - (1) Economic Empowerment, (2) Educational Advancement, (3) Health and Wellness, and (4) Character and Leadership.
Through results-driven partnerships with organizations such as: federal agencies, state and local governments, non-profits, faith-based organizations, corporations, public housing authorities, and housing finance agencies, EnVision Centers will leverage public-private partnerships to connect HUD-assisted households with services that offer pathways to self-sufficiency.
After the groundbreaking each demonstration community receiving the EnVision Center designation will convene with their local stakeholders and resident councils to assist in the selection of services to be offered at the Center, as a means of ensuring that many voices are heard and the needs identified are addressed. HUD will develop tools to track and measure resident outcomes of EnVision Center participants and services - the goal of which is to ensure the EnVision Centers are able to achieve and monitor progress against the goals of the program.
The EnVision Center demonstration communities announced today include:

06/11/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-055.cfm,Federal Government Reaches Historic Agreement with New York City Housing Authority to Improve Health and Living Conditions,"NEW YORK - U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson today announced a historic agreement with the nation's largest public housing authority to correct dangerous lead-based paint and other health and safety hazards. HUD, the Justice Department, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reached a Consent Decree with New York City and the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) to resolve widespread issues of lead, mold, pest infestations and other inadequate housing conditions. Read the Federal Complaint and the Consent Decree filed today in federal District Court for the Southern District of New York.
Under the terms of the agreement, New York City will invest at least $1.2 billion to abate lead-based paint hazards in tens of thousands of public housing units and will correct a number of longstanding housing deficiencies including inadequate heating, failing elevators and a significant backlog of work orders. In addition, a court-appointed Monitor will oversee the City's corrective action plan and will ensure compliance with the Consent Decree.
More than 400,000 residents live in NYCHA properties, exceeding the number of residents living in the next ten largest public housing authorities combined. In addition to the agreement announced today, New York State placed NYCHA under a state of emergency order in April and is committing up to $550 million to assist the public housing authority in resolving health and safety issues.
""This historic agreement marks a new era for New York City's public housing, one that puts families and their children first,"" said HUD Secretary Carson. ""New York City and New York State are making an unprecedented commitment to put NYCHA on a new path. The cooperation of Federal, State and city officials will vastly improve the living conditions for hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers who call NYCHA home.""
U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman stated: ""NYCHA's failure to provide decent, safe, and sanitary housing is simply unacceptable, and illegal. Children must be protected from toxic lead paint, apartments must be free of mold and pest infestations, and developments must provide adequate heat in winter and elevator service. NYCHA has put its residents at risk. Today's unprecedented settlement will improve life for the 400,000 residents who call NYCHA home, while ensuring accountability, reform, and oversight at this troubled institution.""
HUD's Principal Deputy Inspector General Helen M. Albert said: ""We are proud of the integral work that the OIG staff performed which led to today's settlement. This represents a consequential partnership with the U.S. Attorney and others to ensure that those who reside in NYCHA housing will do so in safe and sanitary conditions.""
EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt said: ""Instead of protecting children from lead poisoning, NYCHA systematically violated EPA and HUD lead paint safety regulations and covered up its noncompliance. Today's landmark settlement puts a stop to that. It is not only a great example of what EPA and HUD can achieve by working together, but it also sends a strong message to housing authorities, landlords, and renovators - violating the law and endangering public health will not be tolerated. This agreement will dramatically improve the living conditions of New York City's most vulnerable residents.""
In addition to annual public housing capital funding from HUD, New York City will provide the following financial investment to support NYCHA under this agreement:
$1 billion in capital funding over the first four years of the agreement; $200 million in capital funding each year after the initial four-year period; Additional operating and capital funds through 2027; and The City will continue its current practice of not seeking payments from NYCHA for 'payments in lieu of taxes' and police services.
• $1 billion in capital funding over the first four years of the agreement;
• $200 million in capital funding each year after the initial four-year period;
• Additional operating and capital funds through 2027; and
• The City will continue its current practice of not seeking payments from NYCHA for 'payments in lieu of taxes' and police services.
Working with the court-appointed Monitor, NYCHA will also institute a number of institutional changes at the agency. These changes include the creation of a new Compliance Department to ensure NYCHA meets all federal, state and local regulatory requirements and ensures the integrity of physical inspections. NYCHA will also create a new Environmental Health and Safety Department to address lead-based paint hazards, mold, heating, pests, elevators, air quality and other physical conditions that affect residents' health or safety. In addition, NYCHA will create a Quality Assurance Unit to verify the completion and quality of maintenance work.
The Consent Decree resolves the Federal government's civil complaint against NYCHA. As a result of the agreement, HUD will lift it's 'zero threshold' for NYCHA and allow the agency to resume spending its existing public housing capital funding without seeking prior HUD approval. This year alone, HUD is providing NYCHA nearly $1.5 billion to further assist the agency to meet its capital needs and to operate its programs."
06/15/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-056.cfm,HUD Approves Agreement Settling Housing Discrimination Complaint Against Two San Francisco Real Estate Companies,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has approved a Voluntary Compliance/Conciliation Agreement settling a complaint filed by a family whose infant has a disability against San Francisco, California-based John Stewart Company and Hunters Point East West, LP. The complaint alleged that the companies denied the family's request to move to a non-smoking unit. Read the Agreement.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from denying or limiting housing to persons with disabilities, or from refusing to make reasonable accommodations in policies or practices for persons with disabilities.
""A smoke-free environment can make a world of difference to a family whose child has a disability that limits their breathing,"" said HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity Anna María Farías. ""Reaching a mutually agreeable settlement of the case is a 'win-win' for everyone involved.""
The case came to HUD's attention when the family filed a complaint alleging that the John Stewart Company, which manages their building through HUD's Rental Assistance Demonstration Program, and Hunters Point East West denied their request to move to a unit in a non-smoking building as a reasonable accommodation. The family's infant has a disability that impacts his breathing. The family claimed that instead of transferring them to a smoke-free building, representatives of the John Stewart Company provided them with an air purifier.
Under the Voluntary Compliance/Conciliation Agreement, the John Stewart Company will, among other things, pay the woman and her adult daughter $12,000 and develop a grievance procedure that complies with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.
Disability is the most common basis of complaint filed with HUD and its partner agencies. Last year alone, HUD and its state and local partners investigated more than 4,500 disability-related complaints, nearly 55 percent of all fair housing complaints.
April 2018 marked the 50th anniversary of the passage of the Fair Housing Act. This year, HUD, local communities, housing advocates, and fair housing organizations across the country are conducting a variety of activities to enhance awareness of fair housing rights, highlight HUD's fair housing enforcement efforts, and end housing discrimination in the nation. For a list of activities, visit www.hud.gov/fairhousingis50.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in housing because of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, disability and familial status. People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to www.hud.gov/fairhousing."

NOTICE
With the April 2018 release, seasonally adjusted estimates of housing units authorized by building permits will be revised back to January 2012, and seasonally adjusted estimates of housing units authorized but not started, started, under construction, and completed will be revised back to January 2013. With each April release, seasonally adjusted data will now be revised for an additional five years beyond the revision period for unadjusted data. Research has shown that this revision span should produce more reliable seasonally adjusted time series.
EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take three months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, six months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2 percent) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percentage change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percentage changes are 90 percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percentage changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised 3 percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at the Census Bureau's website (https://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/how_the_data_are_collected/index.html).
* The 90 percent confidence interval includes zero. In such cases, there is insufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero."
06/21/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-058.cfm,HUD Offers Over $212 Million in Grants to Clean Up Lead and Other Housing-Related Health Hazards,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today announced that it is making more than $212 million in grants available to help eliminate dangerous lead-based paint hazards from the homes of lower income families. These grants are intended to protect young children from lead poisoning and provide an opportunity for states and local communities to set up programs to control health and safety hazards by assessing and remediating lead-based paint and other housing related health hazards.
""Making these grants accessible to communities around the nation will lead to healthier outcomes for families and children,"" said Matt Ammon, Director of the Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes. ""These grants will help to unlock the potential of America's future. It is all about the kids, and it's all about ensuring they have a foundation and an environment for life that contributes to their ability to thrive.""
Unsafe and unhealthy homes affect the health of millions of people of all income levels, geographic areas, and walks of life in the U.S. These conditions affect the economy directly, through increased utilization of health care services, and indirectly, through lost wages and increased school days missed. The housing improvements that communities make using these grants will help prevent illnesses and injuries, reduce associated health care and social services costs, reduce absentee rates for children in school and adults at work, and reduce stress, all which help to improve the quality of life.
HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes promotes local efforts to eliminate dangerous lead paint and other housing-related health and safety hazards from lower income homes, stimulate private sector investment in lead hazard control, support cutting-edge research on methods for assessing and controlling housing-related health and safety hazards, and educate the public about the dangers of hazards in the home.
The grants to states and local governments are being offered through HUD's Lead-Based Paint Hazard Control Program totaling $180 million. HUD is providing nearly $32 million in healthy homes supplemental funds to identify and remediate additional housing related health hazards in homes with lead-based paint hazards.
HUD requires prospective grantees to submit their applications electronically at www.grants.gov. Any changes to HUD-published funding notices will be made available to the public through a Federal Register publication and published on this government-wide portal. Applicants are urged to sign up for Grants.gov's notification service to receive periodic updates or changes to these grant offerings."

In November, HUD Deputy Secretary Pamela Hughes Patenaude announced the allocation of more than $5 billion to the Lone Star State to support long-term recovery efforts.
The Texas plan is funded through HUD's Community Development Block Grant-Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) Program which requires grantees to develop a thoughtful recovery program informed by local residents. Learn more about CDBG-DR and the State's role in long-term disaster recovery (https://youtu.be/Lrmwz8IXXdQ) (en español (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uuy63y45L7s)).
""The Trump Administration is committed to helping Texans impacted by Harvey to rebuild their homes and their lives,"" said Secretary Carson. ""As the State now turns to the long-term recovery of its communities, Texans can be sure that HUD will be there to help in any way we can to make the state whole again.""
To address remaining needs in hard-hit areas of the state, the Texas recovery plan includes:
Single-Family Homeowner Assistance Program ($1.1 billion): Provides assistance to help homeowners with rehabilitation and reconstruction after Hurricane Harvey. Buyouts and Acquisitions ($275 million): To allow certain eligible homeowners to sell their damaged home to a local government. Affordable Rental ($250 million): Provides funding for rehabilitation, reconstruction and new construction of affordable multi-family rent properties. Homeowner Reimbursement ($100 million): Homeowners may be reimbursed up to $50,000 for certain out-of-pocket expenses incurred for home repairs, including reconstruction, rehabilitation or mitigation. Partial Repair and Essential Power for Sheltering ($73 million): Provides immediate, temporary repairs to homes that sustained less than $17,000 in FEMA-verified loss. CDBG-DR will be used as matching funds to FEMA expenditures. Local Infrastructure ($413 million): Supports infrastructure repairs and enhancements for local communities as part of a comprehensive long-term recovery program along with FEMA funding. Economic Revitalization ($100 million): Offers interim assistance up to $250,000 to small businesses in exchange for job creation or retention.

06/25/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-062.cfm,HUD Deputy Secretary Patenaude Opens Environmental Health Conference,"ANAHEIM, CA - U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Deputy Secretary Pamela Hughes Patenaude today spoke during the opening session of the National Environmental Health Association's (NEHA) annual conference about the nexus between health and housing with NEHA Executive Director and CEO David T. Dyjack, Dr.PH, CIH.
""Identifying and addressing housing hazards that have an impact on the health of children and families is a top priority for Secretary Carson and the Department,"" said HUD Deputy Secretary Patenaude. ""With the help of our grantees and partners, HUD's lead hazard control and healthy homes programs are meeting critical needs in communities where no other resources exist to address substandard housing that threatens the health of vulnerable residents. Equally important is restoring safe housing in communities hard-hit by natural disasters.""
Patenaude joined Dyjack on stage to speak before an estimated 1,400 environmental health professionals on the first day of NEHA's Annual Education Conference. NEHA co-hosts its conference with HUD every two years.
""We're honored to have a long and lasting relationship with HUD,"" said Dyjack. ""There's so much in housing today that needs to be addressed in order to mitigate health risks, whether it's the lead abatement efforts in older housing, or as we heard from Deputy Secretary Patenaude today, responding to natural disasters that destroy or damage housing. We have a close partnership with HUD on all those initiatives.""
There are an estimated 90,000 people employed in the U.S. in environmental health fields, with work that ranges from inspecting restaurant kitchens, public pools and tattoo parlors, to controlling mosquitos, testing for radon and monitoring the quality of municipal drinking water.
For more than 80 years, NEHA has served the American public by upholding a credentialing standard that is recognized around the world, achieved only through NEHA-proctored exams. NEHA-credentialed environmental health workers must be able to demonstrate a professional mastery of the environmental health field.
Patenaude brings more than 30 years of experience in housing, economic development and public policy to HUD. Prior, served as President of the J. Ronald Terwilliger Foundation for Housing America's Families, a nonprofit working to raise awareness of America's affordable housing crisis. She has also served the Bipartisan Policy Center, the Urban Land Institute (ULI) and the ULI Terwilliger Center for Workforce Housing."
06/26/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-063.cfm,HUD Warns California Landlords for Failing to Comply with Lead Safety Regulations,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced it issued notices of violation against the owners of eight HUD-assisted properties throughout California for violations of HUD's lead safety rules and regulations.
These latest enforcement efforts are part of HUD's Protect Our Kids! campaign, which was announced by Secretary Carson earlier this month. This Department-wide enforcement campaign is working to ensure that all federally assisted homes are lead-safe and that landlords of older homes are fulfilling their responsibilities to disclose lead-based paint hazards in their properties.
""Landlords have a responsibility to ensure the homes they rent to their tenants are safe and healthy places to live,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""These rules are designed to protect families and their young children from the preventable dangers associated with lead poisoning.""
HUD's enforcement campaign seeks to ensure compliance with the Lead Disclosure Rule and Lead Safe Housing Rule, which are intended to reduce the potential of lead poisoning in children in both privately owned homes and those that receive federal assistance.
Under HUD's and the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Lead Disclosure Rule, most landlords and home sellers of homes built before 1978 are required to inform tenants and purchasers of any known lead-based paint or lead-based paint hazards in the home. HUD's Lead Safe Housing Rule requires providers of most pre-1978 housing that is federally owned or receiving Federal assistance to make certain their units are lead safe.
As part of the Protect our Kids! campaign, HUD is taking the following actions to ensure compliance with these rules:

06/27/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-061.cfm,HUD Charges Alabama Property Management Company and Its Property Manager with Discriminating Against Families with Children,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has charged Mobile, Alabama-based Bienville Property Management, Inc., which does business as Showhomes Mobile and Baldwin Counties, and its property manager with violating the Fair Housing Act by refusing to rent a single-family, three-bedroom house to a woman because she has three young children. Read HUD's charge.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to discriminate against families with children, including unlawfully denying or limiting housing, making discriminatory statements, or imposing discriminatory rules or policies.
""Rules that limit the number of children in housing violate the Fair Housing Act,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Today's action reaffirms HUD's commitment to protecting the right of families with children to obtain the housing of their choice.""
The case came to HUD's attention when the woman filed a complaint alleging that Showhomes refused to rent to her because she had more than two minor children. Tests conducted by the Center for Fair Housing, an organization located in Mobile that helps individuals who face housing discrimination, revealed that Showhomes refused to rent to testers who claimed to have more than two minor children. HUD's charge on behalf of the woman alleges that Showhomes' rental policies discriminate against families with children by limiting the number of children to two or fewer, even when rental homes have three or more bedrooms, enough to accommodate families with more than two children.
""The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from restricting the number of children in its properties,"" said Paul Compton, HUD's General Counsel. ""HUD will continue to vigorously enforce the Act to protect families with children.""
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party elects for the case to be heard in federal court. If the administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages to the complainant for her loss as a result of the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties in order to vindicate the public interest.
April 2018 marked the 50th anniversary of the Fair Housing Act. In commemoration, HUD, local communities, housing advocates, and fair housing organizations across the country have coordinated a variety of activities to enhance awareness of fair housing rights, highlight HUD's fair housing enforcement efforts, and end housing discrimination in the nation. For a list of planned activities, log onto www.hud.gov/fairhousingis50.
Persons who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY)."

For the fourth consecutive year, HUD and NEHA identified outstanding local programs and research that promote healthier housing through education, partnering, and innovative practices. HUD has a strong partnership with NEHA based on a common vision of creating healthier home environments by working across the health, environment, and housing sectors. The award was initiated in 2015 to showcase results achieved under a wide range of housing and indoor environmental health programs.
Nominations and applications were received from academic institutions, state government agencies, housing authorities, and community-based organizations. NEHA's Technical Advisors, a distinguished six-judge panel representing a cross-section of experts for the healthy homes community evaluated entries.
Criteria for winning the awards include demonstration of the health impact on population, policy/program innovations, impact on the physical environment, economic sustainability, partnership/collaboration, and measurability.
The Awardees are:
Green and Healthy Homes Initiative, Baltimore, MD (Cross-Program)
Founded in 1986, GHHI has grown to be a national leader in the healthy homes and integrated and health and energy field. In 1999, GHHI launched one of the nation's first healthy homes programs that offered resident education, environment assessment and housing interventions to remediate asthma triggers, household injury risks and other homes-based environmental health hazards. Since 1993, GHHI has directly served more than 20,000 clients and completed over 4,000 healthy homes interventions in the homes of low income families in Baltimore City as well as providing technical assistance to 45 cities and states on successful healthy homes strategies.
GHHI has worked with jurisdictions to generate over $300 million in philanthropic, private, corporate support and public support for healthy homes services.
Fort Collins Healthy Homes Program and DIY Assessment Tool, Fort Collins, CO (Policy and Education Innovation)
Recognizing the implications of poor indoor air quality on human health and productivity, the City of Fort Collins' Healthy Homes program was established in 2011 as an innovative solution to address residential indoor air quality. The program is unique in that it is driven by community members who volunteer their time as Master Home Educators. Since 2011, over 800 in-home assessments have been conducted and 2,475 residents, 19% of whom have asthma, have been reached. In order to reach more residents, the program created an online DIY Home Assessment Tool which is patterned after the Healthy Homes in-home assessment and focuses on the ""Eight Principles of a Healthy Home."" This interactive and customizable tool (https://healthyhomes.fcgov.com/) walks residents through each area of their home, asking specific questions as it relates to indoor air quality problems and provides low and no-cost adv. These include ventilation, mold, pests, chemical contaminants, cleanliness, and home maintenance and safety.
Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority/Thurgood Marshall Apartments, Milwaukee, WI (Public Housing)
Thurgood Marshall Apartments in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, takes an innovative approach to the seemingly hopeless dilemma of chronic homelessness. The Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority administers the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program, one of the funding sources. The new construction project provides 24 one-bedroom units of permanent supporting housing for very low-income adults who are chronically homeless and who suffer from chronic alcoholism. Since 2008, with the creation of more than 600 units for individuals who have either been homeless or at risk of homelessness, Milwaukee County has made substantial progress in the development of supportive housing.
North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC; and Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, New Orleans, LA (Research)
This award recognizes excellence in Healthy Homes research, and long-term commitment to the enhancement of Healthy Homes concepts through education and outreach. The work highlights the joint efforts of Dr. Coby Schal at NC State and Dr. Felicia Rabito at Tulane on investigating the role of cockroaches on the quality of homes in the inner city, and on their roles in asthma morbidity in low income children in the United States. This unique collaboration combines the efforts of academic researchers who work across the health, environment, and housing sectors. A major innovation of their work was the linkage of entomologist and environmental epidemiologists, that enables a deeper understanding of how to eradicate cockroach infestations using the lower toxicity approaches, significantly reduce household allergens, and improve children's health.
HUD Secretary Ben Carson said, ""These awards collectively underscore the vital need to strengthen public understanding of the link between health and housing. Our awardees have uniquely contributed to increasing this awareness, and our partners who submitted nominations are making inroads every day towards improving the quality of lives.""

06/28/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-065.cfm,HUD Approves $616 Million Florida Disaster Recovery Plan,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson today announced he is approving a disaster recovery plan (http://www.floridajobs.org/community-planning-and-development/assistance-for-governments-and-organizations/disaster-recovery-initiative) to help Floridians recover from Hurricane Irma. In November, HUD allocated $616 million to the Sunshine State to support long-term recovery efforts.
The Florida action plan approved today is funded through HUD's Community Development Block Grant-Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) Program which requires grantees to develop a thoughtful recovery program informed by local residents. Learn more about CDBG-DR and the State's role in long-term disaster recovery (https://youtu.be/Lrmwz8IXXdQ) (en español (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uuy63y45L7s)).
""This funding is part of the Trump Administration's continued commitment to helping the residents of Florida impacted by Irma to recover and rebuild their homes and their lives,"" said Secretary Carson. ""As we move along the road to recovery, HUD will be right by Florida's side to help in any way we can to make the state whole again.""
Governor Rick Scott said, ""It's great news that we were able to secure critical funding from HUD that will directly benefit the families who were most affected by last year's storms. This $616 million will enable communities to build new affordable housing and to replace homes lost in the wake of last year's hurricane season. Through this program, we can continue to move forward with long-term affordable housing solutions for displaced families as well as provide grants to businesses who were impacted by the storm. We won't stop working until all of Florida's communities have fully recovered.""
To address unmet needs, the State of Florida has identified several housing and economic development recovery needs arising from Hurricane Irma and has designed the following programs to address those unmet needs and assist in the recovery:
Housing Repair Program ($273.3 million) will rehabilitate housing occupied by low- and moderate-income families that was damaged by Hurricane Irma. The Florida Department of Economic Opportunity (DEO) will centrally manage the following activities on behalf of eligible homeowner and rental property owner applicants: Repairs to, reconstruction or replacement of housing units damaged by Hurricane Irma, which may include bringing the home into code compliance and mitigation against future storm impacts, including elevation. The completion of work to homes that have been partially repaired. Repairs to, or replacement of, manufactured homes impacted by Hurricane Irma. Temporary housing assistance based on individual household needs and their participation in the Housing Repair Program. Workforce Affordable Rental New Construction Program ($100 million) will facilitate the creation of affordable rental housing though a partnership with DEO and the Florida Housing Finance Corporation by leveraging CDBG-DR funds with low-income housing tax credits as well using CDBG-DR funds for zero-interest loans for smaller developments. Land Acquisition for Affordable Workforce Housing ($20 million) provides funding for the purchase of land for development into affordable housing, especially in areas of the state where the scarcity of developable land makes it difficult to construct properties that can be rented at an affordable rate for the community's workforce. Voluntary Home Buyout Program ($75 million) encourages risk reduction through the voluntary purchase of residential properties in high flood-risk areas. Communities that participate in this program are encouraged to develop plans for the reuse of the acquired land to further reduce flood risk and/or serve as a recreational space for the public. Recovery Workforce Training Program ($20 million) will bolster workforce training throughout the state with the goal of growing the skilled labor force needed to support the long-term recovery, primarily in the housing construction field. Business Recovery Grant Program ($60 million) provides funding for eligible business owners who are seeking reimbursement for the cost of replacing equipment and inventory damaged by Hurricane Irma. Business Assistance to new Floridians from Puerto Rico ($6 million) provides business plan guidance, accounting services, licensing information and other resources to support assistance in assimilating to the business climate in the State of Florida.

07/02/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-066.cfm,"HUD Charges New York Developer, Owner, Construction Company, and Architect with Discriminating Against Persons with Disabilities","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it charged a New York-based developer, owner, construction company and architect with housing discrimination for failing to design and construct a condominium development in the Long Island City area of Queens, New York, in compliance with the accessibility requirements of the Fair Housing Act. Read HUD's charge.
The Fair Housing Act requires that multifamily housing built after March 1991 contain accessible features for people with disabilities. Requirements include accessible common areas, bathrooms and kitchens, as well as wider doors and environmental controls that can be reached by residents who use wheelchairs. The failure to include these features is unlawful and makes the property difficult or impossible to use by people with disabilities.
""It can be very difficult for persons with disabilities to live in housing that does not meet the Fair Housing Act's design and construction requirements,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""If, for example, a unit has stairs at its entry, that unit is effectively unavailable to persons with mobility impairments.""
""These accessibility requirements have been in effect since 1991 so responsible developers and construction professionals know well how to comply with them,"" said Paul Compton, HUD's General Counsel. ""This Charge represents HUD's commitment to ensuring the residential construction industry designs and builds housing that is reasonably accessible to persons with disabilities.""
HUD's charge resulted from a fair housing complaint that was filed by a resident of the 5th Street Lofts Condominium in Queens, New York, alleging that the developers and architect had designed and constructed the building with numerous inaccessible features, a violation of the Fair Housing Act. During its investigation, HUD conducted an on-site inspection of the 5th Street Lofts and discovered extensive design and construction deficiencies.
According to HUD's charge, Toll Brothers Real Estate, Inc., 5-01-5-17 48th Avenue LLC, and Sordoni Construction Co., and their architect, Henry T. O'Hara Jr., allegedly discriminated against persons with disabilities because 5th Street Lofts lacked safe and accessible routes that persons with disabilities and others can use to travel between their units and common areas. Specifically, deficiencies were found in the property's main entrance, hallways connecting common areas, shared outdoor terrace, patios, refuse rooms, and parking garage. Moreover, HUD found widespread violations inside individual units, including inaccessible doors, bathrooms, kitchens, and environmental controls.
The charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party elects for the case to be heard in federal court. If the administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he or she may award damages to the individual complainant for his or her loss as a result of the discrimination. The judge may also order retrofits at the inaccessible properties, and other injunctive or equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties to vindicate the public interest.
This year marks the 50th anniversary of the passage of the Fair Housing Act and the 30th anniversary of the Act's amendment to prohibit discrimination against persons with disabilities. This year, HUD, local communities, housing advocates, and fair housing organizations across the country are conducting a variety of activities to enhance awareness of fair housing rights, highlight HUD's fair housing enforcement efforts, and end housing discrimination in the nation. Read more at https://www.hud.gov/fairhousingis50.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in housing because of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, disability and familial status. People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to www.hud.gov/fairhousing."

07/13/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-068.cfm,HUD Awards $43 Million to Help End Youth Homelessness,"WASHINGTON - To help end youth homelessness, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is awarding $43 million to 11 local communities, including five rural areas, through its Youth Homelessness Demonstration Program (YHDP). This program supports a wide range of housing interventions including rapid rehousing, permanent supportive housing, transitional housing, and host homes.
""Young people who are victims of abuse, family conflict, or aging out of foster care are especially vulnerable to homelessness,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""We're working with our local partners to support innovative new approaches to help young people find stable housing, break the cycle of homelessness and lead them on a path to self-sufficiency.""
To ensure the Youth Homelessness Demonstration Program meets the needs of young people, HUD relied upon the recommendations of young people who experienced homelessness themselves. Many of the same youth participated in reviewing the applications of communities seeking YHDP funds. Their input helped ensure that the communities selected for funding understand the needs and preferences of the young people they will serve. HUD also worked closely with its federal partners at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Department of Education (DOE), and the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH) to help develop the program and review applications.
The 11 communities selected will collaborate with a broad array of partners including a youth action board and the local or state public child welfare agency. These communities now have four months to develop and submit to HUD a coordinated community plan to prevent and end youth homelessness. They will also participate in a program evaluation to inform the federal effort to prevent and end youth homelessness going forward and will serve as leaders in the nation on the work to end homelessness among young people.
YHDP recipients will use funding for rapid rehousing, permanent supportive housing, and transitional housing, and to fund innovative programs, such as host homes. Recipients can begin requesting funding for specific projects as soon as they are ready. YHDP will also support youth-focused performance measurement and coordinated entry systems. Over the next several months, selected communities will work with their youth advisory boards, child welfare agencies, and other community partners to create a comprehensive community plan to end youth homelessness.
HUD is awarding grants to the following communities where local applicants expressed their own vision for ending youth homelessness:
San Diego, California: $7.94 million
The Regional Task Force on the Homeless and their members have demonstrated success addressing homelessness through specific initiatives targeting specific homeless subpopulations. For example, San Diego and San Diego County are implementing a Youth Coordinated Entry System (CES) to match housing and services to the needs of young people, specifically those experiencing unsheltered homelessness.
Louisville, Kentucky: $3.45 million
This Continuum of Care (CoC) has a strong history of coordinating stakeholders to create systemic change in the homeless service system resulting in cutting the chronically homeless population in half. It has worked to effectively end veteran homelessness and has been working to make systemic change in addressing homelessness among youth since 2016 through the Homeless Youth Committee of the Louisville CoC.
Boston, Massachusetts: $4.92 million
Boston seeks to transition from a city where multiple programs individually serve Youth and Young Adults (YYA) at-risk of and experiencing homelessness, to a city with a coordinated, resourced, and data-informed system with common vision and goals. HUD is supporting this transition.
NW Minnesota (Rural): $1.41 million
Given the significant system changes involved and the specific challenges associated with the rural nature of its region and desire to assure the participation and respect the sovereignty of three Tribes, this Continuum of Care employs a single prioritization list and participation of nearly all homeless-dedicated beds.
Nebraska (Rural): $3.28 million
The mission of the Connected Youth Initiative (CYI) is to bring young people together with service providers, funders and decision-makers to create supportive communities committed to improving outcomes for youth ages 14-24 with foster care, juvenile justice or homelessness experiences. It is designed to build strong collaborations and infrastructure necessary for community ownership of youth well-being and the realization of improved youth outcomes.
Northern New Mexico (Rural): $3.37 million
Many local communities and pueblos in New Mexico have demonstrated a philosophical, political, and financial commitment to confronting social inequities, particularly as they affect underserved populations and children. Youth Services and Family Services, along with its partners, are proposing to extend this commitment through tested methodologies and novel approaches to a web of communities in a 14-county region. This rural outreach aims to join a national effort of like-minded individuals, groups, and municipalities to end youth homelessness.
Columbus, Ohio: $6.07 million
The Youth Action Board (YAB) and Youth Committee vision is for all youth to have a safe place to call home. Successful achievement of this vision in this community means all youth will have immediate and easy access to the support they need to prevent homelessness or, if needed, will have immediate and easy access to crisis housing and services to ensure that homeless episodes are rare, brief, and one-time.
Nashville, Tennessee: $3.54 million
The creation of the Key Action Plan represents a clear shift in Nashville and Davidson County, where the problem of youth homelessness is more broadly recognized and embraced beyond a small number of Youth and Young Adult (YYA) providers. With the direct support of more than 20 diverse stakeholders - including a wide range of community-based organizations, systems, and Young Adult (YA) - Nashville's Continuum of Care has increasingly tested new strategies and methodologies as it works to expand housing options for at-risk young people and to build momentum toward ending youth homelessness.
Vermont (Rural): $2 million
The Youth Homelessness Prevention Plan Committee (YHPPC) has engaged youth and youth providers in planning; conducted a youth baseline needs assessment; and incorporated youth perspectives into the Continuum of Care's Coordinated Entry policies and procedures.
Washington (Rural): $4.63 million
Washington State has one of the strongest commitments to addressing youth homelessness in the nation. Ongoing strategic efforts include: preventing youth from exiting public systems of care (such as child welfare and juvenile justice) into homelessness; developing a crisis response system for families and youth in conflict; and closing educational equity gaps for homeless students.
Snohomish, Washington: $2.39 million
The Snohomish County Human Services Department (HSD) will build on successful innovative practices that have transformed the Everett/Snohomish County Continuum of Care homeless response system, to further transform the homeless youth response under the Youth Homeless Demonstration Program."

NOTICE
With the April 2018 release, seasonally adjusted estimates of housing units authorized by building permits will be revised back to January 2012, and seasonally adjusted estimates of housing units authorized but not started, started, under construction, and completed will be revised back to January 2013. With each April release, seasonally adjusted data will now be revised for an additional five years beyond the revision period for unadjusted data. Research has shown that this revision span should produce more reliable seasonally adjusted time series.
EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take three months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, six months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2 percent) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percentage change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percentage changes are 90 percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percentage changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised 3 percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at the Census Bureau's website (https://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/how_the_data_are_collected/index.html).
* The 90 percent confidence interval includes zero. In such cases, there is insufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero."
07/18/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-073.cfm,HUD Approves Agreement with Mobile Housing Board Resolving Claims of Disability Discrimination,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has approved a Voluntary Compliance/Conciliation Agreement between Mobile Housing Board (MHB), in Mobile, AL, and a woman with disabilities. The agreement resolves allegations that the Board denied the woman's request for a Housing Choice Voucher.
The agreement also addresses the findings of a compliance review HUD conducted, which found that the board failed to meet the statutory and regulatory requirements of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and Section 3 of the Housing and Development Act of 1968. Read the agreement.
Section 504 and HUD's implementing regulations require that five percent of the dwelling units in multifamily housing projects, or at least one unit, whichever is greater, be accessible for persons with mobility impairments. An additional two percent of the dwelling units, or at least one unit, whichever is greater, must be accessible for persons with hearing or visual impairments. Units must also be constructed in accordance with the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (https://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/buildings-and-sites/about-the-aba-standards/background/ufas?highlight=WyJ1ZmFzIl0=) or HUD's Deeming Notice, the Fair Housing Act, and the Americans with Disabilities Act.
In addition. Section 3 requires that recipients of HUD funds, to the greatest extent feasible, direct employment and other economic opportunities generated by certain HUD covered projects and activities to low- and very-low income persons and to businesses that hire them.
""When organizations that control access to housing fail to meet their responsibilities under the nation's housing laws, it makes finding suitable housing even more difficult, especially for persons with disabilities,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""The agreement we are announcing today is yet another example of HUD's commitment to meeting its obligation to protect the rights of individuals and families seeking housing.""
The case began when a woman with disabilities filed a complaint with HUD alleging that the MHB, which provides and administers affordable housing programs for the residents of Mobile, violated her housing rights. HUD's review of MHB's voucher program found that it denied individuals the opportunity to use Housing Choice Vouchers. In addition, a subsequent Compliance Review conducted by HUD found that MHB failed to build units in accordance with the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards, and failed to abide by the hiring and employment requirements of the Section 3 program.
Under the terms of the agreement, MHB will pay the woman $117,500; issue her a Housing Choice Voucher; and allocate $114,000 for Section 504-related improvements at the Downtown Renaissance ($61,500), Renaissance Gardens ($19,200); and The Renaissance ($33,300). The agreement also requires MHB to appoint a qualified individual to serve as MHB's Section 3 coordinator and assist contractors with the development of Section 3 plans needed to qualify for contracting opportunities.
Persons who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to www.hud.gov/fairhousing."
07/19/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-071.cfm,HUD Awards $144 Million to Revitalize Five Neighborhoods,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson today announced five communities across the country will receive a combined $144 million to redevelop severely distressed public or assisted housing and to revitalize surrounding neighborhoods. Provided through HUD's Choice Neighborhoods Initiative, these grants, and the more than $1 billion they will stimulate from other sources, will transform long-struggling neighborhoods and distressed HUD-assisted housing.
Secretary Carson announced that the following communities are selected to receive Choice Neighborhoods grants to implement their neighborhood transformation plans:
Read more about these communities' transformation plans.
""Choice Neighborhoods Grants are significant investments to transform struggling neighborhoods and improve living conditions for thousands of families,"" said Secretary Carson. ""The public dollars we award today will generate major investment to revitalize entire neighborhoods and create more opportunities for those who live there.""
HUD's Choice Neighborhoods Initiative leverages significant public and private dollars to support locally driven strategies that address struggling neighborhoods with distressed public or HUD-assisted
housing through a comprehensive approach to neighborhood transformation. Local leaders, residents, and stakeholders, such as public housing authorities, cities, schools, police, business owners, nonprofits, and private developers, come together to create and implement a plan that revitalizes distressed HUD housing and addresses the challenges in the surrounding neighborhood. The program helps communities transform neighborhoods by revitalizing severely distressed public and/or assisted housing and catalyzing critical improvements in the neighborhood, including vacant property, housing, businesses, services and schools.
Choice Neighborhoods is focused on three core goals:
1. Housing: Replace distressed public and assisted housing with high-quality mixed-income housing that is well-managed and responsive to the needs of the surrounding neighborhood;
2. People: Improve outcomes of households living in the target housing related to employment and income, health, and children's education; and
3. Neighborhood: Create the conditions necessary for public and private reinvestment in distressed neighborhoods to offer the kinds of amenities and assets, including safety, good schools, and commercial activity, that are important to families' choices about their community.
The five awardees will replace 1,788 severely distressed public housing units with 3,800 new mixed-income, mixed-use housing units as part of an overall effort to revitalize neighborhoods. For every $1 in Choice Neighborhoods funding they receive, the awardees and their partners will leverage an additional $9.40 in public and private funding for their project proposals. Together, these five communities are leveraging an initial $1.35 billion through other public/private sources to magnify their impact.
Choice Neighborhoods builds on the successes of HUD's HOPE VI Program, linking housing improvements with a wide variety of public services and neighborhood improvements to create neighborhoods of opportunity. Choice Neighborhoods is HUD's signature place-based program, which supports innovative and inclusive strategies that bring public and private partners together to help break the cycle of intergenerational poverty."

07/23/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-074.cfm,HUD and DOJ Launch Public Awareness Campaign Against Sexual Harassment in Housing,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) today released a public service announcement (PSA) to raise awareness of housing-related sexual harassment and to reach persons who are victimized by it. To enhance the effectiveness of the campaign, HUD enlisted the assistance of victims to share their experiences and help convey the message that sexual harassment in housing is against the law. Watch the public service announcement (PSA) (https://youtu.be/-R3Q8ewWJas).
The 60-second PSA features three victims of sexual harassment who challenged their mistreatment in lawsuits brought by HUD under the Fair Housing Act. These women share their stories of abuse and the impact the experience they had on their lives.
Stephanie is one victim featured in the video, describing her experience with a landlord who threatened to evict her if she didn't have sex with him. ""It was something that I didn't want to do but I had to do it. I didn't know I had a choice at that time, but now that I do, I want other people to know that they do. I want other women to know that they don't have to take this. This is just uncalled for. It's unspeakable.""
""A person's home is where they should feel the safest, not to live in fear of being subjected to sexual harassment,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""This campaign will let the public know that they have help should they find themselves a victim of this type of behavior. The Justice Department and HUD are committed to working together to address the problem and protect their housing rights.""
""Unfortunately, there are still too many landlords and managers who attempt to prey on vulnerable individuals. The launch of the nationwide PSAs is an important step in proliferating the stories of brave women and men across the country in order to raise awareness and help other victims,"" said John Gore, Acting Assistant Attorney General of the Civil Rights Division. ""Our goal at the Justice Department is to make more people aware that no one should have to choose between a home and the right to be free from sexual harassment.""
The PSA released today is a joint effort between HUD and DOJ to raise awareness and make it easier for victims all over the country to find resources and report harassment. HUD will distribute the video to all Public Housing Agencies across the United States. The video is intended to air in all national media markets and will be distributed by social media to followers of HUD and the Justice Department, and amplified by other government agencies, partners, and organizations.
Last April, HUD and DOJ launched a campaign to combat sexual harassment in housing including three major components: a new HUD-DOJ Task Force to combat sexual harassment in housing; an outreach toolkit to leverage DOJ's nationwide network of U.S. Attorney's Offices, and; a public awareness campaign. The Department and HUD are working together to distribute the PSA as part of the Task Force's coordinated public outreach efforts.
Individuals who believe that they may have been victims of sexual harassment in housing should call the Department at (844) 380-6178, send an email to fairhousing@usdoj.gov, or contact HUD at (800) 669-9777. If you have information or questions about any other housing discrimination, you can contact the Department at (800) 896-7743."

In addition, HUD approved a Voluntary Compliance Agreement (VCA) resolving findings which indicated that Hawaii Public Housing Authority failed to provide enough accessible units for residents with disabilities. Read the agreement.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to discriminate in the sale, rental, and financing of dwellings, and in other housing-related transactions, based on disability. This includes refusing to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services or facilities related to housing. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance.
""Denying persons with disabilities the accommodations they need or failing to build accessible housing violates the law,"" said Anna María Farías HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Hopefully, the settlements we're announcing today will help housing providers recognize their obligation to comply with the nation's fair housing laws and make a commitment to meeting that obligation.""
The agreements announced today are:
Rancho Cordova, California
HUD approved a Conciliation Agreement with the owners of Fountain Crest Apartments settling allegations that the owners demanded that a tenant with disabilities remove her assistance animal from the property. Among other things, the Conciliation Agreement provides that the tenant will receive $10,000 and the property owners will revise their reasonable accommodation policies and receive training to ensure compliance with the Fair Housing Act.
San Diego, California
HUD approved a Conciliation Agreement with the owners of Summit at Alpine Apartment Homes Limited Partnership and Property West Residential Management Company resolving allegations that they denied a tenant's reasonable accommodation request to move to a ground-floor unit due to a mobility disability. Under the agreement, Property West Residential Management Company will pay the woman $6,500. In addition, leasing and management staff at Summit at Alpine Apartment Homes Limited Partnership and Property West Residential Management Company will undergo fair housing training.
Pocatello, Idaho
HUD approved a Conciliation Agreement with the owners of rental properties in Pocatello, settling allegations that they denied the request of a tenant with disabilities to keep an emotional support animal. The tenant alleged that the owners initially denied her request, but later agreed to grant her request, imposing numerous terms and conditions that violated the Fair Housing Act. Under the agreement, the owners will pay the woman $6,000 and revise their rental procedures to be consistent with the Fair Housing Act.
Honolulu, Hawaii
HUD approved a Voluntary Compliance Agreement (VCA) between the Hawaii Disability Rights Center and the Hawaii Public Housing Authority (HPHA). Under the VCA, HPHA will work cooperatively to resolve issues pertaining to a compliance review which found that HPHA failed to comply with the requirements of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Among other findings, the compliance review revealed that HPHA did not have an adequate percentage of accessible units available for residents with disabilities. Also under the VCA, HPHA will contract with an expert accessibility consultant to ensure that it meets its accessibility mandates, including conducting assessments of residents' accommodation needs.
Persons who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to www.hud.gov/fairhousing."

HUD and the AIA selected affordable housing developments in California and Oregon for their overall excellence in either affordable housing design or housing accessibility.
""I want to recognize these outstanding developments for their architectural ingenuity and the impact that they're making on their communities,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""These developments not only provide critically needed affordable housing to low-income families and individuals with disabilities, they prove affordable housing can be attractive and responsive to the needs of their communities.""
The new HUD Secretary's Housing and Community Design Award recipients are:
Excellence in Affordable Housing Design - This award recognizes architecture that demonstrates overall excellence in terms of design in response to both the needs and constraints of affordable housing.
Five88 Apartments in San Francisco is a new 100 percent affordable housing development, skillfully constructed on a coastal landfill. The development includes 200 apartments for low-income families in the developing Mission Bay area. Built on challenging landscape the architectural design of the development is both innovative and visually striking.
The building transitions from four stories on one side to three on the other. From uniquely tilted stairs to a bamboo exterior, this affordable housing unit combines functionality with an aesthetic appeal. Five88 includes 10,000-square feet of retail space aiding in the development of the community. This development is transit-oriented and focused on enabling low-income families to move closer to the city and the places most important to them.
Housing Accessibility - Alan J. Rothman Award - The purpose of this award is to recognize exemplary projects that demonstrate excellence in improving housing accessibility for people with disabilities.
The Station 162 Apartments near Portland, Oregon is the fifth housing project developed by QUAD, Inc (Quadriplegics United Against Dependency). The person behind this endeavor, Bud Myers, is himself quadriplegic and realized the critical shortage of independent housing developments to aid injured individuals transitioning to a life with disabilities. Ten years before the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act, with help from community resources he opened the first independent living center in the nation not affiliated with a hospital or rehabilitation center.
The Station 162 Apartments feature everything the Americans with Disabilities Act established including entirely barrier-free units and independent supportive services provided upon request.
Larger than Quad's previous developments, this complex was designed with the needs of their future residents in mind and has gained national attention for its efforts."

Puerto Rico recently submitted the plan for HUD's review which primarily focuses on the restoration of damaged and destroyed homes, businesses and infrastructure. Read Puerto Rico's recovery plan (http://www.cdbg-dr.pr.gov/en/action-plan-draft/).
Puerto Rico's long-term recovery is supported through HUD's Community Development Block Grant—Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) Program which requires grantees to develop thoughtful recovery plans informed by local residents. Learn more about CDBG-DR and the State's role in long-term disaster recovery (https://youtu.be/Lrmwz8IXXdQ) (en español (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uuy63y45L7s)).
""Today, we turn an important corner in our long-term effort to rebuild hard-hit communities in Puerto Rico,"" said Secretary Carson. ""This is just the beginning - billions in federal disaster recovery funding will soon be put to work and help our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico rebuild their homes and their lives.""
Background
On September 8, 2017, President Trump signed the Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements Act, 2017 (https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/601/text). The Act appropriated $7.4 billion in CDBG-DR funding for major disasters declared in 2017. To distribute these funds, the Act requires HUD to direct the funds to the areas most impacted by last year's major disasters. On February 1, 2018, HUD allocated $1.5 billion of that appropriation to Puerto Rico to address the serious unmet needs on the island. The action plan approved today will put these funds to work.
On April 10, 2018, HUD allocated another $18.5 billion to further support recovery in Puerto Rico and to rebuild communities impacted by Hurricanes Maria and Irma and to protect them from major disasters in the future. HUD will shortly publish program rules to guide Puerto Rico and others on the use of those funds.
CDBG-DR grants support a variety of disaster recovery activities including housing redevelopment and rebuilding, business assistance, economic revitalization, and infrastructure repair. Grantees are required to spend the majority of these recovery funds in ""most impacted"" areas as identified by HUD. HUD will issue administrative guidelines shortly for use of the funds to address grantees' long-term recovery needs, particularly in the area of housing recovery.
To address unmet needs, Puerto Rico identified several housing, infrastructure and economic development recovery needs arising from Hurricanes Irma and Maria. Puerto Rico's disaster recovery action plan includes the following activities:
Housing ($1 billion) - Puerto Rico is investing more than $1 billion to restore the island's severely damaged housing stock. As part of the plan, Puerto Rico intends to provide up to $120,000 to rebuild destroyed homes for each qualified homeowner and up to $48,000 to repair each eligible damaged property. Additional housing investments include funding for rental assistance ($10,000,000), specifically for properties serving the elderly and other vulnerable households. Puerto Rico has also proposed a $36 million Home Emergency Resilience Program that provides up to $6,000 per household for individual solar appliances to help families.

08/13/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-079.cfm,HUD Seeks to Streamline and Enhance 'Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing' Rule,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today published a notice inviting public comment on amendments to its Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing (AFFH) regulations. HUD's goal in pursuing new rulemaking is to offer more helpful guidance to states and local communities to effectively promote fair housing choice through the use of their federal funds. Read HUD's Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-08-16/pdf/2018-17671.pdf).
As HUD begins the process of amending the existing AFFH regulations, it is soliciting public comment on changes that will: (1) minimize regulatory burden while more effectively aiding program participants to meet their statutory obligations, (2) create a process focused primarily on accomplishing positive results, rather than on analysis, (3) provide for greater local control and innovation, (4) seek to encourage actions that increase housing choice, including through greater housing supply, and (5) more efficiently utilize HUD resources.
""HUD believes very deeply in the purposes of the Fair Housing Act and that states, local governments, and public housing authorities further fair housing choice,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""HUD's 2015 rule often dictated unworkable requirements and actually impeded the development and rehabilitation of affordable housing.""
""It's ironic that the current AFFH rule, which was designed to expand affordable housing choices, is actually suffocating investment in some of our most distressed neighborhoods that need our investment the most,"" Carson continued. ""We do not have to abandon communities in need. Instead we believe we can craft a new, fairer rule that creates choices for quality housing across all communities.""
""Today we begin the formal process of examining how we can get this regulation right by first listening and learning from those who must put these rules to work and live with its impact,"" Carson concluded.
Background
On July 16, 2015, HUD published its AFFH final rule. The stated purpose of that regulation was to provide HUD program participants with a revised planning approach to assist them in meeting their legal obligation to affirmatively further fair housing. Since then, HUD found that in contrast to its stated goals, the AFFH rule proved ineffective, highly prescriptive, and effectively discouraged the production of affordable housing.
Last January, HUD suspended the obligation of local governments to file plans under the regulation and, in May, withdrew a computer assessment tool required to be used by local governments in preparing those plans. HUD found that rather than assisting local governments in formulating acceptable fair housing assessments, the 'Local Government Assessment Tool' was confusing, difficult to use, contained errors, and frequently produced unacceptable assessments, and otherwise required an unsustainable level of technical assistance. HUD continues to review comments submitted in response to the withdrawal of the Local Government Assessment Tool. The Department will consider those comments during its consideration of potential changes to the AFFH regulations."
08/16/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-083.cfm,FHA Announces Updated Policy to Assist Homeowners Affected By 2017 Natural Disasters in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands,"WASHINGTON - To help struggling borrowers in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands impacted by Hurricanes Irma and Maria, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) today announced it is updating its menu of foreclosure prevention options to allow borrowers with delinquent FHA-insured mortgages easier access to bring their mortgages current without increasing their interest rates or monthly payments. FHA is also providing a final 30-day extension of its foreclosure moratorium to allow distressed FHA-insured homeowners in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands an opportunity to find a permanent mortgage resolution. Read FHA's letter to mortgage servicers.
In February, FHA introduced the Disaster Standalone Partial Claim option to help struggling borrowers impacted by 2017 natural disasters to resume their pre-disaster mortgage payments without payment shock. This option was intended to be used if all other home retention options were exhausted. Effectively immediately, FHA's ""Disaster Standalone Partial Claim"" will now be the first mortgage relief option available for hurricane victims with FHA-insured homes located in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
While some borrowers have already received payment relief in the form of a permanent loss mitigation, there are others in need of a permanent resolution who have not contacted their servicer for help or are on a temporary forbearance. The updated Disaster Standalone Partial Claim provides these borrowers with an opportunity to be immediately evaluated for a permanent loss mitigation solution that is affordable and sustainable. This option is the best solution for many borrowers seeking to cure arrearages and resume making payments without modifying their loan and re-amortizing the loan term.
The Disaster Standalone Partial Claim option covers missed mortgage payments up to 30 percent of Unpaid Principal Balance through an interest-free second loan on the mortgage, payable only when the borrower sells the home or refinances their mortgage. In addition, this option requires no trial period or balloon payment and allows borrowers to keep their existing interest rate and existing amortization schedule. FHA's Disaster Standalone Partial Claim also streamlines income documentation and other requirements to expedite relief to homeowners struggling to pay their mortgage while recovering from last year's disasters.
FHA borrowers may qualify for the updated Disaster Standalone Partial Claim if they meet the following conditions:
They live within the geographic boundaries of the applicable Presidentially declared disaster area in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands; Their ability to make mortgage payments is directly or substantially affected by the disaster; Their mortgage was no more than 60-days past due prior to the date of the Presidentially declared major disaster; and They have not already been approved for a forbearance or other loss mitigation option(s).
• They live within the geographic boundaries of the applicable Presidentially declared disaster area in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands;
• Their ability to make mortgage payments is directly or substantially affected by the disaster;
• Their mortgage was no more than 60-days past due prior to the date of the Presidentially declared major disaster; and
• They have not already been approved for a forbearance or other loss mitigation option(s).
To ensure that FHA-insured borrowers in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands are protected from foreclosure while applying for the updated assistance, FHA is providing a final 30-day extension of the foreclosure moratorium. HUD is instructing FHA-approved mortgage servicers to continue suspending all foreclosure actions against eligible FHA borrowers in the Presidentially Declared Major Disaster Areas until September 16, 2018. FHA does not intend to further extend the foreclosure moratoriums after this date, so FHA borrowers in the eligible areas needing assistance are strongly urged to contact their mortgage servicer immediately.
""We need borrowers to contact their servicers right away and begin the process of finding a permanent solution to their mortgage situation,"" said FHA Commissioner Brian Montgomery. ""We have a lot of options available to help FHA-insured families keep their homes but every day we wait, those options become more limited. Meanwhile, we intend to monitor our servicers very closely to make sure eligible families get the mortgage relief they qualify for.""
FHA also has several other options to help disaster victims recover, including:
Forbearance and loan modification options - HUD offers different forbearance and loan modification options for FHA borrowers affected by disasters. Borrowers having trouble making regular payments should contact their loan servicer as soon as possible for more information; FHA-insured Mortgage for Disaster Victims - HUD's Section 203(h) program provides an FHA insured mortgage loan to disaster victims who have lost their homes and are facing the daunting task of rebuilding or buying another home. Borrowers must work with a participating FHA-approved lender in order to be considered for 100 percent financing, including closing costs; and FHA-insured Mortgage for home rehabilitation - HUD's Section 203(k) loan program enables those who have lost their homes to refinance a home or finance the purchase of a home along with its repair costs by using a single mortgage.

Some available units may be provided by HUD funded or subsidized Public Housing Agencies or Multi-Family owners. The Department will also connect FEMA and affected s states to subject matter experts to provide information on HUD programs.

08/17/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-080.cfm,"HUD Charges Minnesota Real-Estate Agent and Homeowners with Discrimination for Refusing to Rent to a Family Due to their Race, National Origin and Minor Children","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has charged the owners of a house in Beltrami County, Minnesota, and their real-estate agent, with discrimination for refusing to rent the house to a family because of race, national origin and their minor children. Read the charge.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to discriminate in housing because of the applicants' race, national origin and familial status (the presence of children under 18).
""Denying housing to a family because of their race and national origin and because they have children not only robs them of a place to call home, it violates this nation's housing laws,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Today's action reaffirms HUD's commitment to taking action to protect the right of families to obtain the housing of their choice, free from discrimination.""
""Housing discrimination because of familial status, race, or national origin has long been prohibited in this country,"" said Paul Compton, HUD's General Counsel. ""HUD will continue to vigorously enforce the Fair Housing Act to advocate for families with children, and other protected classes, who are treated unjustly in violation of the law.""
HUD's charge alleges that the owners refused to rent a 7,000 square foot, six-bedroom, house to a family of four adults and seven children because of their race (Native American) and national origin (Hispanic), and because the family has minor children. The charge further alleges that the owner and real-estate agent discouraged the family from renting the home by offering them less favorable rental terms, including increasing the rent by $1,000. After being denied the home, the family had to split up and live in separate residences.
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party elects for the case to be heard in federal court. If the administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages to the family for their losses as a result of the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties in order to vindicate the public interest.
April 2018 marked the 50th anniversary of the Fair Housing Act.

Read more about new residential construction activity (https://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/index.html).
NOTICE
With the April 2018 release, seasonally adjusted estimates of housing units authorized by building permits will be revised back to January 2012, and seasonally adjusted estimates of housing units authorized but not started, started, under construction, and completed will be revised back to January 2013. With each April release, seasonally adjusted data will now be revised for an additional five years beyond the revision period for unadjusted data. Research has shown that this revision span should produce more reliable seasonally adjusted time series.
EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take three months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, six months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2 percent) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percentage change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percentage changes are 90 percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percentage changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised 3 percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at the Census Bureau's website (https://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/how_the_data_are_collected/index.html).
* The 90 percent confidence interval includes zero. In such cases, there is insufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero."
08/17/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-085.cfm,HUD Files Housing Discrimination Complaint Against Facebook,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today a formal complaint against Facebook for violating the Fair Housing Act by allowing landlords and home sellers to use its advertising platform to engage in housing discrimination.
HUD claims Facebook enables advertisers to control which users receive housing-related ads based upon the recipient's race, color, religion, sex, familial status, national origin, disability, and/or zip code. Facebook then invites advertisers to express unlawful preferences by offering discriminatory options, allowing them to effectively limit housing options for these protected classes under the guise of 'targeted advertising.' Read HUD's complaint against Facebook.
""The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing discrimination including those who might limit or deny housing options with a click of a mouse,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""When Facebook uses the vast amount of personal data it collects to help advertisers to discriminate, it's the same as slamming the door in someone's face.""
The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in housing transactions including print and online advertisement on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, disability, or familial status. HUD's Secretary-initiated complaint follows the Department's investigation into Facebook's advertising platform which includes targeting tools that enable advertisers to filter prospective tenants or homebuyers based on these protected classes.
For example, HUD's complaint alleges Facebook's platform violates the Fair Housing Act. It enables advertisers to, among other things:
display housing ads either only to men or women; not show ads to Facebook users interested in an ""assistance dog,"" ""mobility scooter,"" ""accessibility"" or ""deaf culture""; not show ads to users whom Facebook categorizes as interested in ""child care"" or ""parenting,"" or show ads only to users with children above a specified age; to display/not display ads to users whom Facebook categorizes as interested in a particular place of worship, religion or tenet, such as the ""Christian Church,"" ""Sikhism,"" ""Hinduism,"" or the ""Bible."" not show ads to users whom Facebook categorizes as interested in ""Latin America,"" ""Canada,"" ""Southeast Asia,"" ""China,"" ""Honduras,"" or ""Somalia."" draw a red line around zip codes and then not display ads to Facebook users who live in specific zip codes.
• display housing ads either only to men or women;
• not show ads to Facebook users interested in an ""assistance dog,"" ""mobility scooter,"" ""accessibility"" or ""deaf culture"";
• not show ads to users whom Facebook categorizes as interested in ""child care"" or ""parenting,"" or show ads only to users with children above a specified age;
• to display/not display ads to users whom Facebook categorizes as interested in a particular place of worship, religion or tenet, such as the ""Christian Church,"" ""Sikhism,"" ""Hinduism,"" or the ""Bible.""
• not show ads to users whom Facebook categorizes as interested in ""Latin America,"" ""Canada,"" ""Southeast Asia,"" ""China,"" ""Honduras,"" or ""Somalia.""
• draw a red line around zip codes and then not display ads to Facebook users who live in specific zip codes.
Additionally, Facebook promotes its advertising targeting platform for housing purposes with ""success stories"" (https://www.facebook.com/business/success/quadrant-homes) for finding ""the perfect homeowners,"" ""reaching home buyers,"" ""attracting renters"" and ""personalizing property ads.""
In addition, today the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) filed a statement of interest, joined in by HUD, in U.S. District Court on behalf of a number of private litigants challenging Facebook's advertising platform.
HUD Secretary-Initiated Complaints
The Secretary of HUD may file a fair housing complaint directly against those whom the Department believes may be in violation of the Fair Housing Act. Secretary-Initiated Complaints are appropriate in cases, among others, involving significant issues that are national in scope or when the Department is made aware of potential violations of the Act and broad public interest relief is warranted or where HUD does not know of a specific aggrieved person or injured party that is willing or able to come forward. A Fair Housing Act complaint, including a Secretary initiated complaint, is not a determination of liability.
A Secretary-Initiated Complaint will result in a formal fact-finding investigation. The party against whom the complaint is filed will be provided notice and an opportunity to respond. If HUD's investigation results in a determination that reasonable cause exists that there has been a violation of the Fair Housing Act, a charge of discrimination may be filed. Throughout the process, HUD will seek conciliation and voluntary resolution. Charges may be resolved through settlement, through referral to the Department of Justice, or through an administrative determination.
This year marks the 50th anniversary of the Fair Housing Act.

08/20/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-081.cfm,HUD Charges Massachusetts Housing Providers with Discriminating Against Residents with Disabilities,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has charged Granby, Massachusetts property owner Pleasant Valley Estates, Inc., and its management company, Bernashe Realty, Inc., with housing discrimination for allegedly discriminating against persons with disabilities who require the use of assistance animals. Read HUD's charge.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from denying or limiting housing to persons with disabilities or from refusing to make reasonable accommodations in policies or practices. This includes waiving no pet policies for assistance or service animals.
""A person who requires the use of an assistance animal should not be unlawfully denied their right to have that reasonable accommodation,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Whenever the rights of persons with disabilities are violated, HUD will continue to take action to protect those rights.""
The case came to HUD's attention when the Massachusetts Fair Housing Center (MFHC), a HUD Fair Housing Initiatives Program agency, filed a complaint alleging that Pleasant Valley Estates, Inc., and Bernashe Realty, Inc., discriminate against persons with disabilities. The charge, issued on behalf of MFHC, alleges that the companies posted Craigslist advertisements which stated, ""One cat considered, no dogs please,"" and ""no service animals.""
The charge also describes testing that MFHC conducted. Two MFHC testers posing as persons with disabilities contacted Pleasant Valley Estates and asked if they could keep a dog to help with their disabilities. One of the testers was told by phone to send an email to arrange a visit to the property, but she received no reply to her email. The other tester received a reply stating, ""I am highly allergic to dogs and therefore I cannot accept dogs at my properties. I think I have that in my ad."" In contrast, MFHC testers who did not mention that they used assistance animals were offered opportunities to view units, told when units would become available, and given rental applications.
""Rules prohibiting service animals in housing violate the Fair Housing Act,"" said J. Paul Compton Jr., HUD's General Counsel. ""HUD is committed to ensuring that housing providers offer equal opportunities to prospective tenants with disabilities looking to rent a home.""
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he or she may award damages to the complainant for its losses because of the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties in order to vindicate the public interest. If the case is heard in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages to the complainant.

08/20/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-082.cfm,HUD Reaches Agreement with California Housing Providers Settling Claims of Disability Discrimination,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has reached a Conciliation/Voluntary Compliance Agreement with Christian Church Homes and Garfield Park Village, LP, in Oakland and Santa Cruz, California, resolving allegations that they discriminated against an applicant with disabilities when they rejected her request for modifications to a wheelchair accessible unit and bypassed her application for the unit, instead renting it to a family that had applied at a later date and had no member in need of the accessible features of the unit. Read the agreement.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to discriminate against persons with disabilities. In addition, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance, including providing modifications that are necessary for persons with disabilities.
""Requests for reasonable accommodations aren't requests for special treatment. They give persons with disabilities the opportunity to fully enjoy their homes,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Hopefully the settlement we're announcing today will help other housing providers to recognize and comply with their obligation to uphold the nation's housing laws.""
The case came to HUD's attention when a woman with a disability filed a complaint alleging that she had been denied the opportunity to rent one of two wheelchair accessible units at Garfield Park Village, using her Housing Choice Voucher. According to the complaint, the woman was first on the wait list for both units. She requested that she be allowed to further modify the unit to meet her needs. Her modification request, however, allegedly was denied and instead the unit was rented to a family that applied for the unit after her which had no members that needed the unit's accessible features.
Under the terms of the agreement, Christian Church Homes and Garfield Park Village, LP, will pay the woman $7,500 and allow her to remain on the wait list for another accessible unit. Christian Church Homes will also modify its policies and procedures to make it clear that the processing of an applicant's reasonable accommodation and/or modification request should not unreasonably delay a decision on tenancy or cause an applicant to be skipped over for an available unit in favor of an applicant who applied at a later date. In addition, Christian Church Homes will not rent an accessible unit to an applicant who does not need the unit's accessibility features when there is a pending application from an eligible qualified applicant with disabilities who requires the accessibility features.

08/20/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-086.cfm,HUD Launches Campaign to Boost Landlord Acceptance of Housing Vouchers,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson today announced a Department-wide task force as part of a larger campaign to encourage more landlords to participate in the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) Program. HUD's HCV Program is the nation's largest rental subsidy program assisting more than two million low-income households each year. However, two new studies find most landlords do not accept voucher-holders, and those who do complain about the program's administrative requirements and housing authorities which manage the program at the local level.
Consequently, Secretary Carson established HUD's new Landlord Task Force and announced a number of forums across the county to hear directly from landlords on ways to increase their participation in the HCV Program.
""These studies tell us that we have a lot of work to do to engage more landlords, so our Housing Choice Voucher Program can offer real choice to the families we serve,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""We will be traveling the country to hear directly from landlords about how we can make this critical program more user friendly.""
Next month, HUD will release a new study of landlord voucher acceptance in five cities: Philadelphia; Los Angeles; Fort Worth; Newark, New Jersey; and Washington, DC. The study, which was sponsored by HUD and conducted by the Urban Institute, is the first to use paired testing methods across multiple sites to examine landlord treatment of voucher recipients. While landlord participation varies across the five study sites, the researchers found voucher recipients are hard pressed to find a landlord who will accept their vouchers, especially in higher opportunity neighborhoods. In addition, landlords often 'stand up' testers posing as voucher recipients and even deny rental requests once testers reveal their source of income. Read a summary of HUD's and the Urban Institute's forthcoming Pilot Study of Landlord Acceptance in the Housing Choice Voucher Program (https://www.huduser.gov/portal/publications/pilot-study-landlord-acceptance-hcv-exec-summ.html).
Another study examined the role landlords and property managers play in housing low-income tenants, especially voucher recipients, in three urban rental markets—Baltimore, Cleveland, and Dallas. Prepared by Johns Hopkins University, the study examined how these local markets influence a landlord's decision whether or not to participate in the HCV Program. The researchers found that, while many landlords liked the program's reliable rent payments, the main reasons given for not participating in the HCV program were frustrations with required inspections and disappointment with how local housing authorities handle disputes with tenants. Read Urban Landlords and the Housing Choice Voucher Program (https://www.huduser.gov/portal/publications/UrbanLandlords.html).
To encourage more landlords and property managers to participate in the HCV Program, HUD's new Landlord Task Force will host a number of forums across the country to engage directly with housing providers, specifically those who do not participate in the voucher program. These listening forums are intended to reveal how HUD might make its primary rent subsidy program more accessible and acceptable, specifically in higher opportunity neighborhoods where landlord participation is lowest.
HUD will begin its landlord engagement campaign on September 20th in Washington, DC when it will present the findings of the two aforementioned studies. Individual landlord forums are planned in Philadelphia, Atlanta, Dallas, Los Angeles, Salt Lake City and Salem, Oregon. After completing these landlord forums, the Landlord Task Force will provide policy recommendations to the Secretary on programmatic changes to increase landlord participation in the HCV Program."

Read the charge.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to refuse to rent or to impose different rental terms on the basis of familial status, including actions that unreasonably limit rental occupancy by families with children.
""Occupancy policies that exclude families with children or make it harder for them to obtain housing are unlawful and have no place in today's often tight housing markets,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""We will continue to take action when housing providers employ practices that violate the nation's housing laws.""
""Housing discrimination because of familial status has long been prohibited in this country,"" said Paul Compton, HUD's General Counsel. ""HUD will continue to vigorously enforce the Fair Housing Act to advocate for families with children, and other protected classes, who are treated unjustly in violation of the law.""
HUD's charge alleges that the owners of The Village at Three Fountains refused to allow a couple living in a one-bedroom unit to remain in their home after they had a baby.
Shortly after the new baby arrived, the mother asked representatives of the property management company how long two adults could live in a one-bedroom unit with an infant and was told that since there were three occupying the apartment, they would have to move to a two-bedroom unit. Though the owners and property management company asserted that their two-person-per-bedroom occupancy policy was required by the Sioux Falls City occupancy code, HUD's charge alleges that the City Code is in fact more flexible than owners' policy, as it allows for the consideration of additional areas beyond bedrooms that may be considered for sleeping and occupancy purposes. After being denied the opportunity to remain in their unit, the couple and their baby moved to another complex.
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party elects for the case to be heard in federal court. If the administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages to the family for their losses as a result of the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties in order to vindicate the public interest.
April 2018 marked the 50th anniversary of the Fair Housing Act. In commemoration, HUD, local communities, housing advocates, and fair housing organizations across the country have coordinated a variety of activities to enhance awareness of fair housing rights, highlight HUD's fair housing enforcement efforts, and end housing discrimination in the nation.

EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take three months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, six months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2 percent) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percentage change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percentage changes are 90 percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percentage changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised 3 percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at the Census Bureau's website (https://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/how_the_data_are_collected/index.html).
* The 90 percent confidence interval includes zero. In such cases, there is insufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero."

The funding announced today is offered through HUD's Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS Program (HOPWA) (https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/hopwa/) and will renew HUD's support of 22 local programs. These grants provide a combination of housing assistance and supportive services for this vulnerable population.
""We recognize the profound effect stable housing can have on a person trying to manage their health,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""Working closely with our partners on the ground, these grants will provide critically needed housing and care for low-income persons living with HIV/AIDS.""
Research shows that a stable home is critical to the well-being of persons living with HIV/AIDS, and results in better health outcomes and reduced transmission of the disease. In addition to housing assistance, these local programs will provide access to supportive services such as case management, mental health services, substance abuse services, and employment training. The combination of housing assistance and supportive services are critical in sustaining housing stability, promoting better health outcomes, and increasing quality of life, which promotes self-sufficiency efforts for those able to transition to the private housing market.
Since 1992, HUD's HOPWA Program has provided national leadership and resources that support the development and operation of high-quality supportive housing programs. Under the HOPWA Program, HUD makes grants to cities, states, and nonprofit organizations to provide housing assistance and supportive services to low-income persons living with HIV/AIDS and their families. By providing assistance with housing and related services, the HOPWA program helps persons living with HIV/AIDS enter into housing, access and remain in medical care, and adhere to complex treatment regimens. More information on the HOPWA program is available at https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/hopwa/.

Campaign, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced a settlement with the former owners of a Newark, New Jersey apartment development for failing to provide decent, safe, and sanitary housing conditions to their residents. The agreement requires First King Properties LLC, and 117 South Fourth Street Realty, the former owners and managers of federally assisted Garden Spires Apartments, to pay $800,000 in civil penalties for not complying with the HUD Lead Disclosure Rule and Lead Safe Housing Rule. Read HUD's settlement agreement.
HUD previously issued notices to the owners and managers of Garden Spires Apartments, a 350-unit HUD-assisted housing complex in Newark, informing them that they failed to provide decent, safe, and sanitary housing and failed to comply with the Lead Safe Housing Rule and Lead Disclosure Rule. HUD alleged that the owners misrepresented their knowledge of lead-based paint and lead-based paint hazards within the project to tenants, and until October 2017, failed to conduct required risk assessment re-evaluations of those hazards and annual visual assessments. In addition, HUD claimed that the owners and managers knew that the project contained hazardous physical conditions.
""When taxpayers subsidize private housing, owners have a legal and moral obligation to provide decent and safe housing to the families we serve,"" said Lynne Patton, HUD's New York-New Jersey Regional Administrator. ""This settlement sends a clear message to all housing providers we do business with that HUD takes the health and safety of families seriously and there are stiff penalties to pay for those who fail to do so.""
HUD's Protect our Kids! Campaign is a Department-wide enforcement effort to make certain owners and landlords satisfy their obligations under the Lead Disclosure and Lead Safe Housing regulations. HUD's team is drawn from multiple enforcement and program offices at the Department, including HUD's Office of General Counsel (OGC); Departmental Enforcement Center (DEC); Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes (Healthy Homes); Office of the Inspector General (OIG); Office of Public and Indian Housing; Real Estate Assessment Center; and the Office of Multifamily Housing Programs. The objective of the campaign is to review and ensure compliance with regulations that are intended to reduce the potential of lead poisoning in children, in both privately owned homes and those receiving federal assistance.
Health Effects of Lead-Based Paint
No safe blood lead level in children has been identified. Lead exposure can affect nearly every system in the body. Lead exposure causes reduced IQ, learning disabilities, developmental delays, reduced height, poorer hearing, and a host of other health problems in young children. Many of these effects are thought to be irreversible. In later years, lead-poisoned children are much more likely to drop out of school, become juvenile delinquents and engage in criminal and other anti-social behavior. Researchers have found that even at low levels, lead exposure in children can significantly impact IQ and might delay puberty in young girls.
At higher levels, lead can damage a child's kidneys and central nervous system and cause anemia, coma, convulsions and even death. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 4 million households have children living in them that are being exposed to high levels of lead. There are approximately half a million U.S. children ages 1-5 with blood lead levels above 5 micrograms per deciliter, the reference level at which CDC recommends public health actions be initiated.
Eliminating lead-based paint hazards in older low-income housing is essential if childhood lead poisoning is to be eradicated. According to CDC estimates, the percentage of children with elevated blood lead levels has been cut in half since the early 1990's, although as many as 1 million children are still affected by lead poisoning today. About 23 million homes still have significant lead-based paint hazards, and, of them, about 3.6 million homes with children less than 6 years of age have significant lead-based paint hazards."

HUD's Choice Neighborhoods program promotes a comprehensive approach to transforming neighborhoods struggling to address the interconnected challenges of distressed housing, inadequate schools, poor health, high crime, and historic disinvestment. Choice Neighborhoods is focused on three core goals:
Housing: Replace distressed public and assisted housing with high-quality mixed-income housing that is well-managed and responsive to the needs of the surrounding neighborhood. People: Improve outcomes of households living in the target housing related to employment and income, health, and children's education; and Neighborhood: Create the conditions necessary for public and private reinvestment in distressed neighborhoods to offer the kinds of amenities and assets, including safety, good schools, and commercial activity, that are important to families' choices about their community.
• Housing: Replace distressed public and assisted housing with high-quality mixed-income housing that is well-managed and responsive to the needs of the surrounding neighborhood.

• Neighborhood: Create the conditions necessary for public and private reinvestment in distressed neighborhoods to offer the kinds of amenities and assets, including safety, good schools, and commercial activity, that are important to families' choices about their community.
Through Choice Neighborhoods Planning Grants, local governments, housing authorities, residents, nonprofits, tribal authorities, private developers, school districts, police departments, and other civic organizations create a common vision and develop effective strategies to revitalize their neighborhood. The resulting Transformation Plan lays the foundation for revitalizing the distressed public and/or assisted housing units, transforming the surrounding neighborhood, and promoting opportunities for families.
Three of the awardees will receive an additional $950,000 for ""Action Activities."" The City of Tucson, the Housing Authority of Baltimore City and Marquette University will use these additional funds to build momentum and attract additional investment. Eligible uses of these funds include recycling vacant property into community gardens, pocket parks, or farmers markets; beautification, place-making and community arts projects; homeowner and business façade improvement programs; neighborhood broadband or wi-fi; fresh food initiatives; and gap financing for economic development projects."

""Today's settlement reaffirms HUD's commitment to ensuring that housing providers are aware of their obligations under the nation's fair housing laws and take steps to comply with those obligations.""
The case came to HUD's attention when a woman with disabilities filed a complaint alleging that Jefferson School Apartments II, LLC, refused her request to be assigned a designated parking space close to her unit. Jefferson School Apartments and Housing Assistance Management Enterprise, a Salt Lake City-based non-profit corporation, receive federal financial assistance.
Under the terms of the agreement, Housing Assistance Management Enterprise and Jefferson School Apartment, LLC, will pay Complainant $18,000, transfer her to a ground-floor unit, pay moving expenses up to $2,500, and assign her a designated parking space in front of her unit. In addition, the owner and property management company will provide fair housing training for staff at the apartment complex, revise their reasonable accommodation policy, and revise their parking policy to include language that informs persons with disabilities about their right to request a designated parking space as a reasonable accommodation.

09/06/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-097.cfm,HUD and Census Bureau Release New American Housing Survey,"WASHINGTON - Renters are three times more likely to need financial assistance to evacuate during a major disaster than those who own their own homes. That's according to the new 2017 American Housing Survey released today by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the U.S. Census Bureau, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
The new survey finds that of the nearly 44 million American renter households, approximately 39 percent indicated they do not have access to $2,000 to cover evacuation expenses. Meanwhile, only 12 percent of 77.3 million owner households reported they did not have access to $2,000 to pay for their family's evacuation.
Each year, HUD and the Census Bureau produce the American Housing Survey (AHS), the most comprehensive analysis of the nation's housing inventory. The AHS covers a variety of ""core"" housing topics, including the composition and quality of the nation's housing inventory, mortgages and other housing costs, and neighborhood conditions.
For the second time in five years, HUD and FEMA teamed up to add questions related to households' disaster preparedness. The questions cover several aspects of disaster preparedness, including whether households need help evacuating pets—more than 13 million households said ""yes."" When households were asked to name their first source of emergency information during a disaster, a nearly equal number of households said ""television"" (37.9 million) and ""internet"" (37.4 million).
""For nearly 45 years, the American Housing Survey has been America's premier source of data on housing costs and quality,"" said HUD Deputy Secretary Pamela Hughes Patenaude. ""In collaboration with FEMA, we have added disaster preparedness questions to this survey to better understand the challenges that households face as they prepare for and respond to disasters.""
September is National Preparedness Month (https://www.ready.gov/september), an opportunity to remind Americans to prepare their families for when disaster strikes. This National Preparedness Month will focus on planning, with the central theme: Disasters Happen. Prepare Now. Learn How.
""We welcome our partnership with HUD and this new data from the American Housing Survey. This report underscores the need to prepare for the hazards we may face at any time,"" said FEMA's Deputy Administrator for Resilience, Dr. Daniel Kaniewski. ""During National Preparedness Month, FEMA is encouraging individuals, families, and communities to start preparing. People with an emergency plan in place, a little emergency savings in the bank, and the right insurance coverage will bounce back much quicker following a disaster.""
The 2017 American Housing Survey includes questions that allow researchers to track changes in key disaster preparedness measures compared to 2013. For example, approximately 4.4 million more households indicated they had an emergency evacuation kit in 2017 compared to 2013.
Other national findings among the 121.2 million occupied housing units surveyed include:
Disaster Preparedness
About 81.3 percent of households report they have enough non-perishable food for at least three days, although only 58.6 percent report they have at least three gallons or 24 bottles of water per person.

About 80.7 percent of all households reported they would have access to vital financial information in the event of a disaster. More than 77.3 million households indicated that if they were evacuated for two or more weeks, the most likely place they would stay would be with relatives or friends. About 27.9 million households said the most likely places they would stay is a hotel or motel.

09/06/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-099.cfm,HUD Awards Over $12 Million to Assist Tribal Communities with Making Housing Safer,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today awarded more than $12 million in Healthy Homes Production grants to 13 Tribes and Tribal agencies to protect children and families from home health and safety hazards (see chart below).
The grant funding announced today will assist and protect families by targeting health hazards in 1,300 low-income homes with significant home health and safety hazards. The Healthy Homes Production grant program has a demonstrated history of success, filling critical needs in communities where no other resources exist to address substandard housing that threatens the health of the most vulnerable residents.
""Protecting families and their children from safety hazards is a huge investment in the health of those who live in Native American communities,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""These grants announced today shows HUD's commitment to collaborate with tribal communities to ensure that their housing is healthy and safe.""
""Millions of families and children are seeing their hope for the future threatened by poor health simply because of where they live,"" noted Matt Ammon, Director of HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes. ""This round of funding includes awards to 13 Tribes and Tribal housing agencies that are receiving grant awards for the first time. We are pleased the program is expanding into these previously unserved communities.""
Unsafe and unhealthy homes affect the health of millions of people of all income levels, geographic areas, and walks of life in the U.S. These homes affect the economy directly, through increased utilization of health care services, and indirectly through lost wages and increased school days missed. Housing improvements help prevent injuries and illnesses, reduce associated health care and social services costs, reduce absentee rates for children in school and adults at work, and reduce stress, all which help to improve the quality of life.
HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes promotes local efforts to eliminate dangerous lead paint and other housing-related health hazards from lower income homes; stimulate private sector investment in lead hazard control; supports cutting-edge research on methods for assessing and controlling housing-related health and safety hazards; and educates the public about the dangers of hazards in the home.

09/07/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-100.cfm,HUD Reaches Agreement with Nevada Landlords Settling Claims of Sexual Harassment,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has approved a Conciliation Agreement between Reno, Nevada-based CMS Property Services, LLC, and its property manager and a female tenant, resolving allegations that the manager sexually harassed the woman. CMS owns and/or manages close to 80 units in the Reno-Sparks area. Read the agreement.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful for a housing provider and its staff to sexually harass tenants. This includes creating a severe or pervasive hostile housing environment, or conditioning housing or housing-related services on the tenant's acquiescence to sexual demands. The Act also prohibits retaliating against persons who complain about housing discrimination.
""Never should anyone trying to provide a home for their family have to endure sexual harassment and lewd behavior in order to remain in that home,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD remains firmly committed to addressing this type of treatment and taking action against those who violate this nation's housing laws.""
The case came to HUD's attention when a single mother of six filed a complaint alleging that the manager of her building sexually harassed her and created a hostile living environment, including unwanted touching and sexual comments. In addition, the woman alleged that CMS attempted to terminate her tenancy and failed to return a rent overpayment of $1,000 because she was unreceptive to the manager's advances.
Under the terms of the agreement, CMS Property Services, LLC, and the property manager will pay the woman $7,000, and the property manager and another staff member will attend fair housing training. CMS and the property manager will also modify their leases and applications to include a statement notifying applicants and tenants that they do not discriminate on the basis of race, national origin, color, disability, sex, religion or familial status.
In July, HUD and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) released a public service announcement (PSA) to raise awareness of housing-related sexual harassment and to reach persons who are victimized by it. The goal of this campaign is to make it easier for victims all over the country to find resources and report harassment. Watch the public service announcement (PSA) (https://youtu.be/-R3Q8ewWJas). HUD and DOJ are also providing training and best practice materials on preventing and addressing sexual and other discriminatory harassment in housing to public housing staff, private landlords who accept housing vouchers, and residents of public housing and voucher housing.
April 2018 marked the 50th anniversary of the Fair Housing Act. In commemoration, HUD, local communities, housing advocates, and fair housing organizations across the country have coordinated a variety of activities to enhance awareness of fair housing rights, highlight HUD's fair housing enforcement efforts, and end housing discrimination in the nation.

09/11/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-101.cfm,"HUD Charges Florida Company, Couple with Discriminating Against Hispanic Homeowners","WASHINGTON - The radio and television commercials seemed too good to be true; promising Hispanic homeowners to cut their mortgage payments in half, even offering $500 gift cards to entice them to sign up for loan modification assistance. But it was too good to be true, and today the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is charging a Florida company and its owners with housing discrimination for intentionally targeting Hispanic homeowners in a predatory mortgage modification scheme that increased, rather than decreased, their risk of foreclosure. Read HUD's charge.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination because of national origin in housing and housing related services, including home mortgage and loan modification services. This includes targeting persons because of their national origin for fraudulent modification services.
HUD claims that Advocate Law Groups of Florida, P.A., Jon B. Lindeman, Jr., and Ephigenia K. Lindeman violated the Fair Housing Act by intentionally targeting Hispanic families through a deceptive advertising campaign that aired on Spanish-language radio and television stations throughout Florida.
""As we peeled back the facts of this case, we were stunned by a business model built to target Hispanic homeowners,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will use the full weight of the law to protect families from those who would prey upon them because of where they come from or what language they speak.""
HUD's charge, filed on behalf of three Orlando-area Hispanic families, alleges that at initial client meetings, Spanish-speaking ALG employees made false promises to entice families into paying significant upfront fees and to sign contracts that were predominantly, if not entirely, written in English. After being retained, ALG knowingly placed their clients' homes at imminent risk of foreclosure by instructing homeowners to stop making mortgage payments and to cease communicating with their mortgage lenders or servicers.
In addition, HUD's charge alleges that ALG neglected their clients' cases and ignored bank requests for information. When homeowners complained about their mistreatment, ALG threatened them with increased mortgage payments, fines, or foreclosure if they sought to terminate their relationship. ALG ultimately failed to obtain favorable mortgage modifications for their clients, while charging them thousands of dollars in up-front and recurring monthly fees.
""Intentionally targeting families with predatory mortgage services because of their national origin is a clear violation of the Fair Housing Act,"" said Paul Compton, HUD's General Counsel. ""This charge sends a clear message that HUD will protect the housing rights of all persons to the fullest extent of the law.""
This year marks the 50th anniversary of the passage of the Fair Housing Act, and the 30th anniversary of amendments to the Act prohibiting discrimination against persons with disabilities and families with children. This year, HUD, local communities, housing advocates, and fair housing organizations across the country are conducting a variety of activities to enhance awareness of fair housing rights, highlight HUD's fair housing enforcement efforts, and end housing discrimination in the nation.

09/14/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-102.cfm,HUD Charges New Orleans Landlord with Discriminating Against Families with Children,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is charging a New Orleans landlord with housing discrimination for publishing an advertisement that discriminated against families with children. The ad, which was brought to HUD's attention by the Greater New Orleans Fair Housing Action Center, included language that stated, ""No Teenagers Please."" Read HUD's charge.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to deny or limit housing because a family has children under the age of 18 and to make statements that discriminate against families with children. This includes publishing print, broadcast or internet advertisements that indicate a preference or otherwise discriminate against families with children. Housing may exclude children only if it meets the Fair Housing Act's exemption for housing for older persons.
""Landlords do not have the right to deny a family a place to live just because they have children,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Today's enforcement action reaffirms HUD's commitment to ensuring that housing providers meet their obligation to treat all applicants for housing the same, including families with children.""
""Discrimination against families with children - no matter the age - violates the law and limits the housing opportunities of those families,"" said J. Paul Compton, HUD's General Counsel. ""HUD will continue to take action to protect the rights of families.""
The case came to HUD's attention when the Greater New Orleans Fair Housing Action Center, a HUD Fair Housing Initiatives Program agency, filed a complaint based on fair housing tests it conducted after seeing an ad on Craigslist that prohibited teenagers. When testers contacted the owner to inquire about the unit, the owner said, ""I don't want any children. I don't want teenaged children.""
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages to the complainant for harm caused by the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose fines to vindicate the public interest. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages.

09/19/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-103.cfm,"HUD Rental Assistance Demonstration Reaches Historic 100,000 Unit Milestone","AUSTIN, TX - U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson today announced that 100,000 units of affordable public housing have been preserved through the Department's Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD), an innovative approach to confronting the dwindling and aging supply of public housing. In a groundbreaking ceremony today in Austin, Texas, Secretary Carson and HUD's Assistant Secretary for Housing and Federal Housing Administration (FHA) Commissioner Brian Montgomery joined city leaders and the Housing Authority of the City of Austin to mark this important milestone.
RAD allows public housing authorities (PHAs) to access private investment through public-private partnerships to help preserve public housing properties and address the growing nationwide backlog of deferred maintenance, estimated by HUD to be at $35 billion. Each year, roughly 10,000 units of public housing are lost due to disrepair. Without RAD, it would have taken 46 years for housing authorities to complete the same level of unit repairs and renewals.
""This program proves we can protect and preserve critically needed affordable housing by tapping into the power of capital markets,"" said Secretary Carson. ""Today we reached an important milestone, but this is just the beginning. We hope to transform hundreds of thousands of units into affordable housing that families are proud to call home.""
""The RAD program is a win-win. It preserves affordable housing for the people who need it most and transforms aging public housing into safer places to live-all without increasing costs for taxpayers,"" said Commissioner Montgomery.
In the five years of the program's existence:
Roughly 210,000 individuals and/or families have a better place to call home. Approximately $5.75 billion in capital investment has been made to make repairs and improvements to affordable rental housing stock. 100,000 former public housing units have converted to Section 8 platform units with new long-term contracts ensuring these units remain affordable to low-income households. Lead and other environmental hazards have been addressed to ensure residents live in healthy homes. An estimated 108,000+ jobs have been generated, often employing low-income residents through HUD's Section 3 hiring initiatives.
• Roughly 210,000 individuals and/or families have a better place to call home.

• Lead and other environmental hazards have been addressed to ensure residents live in healthy homes.
• An estimated 108,000+ jobs have been generated, often employing low-income residents through HUD's Section 3 hiring initiatives.
Under RAD, public housing authorities convert some or all of their developments to a project-based Section 8 platform. This conversion allows PHAs to identify creative ways to solve their capital needs through public-private partnerships and with no new federal funding. The new, long-term Section 8 contracts guarantee that the units remain permanently affordable to low-income households. RAD has proved to be a powerful tool for PHAs to preserve affordable housing to serve more eligible households and to maximize the impact of the existing commitment of federal resources. While most conversions involve the modernization and stabilization of existing properties, many PHAs have demolished severely distressed properties and replaced them with new, permanently affordable housing. PHAs are also using RAD to help families move from blighted or isolated locations to neighborhoods of greater opportunity where they will have better access to jobs, transportation and good schools for their children.
In response to high demand from housing authorities to utilize RAD, Congress increased the program cap from 225,000 units to 455,000 units. This will allow additional eligible public housing properties to be preserved and improved through RAD. In the FY 2019 President's Budget, the Administration has requested to eliminate the statutory cap on public housing properties that could convert to long-term Section 8 rental assistance.

""We are grateful for the great working relationship we have established with the Department of Housing and Urban Development and for their continuous consideration in terms of the housing, infrastructure, and economic revitalization needs of the American citizens living in Puerto Rico,"" said Governor Ricardo Rosselló. ""The Island continues to recover from the passage of hurricanes Irma and Maria, but with the trust and support of HUD we will definitely rebuild better and stronger than ever. The People of Puerto Rico thank Secretary Ben Carson and Deputy Secretary Pam Patenaude for their committed attention to the recovery of the Island.""

Background
On September 8, 2017, President Trump signed the Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements Act, 2017 (https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/601/text). The Act appropriated $7.4 billion in CDBG-DR funding for major disasters declared in 2017. To distribute these funds, the Act requires HUD to direct the funds to the areas most impacted by last year's major disasters. On February 1, 2018, HUD allocated $1.5 billion of that appropriation to Puerto Rico to address the serious unmet needs on the island. The action plan approved today will put these funds to work.
On April 10, 2018, HUD allocated another $18.5 billion to further support recovery in Puerto Rico and to rebuild communities impacted by Hurricanes Maria and Irma and to protect them from major disasters in the future. HUD will shortly publish program rules to guide Puerto Rico and others on the use of those funds.
CDBG-DR grants support a variety of disaster recovery activities including housing redevelopment and rebuilding, business assistance, economic revitalization, and infrastructure repair. Grantees are required to spend the majority of these recovery funds in ""most impacted"" areas as identified by HUD. HUD will issue administrative guidelines shortly for use of the funds to address grantees' long-term recovery needs, particularly in the area of housing recovery."

The three alleged that the lender refused to refinance their homes because they are on Native American lands. The individual also claimed that loanDepot.com would not refinance his house because he is Native American. Read the agreement.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing discrimination in mortgage lending and real estate-related transactions based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status and disability.
""A homeowner's creditworthiness and ability to pay should be the only thing that matters when they apply for a mortgage, not their race or the fact that their home is located on Native American lands,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Today's agreement sends a loud and clear message that HUD is committed to ensuring that lenders and other companies involved in the home mortgage process meet their obligations under the Fair Housing Act.""
The cases came to HUD's attention when the couple from Belcourt, North Dakota, and the homeowner from Hoopa, California, filed complaints alleging that loanDepot,com refused to refinance their homes, which they owned in fee simple but within American Indian reservations. In one case, Appraisal Management Services of America informed loanDepot.com that it could not provide an appraisal on the home because it was on ""Indian land."" LoanDepot.com and Appraisal Management Services of America deny discriminating against the three homeowners.
Under the terms of the agreement, loanDepot.com will pay the couple and the other homeowner $30,000 each and fund a loan subsidy program in the amount of $40,000 that will benefit prospective borrowers on American Indian Reservations. LoanDepot.com also will provide $240,000 to support outreach programs that improve housing conditions, teach financial literacy, and provide home ownership education to American Indians on and around reservations. In addition, loanDepot.com will revise its policies regarding the underwriting of home mortgage loans on land located within the boundaries of American Indian reservations to ensure that its policies are consistent with the requirements of the Fair Housing Act.
Appraisal Management Services of America, Inc., will revise its policies regarding appraisals for mortgages on homes located on American Indian reservations and no longer contract with appraisers who refuse to conduct appraisals on reservations.

The purpose of the CoE initiative is to accelerate the modernization of information technology (IT) across the federal government by leveraging private sector innovation and existing government services while centralizing best practices and expertise. By bringing the CoE model to HUD, GSA will utilize the expertise of the Technology Transformation Services (TTS) team within GSA's Federal Acquisition Service (FAS) to begin a comprehensive assessment of the IT needs and challenges facing the department.
""I'm thrilled HUD is teaming up with GSA to transform this agency into a more effective and efficient servant on behalf of the American people,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""This is an important moment for HUD as we embark upon a campaign to modernize our aging technology and bring true financial integrity to everything we do.""
""Secretary Carson and his team are committed to utilizing the Centers of Excellence approach - and GSA's expertise - to make interactions with the American people more seamless and effective,"" said GSA Administrator Emily Murphy. ""Today's announcement further demonstrates the strength, success, and momentum that the CoEs have already brought to bear in less than a year. I couldn't be more excited to build upon the work we have begun with USDA by implementing these best practices at an agency as customer-focused and citizen-facing as HUD.""
""Applying these successful business management principles to our operations and modernizing our technology infrastructure will transform this agency,"" said HUD Chief Operating Officer Ralph Gaines. ""We thank GSA for launching this important initiative and partnering with HUD to make our federal government more accountable to taxpayers.""
""With GSA's help we will transform how HUD operates across our agency and within our programs,"" said HUD Chief Financial Officer Irv Dennis. ""This first phase will help us identify the upgrades we need to bring our technology systems and accounting procedures into the 21st century. Overall, this is a great initiative we see often in the private sector and not often enough in the federal government.""
""In partnering with GSA's CoEs, HUD's business needs are our primary focus,"" said HUD Chief Information Officer David Chow. ""This first phase of the CoEs will be led by program office experts with full IT support to streamline business processes and enhance taxpayers' overall experience.""
HUD's mission is to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all. Through the CoE initiative, HUD will examine its technology infrastructure and operating procedures to identify needed upgrades and opportunities for improvement. These changes will help the agency in its goal to strengthen the housing market for people at every income level and to improve quality of life for current and future HUD program participants.
The CoE initiative was formally introduced through a Request for Information (https://www.fbo.gov/index.php?s=opportunity&mode=form&id= cca9da77bffbcb0d0a8f1b46d4cfa4ad&tab=core&tabmode=list&=) (RFI) issued on October 20, 2017. Beginning with the first lighthouse agency, United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), each CoE tackles distinct tasks, beginning with an assessment and planning phase that results in the development of a roadmap for the successful implementation of managing centralized, function-specific talent, solutions, and acquisition vehicles. They also provide for documented and scalable best-practices that can be rapidly spread to, and adopted by, other agencies throughout the government.
Following an industry day at the White House in December 2017, GSA moved quickly to finalize an Interagency Agreement with USDA and later issued solicitations for its Phase I strategy and consulting work.

EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take three months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, six months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2 percent) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percentage change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percentage changes are 90 percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percentage changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised 3 percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at the Census Bureau's website (https://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/how_the_data_are_collected/index.html).
* The 90 percent confidence interval includes zero. In such cases, there is insufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero."
09/27/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-110.cfm,HUD and U.S. Virgin Islands Sign $243 Million Disaster Recovery Grant Agreement,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Deputy Secretary Pamela Hughes Patenaude and the U.S. Virgin Island's Governor Kenneth Mapp today announced the formal execution of a $243 million grant agreement to help citizens in the U.S. Virgin Islands to recover from Hurricanes Irma and Maria. The signing of this grant agreement now paves the way to speed recovery dollars needed to restore damaged and destroyed homes, businesses and infrastructure.
The U.S. Virgin Islands' long-term recovery is supported through HUD's Community Development Block Grant-Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) Program, which requires grantees to develop thoughtful recovery plans informed by local residents. Learn more about CDBG-DR and the State's role in long-term disaster recovery (https://youtu.be/Lrmwz8IXXdQ).
""Today, we take another important step in the process of rebuilding damaged homes, restoring shuttered businesses and repairing critical infrastructure,"" said Deputy Secretary Patenaude. ""With the formal execution of this grant agreement, the real brick-and-mortar recovery work can begin.""
""On behalf of the people of the Virgin Islands, I thank Secretary Carson, Deputy Secretary Patenaude and all the HUD staff for working so closely with us to finalize this grant,"" Governor Kenneth Mapp said. ""We look forward to be being able to speed up assistance to homeowners and to construct new housing for seniors and others in need. We now have the opportunity to make permanent repairs to public housing and provide assistance to private landlords as we work to rebuild our housing stock. HUD is also helping us ensure that more Virgin Islanders have the opportunity to be a part of the rebuilding process through funding training for work in the construction trades.""
To address unmet needs, the U.S. Virgin Islands identified several housing, infrastructure and economic development recovery needs arising from Hurricanes Irma and Maria. The U.S. Virgin Islands disaster recovery action plan includes the following activities:
Homeowner Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Program ($10 million) - This program is available to eligible homeowners for properties that were damaged by Hurricanes Irma or Maria.
New Construction for Homeownership Opportunity and First Time Homebuyer Assistance ($10 million) - This program is designed to address post-disaster housing affordability challenges and enable renters to become homeowners.
Rental Rehabilitation and Reconstruction ($5 million) - This program provides funds for the repair or replacement of damage to rental housing owned by the Virgin Islands Housing Authority, Virgin Islands Housing Finance Agency, and private landlords.
Public & Affordable Housing Development ($32 million) - These funds are targeted for the redevelopment and creation of new affordable housing, including subsidized and mixed-income rental units.
Supportive Housing & Sheltering Programs ($15 million) - The U.S. Virgin Islands recovery plan includes an effort for the rehabilitation, reconstruction, and development of housing for vulnerable populations, particularly among low-income seniors and those persons and families experiencing homelessness. This program also includes the development of emergency shelters for individuals and families who cannot shelter in place during disasters. The emergency shelter housing would also serve persons who require short-term housing because they are temporarily displaced.
Infrastructure ($125,549,800) - These funds are targeted for three infrastructure activities: 1) Local Match for Federal Disaster Relief Programs ($50,549,800) to help finance educational facilities, energy, hospitals, telecommunications, transportation, waste management, and water/wastewater management; 2) Infrastructure Repair and Resilience ($30,000,000) and 3) Electrical Power Systems Enhancement and Improvement ($45,000,000).
Economic Revitalization ($33 million) - Through this program, the U.S. Virgin Islands seeks to revitalize the post-disaster economy, including ($23 million) for Ports and Airports Enhancements, including harbor dredging to allow for larger cruise ships; 2) a Workforce Development Program to train low- and moderate-income residents to fill the construction and other jobs coming from recovery investments ($5,000,000); and 3) the Tourism Industry Support Program ($5,000,000), which will require a waiver by HUD, for marketing to communicate that the USVI is open for business.
Background
On September 8, 2017, President Trump signed the Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements Act, 2017. The Act appropriated $7.4 billion in CDBG-DR funding for major disasters declared in 2017. To distribute these funds, the Act requires HUD to direct the funds to the areas most impacted by last year's major disasters. On February 2, 2018, HUD allocated $243 million of that appropriation to the U.S. Virgin Islands to address the serious unmet needs on the islands. The action plan approved today will put these funds to work.
On April 10, 2018, HUD allocated another $1.6 billion to further support recovery in the U.S. Virgin Islands and to rebuild communities impacted by Hurricanes Maria and Irma and to protect them from major disasters in the future. HUD will shortly publish program rules to guide the U.S. Virgin Islands and others on the use of those funds.
CDBG-DR grants support a variety of disaster recovery activities including housing redevelopment and rebuilding, business assistance, economic revitalization, and infrastructure repair. Grantees are required to spend the majority of these recovery funds in ""most impacted"" areas as identified by HUD. HUD will issue administrative guidelines shortly for use of the funds to address grantees' long-term recovery needs, particularly in the area of housing recovery."
09/28/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-111.cfm,FHA to Require Second Appraisal for Certain Reverse Mortgages,"WASHINGTON - The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) today announced that it will begin requiring lenders originating new Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECMs), commonly referred to as reverse mortgages, to provide a second property appraisal under certain circumstances. FHA is instructing lenders to provide a second independent property appraisal in cases where FHA determines there may be inflated property valuations.
FHA's new requirement takes effect for case numbers assigned on or after October 1, 2018 through September 30, 2019. FHA will periodically review this guidance and, based on the results, may renew these requirements beyond fiscal year 2019. Read FHA's Mortgagee Letter.
FHA will perform a risk assessment of appraisals submitted for use in new HECM originations. Based on the outcome of that assessment, FHA may require a second appraisal be obtained prior to approving the reverse mortgage for an insurance endorsement. Under the new policy, lenders must not approve or close a HECM before FHA has performed the collateral risk assessment and, if required, a second appraisal is obtained. Where a second appraisal is required by FHA, lenders must use the lower value of the two appraisals.
The appraisal validation policy announced today will further reduce risks to FHA's Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMIF) and protect the health of the HECM program. The financial soundness of FHA's reverse mortgage program is contingent on an accurate determination of a property's value and condition. The property value is used to determine the amount of equity that is available to the borrower and it is also used by FHA to determine the amount of insurance benefits paid to a mortgagee.
In a 2017 evaluation, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) found higher-than-expected losses in the HECM program could be attributed in part to ""optimistic estimates of collateral value driven by exaggerated property appraisals when the loan was originated."" Read Reverse Mortgage Collateral: Undermaintenance or Overappraisal? (https://www.huduser.gov/portal/periodicals/cityscpe/vol19num1/ch1.pdf).
FHA is addressing the accuracy of appraised property values due to continuing volatility in the HECM program. Last year, FHA's Fiscal Year 2018 Annual Report to Congress found the agency's reverse mortgage portfolio had a negative capital ratio of 19.84 percent and a negative net worth of $14.5 billion. To begin to address the financial solvency of the program, FHA instituted several reforms to the HECM program to improve its financial health and to ensure reverse mortgages remain a resource to allow senior borrowers to remain in their homes and age in place. FHA is continuing to analyze the impact of these reforms and expects to provide an assessment in its Annual Report on the financial status of the MMIF."
10/02/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-112.cfm,HUD Awards $6.7 Million in Research Grants to Reduce Lead and Other Housing-Related Health Hazards,"WASHINGTON - To help protect children and seniors from exposure to lead and other home health hazards, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today awarded $6.7 million to seven universities and public health organizations to improve methods for identifying and controlling residential health risks including lead-based paint, mold, secondhand tobacco smoke, and other indoor contaminants. Read a complete project-by-project summary of the programs awarded grants today.
The grants to states and local governments, institutions of higher education are being offered through HUD's Lead and Healthy Homes Technical Studies Grant Program. The following is a state-by-state breakdown of the grant awards announced today:
""This research will help communities create healthier home environments for families and seniors,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""These grants not only save money but also help to prevent injuries from lead-based paint exposure and common housing-related health hazards.""
""It's critical that we continue supporting research to develop evidence-based methods that make our homes safer places to live,"" said Matt Ammon, Director of HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes. ""We know that poor quality housing can contribute to injury and illness, which is entirely preventable.""
HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes promotes local efforts to eliminate dangerous lead-paint and other housing-related health and safety hazards from lower income homes, stimulate private sector investment in lead hazard control, support cutting-edge research on methods for assessing and controlling housing-related health and safety hazards, and educate the public about the dangers of hazards in the home."
10/03/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-113.cfm,HUD and VA Secretaries Announce Housing Initiatives to Support Homeless Veterans,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Secretary Robert Wilkie today joined together at the VA Community Resource and Referral Center to announce $35 million in grants to combat veteran homelessness. The funding will be provided through the HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) Program to 212 public housing agencies across the country to provide a permanent home for over 4,000 homeless veterans.
The Secretaries also announced an additional $7.4 million through the Veterans Housing Rehabilitation and Modification Pilot (VHRMP) Program to assist disabled veterans with modifying or rehabilitating their homes, making them more accessible.
""We have few responsibilities greater than making sure those who have sacrificed so much in service to their country have a home they can call their own,"" said HUD Secretary Carson. ""The housing vouchers awarded today ensure homeless veterans nationwide have access to affordable housing and the critical support services from the VA.""
""Assisting homeless Veterans to gain access to housing helps them in every aspect of their lives,"" said VA Secretary Wilkie. ""This joint effort ensures that the federal government's efforts are aligned in reducing homelessness and aiding veterans. VA and HUD are proud to be teammates in a program that makes a tangible improvement in the lives of the nation's Veterans.""
The HUD-VASH program combines rental assistance vouchers from HUD with case management and clinical services provided by VA. Since 2008, more than 93,000 vouchers have been awarded and approximately 150,000 homeless veterans have been served through the HUD-VASH program. More than 600 public housing authorities (PHAs) administer the HUD-VASH program, and this most recent award includes 22 additional PHAs, increasing HUD-VASH coverage to more communities. See the local impact of the housing assistance announced today.
In the HUD-VASH program, VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) assess veterans experiencing homelessness before referring them to local housing agencies for these vouchers. Decisions are based on a variety of factors, most importantly the duration of homelessness and the need for long-term, intensive support in obtaining and maintaining permanent housing. The HUD-VASH program includes both the rental assistance the voucher provides and the comprehensive case management that VAMC staff offers.
Veterans participating in the HUD-VASH program rent privately owned housing and generally contribute no more than 30 percent of their income toward rent. VA offers eligible homeless veterans clinical and supportive services through its medical centers across the U.S., Guam, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Read more about the HUD-VASH program.
Through the VHRMP program, grantees will make necessary physical modifications to address the adaptive housing needs of eligible veterans, including wheelchair ramps, widening exterior and interior doors, reconfiguring and reequipping bathrooms, or adding a bedroom or bathroom for the veteran's caregiver to the home.
The purpose of this pilot program is to assist our nation's low-income veterans living with disabilities who are in need of adaptive housing to help them regain or maintain their independence. By partnering with the VA, HUD is addressing these challenges by awarding competitive grants to organizations that primarily serve veterans and low-income people.

10/04/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-114.cfm,HUD Charges Texas Landlord and Property Manager with Discriminating Against Families with Children,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced it is charging a McAllen, Texas property owner and management company with discriminating against families with children. HUD alleges the owners of El Patrimonio Apartments and its management company, Texas Regional Asset Management, LLC, threatened to fine a family $250 because their two children played in the community area of the complex. Read HUD's Charge.
The Fair Housing Act expressly prohibits housing discrimination on the basis of familial status, including setting restrictive terms and conditions on tenants with children under 18.
""Families shouldn't be penalized for letting their kids be kids,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Imposing different rules and restrictions on families because they have children is a violation of the Fair Housing Act and HUD is committed to ensuring that housing providers meet their obligations under the law.""
HUD's charge alleges that the owners of El Patrimonio Apartments enacted a policy that required children under the age of 18 to be supervised by an adult family member while on the property, including the pool area, with violations of the policy resulting in a $250 fine. In one instance, a couple was threatened with a fine because their two children were playing in the community area while being supervised by adults who were not blood relatives.
""Discrimination against families with children violates the law and limits the ability of children to be children,"" said J. Paul Compton, HUD's General Counsel. ""HUD will continue to take action to protect the rights of families.""
The case will be heard in federal district court. If it is determined that illegal discrimination occurred, a judge may award actual and punitive damages, order injunctive, or other equitable relief to deter further discrimination, and order that defendants pay the couple's attorney fees.
Last April, HUD marked the 50th anniversary of the Fair Housing Act, joining local communities, housing advocates, and fair housing organizations across the country in a coordinated campaign to enhance awareness of fair housing rights. Persons who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY)."
10/04/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-115.cfm,Historic Chicago Apartment Development Earns 2018 HUD Secretary Award,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) today announced Chicago's Rosenwald Courts Apartments, once home to boxer Joe Louis, and Olympian Jesse Owens, as the recipient of the 2018 ACHP/HUD Secretary's Award for Excellence in Historic Preservation (https://www.huduser.gov/portal/about/HistoricPres-intro.html).
This annual award recognizes developers, organizations, and agencies for successfully advancing historic preservation, while providing affordable housing and/or expanded economic opportunities for low- and moderate-income families and individuals.
The rehabilitation of the 1920's-era housing project retains many historic features of the original development while modernizing the space to include 239 one- and two- bedroom apartments, 40,000-square-feet of office space, and 16,000-square-feet of retail stores. The restoration conducted by Rosenwald Apartments, LP, which includes Iceberg Development, Evercore Companies, RCAP LP, Lightengale Group, and Roos Enterprises, is an activity center of Chicago's Bronzeville neighborhood.
""This is a wonderful example of how we can preserve affordable housing and our history at the same time,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""This housing development has deep roots on Chicago's South Side and will continue to be a vital presence in the Bronzeville neighborhood for generations to come.""
""Against all odds, repeatedly avoiding the wrecking ball, the historic Rosenwald Courts Apartments has been rehabilitated and put back into use as a vital community anchor,"" said ACHP Chairman Milford Wayne Donaldson, FAIA. ""The project utilized HUD and City funding along with Historic Tax Credits to ensure the entirety of the apartment complex was renovated, preserving the historic aspects of the buildings and grounds, and providing an affordable place for people to live.""
The complex was originally developed in 1929 by Sears & Roebuck founder Julius Rosenwald with 454 units and provided much-needed quality housing for African-American families in Chicago during a time of segregation and limited housing options.
There was a long road to the re-opening of the former Michigan Boulevard Garden Apartments. Rosenwald Courts sat vacant for many years and was saved repeatedly from demolition. In 2002, Rosenwald was included on Landmarks Illinois' Most Endangered Historic Places in Illinois list; in 2003, the National Trust for Historic Places America's 11 Most Endangered Historic Places list; and in 2007, Preservation Chicago's list of the Chicago 7 Most Endangered Buildings.
Additionally, there were many failed attempts at rehabilitation but through persistent support from community leaders, local residents, preservationists, and HUD the purchase of Rosenwald Apartments came to fruition.
The $132 million financing package utilized two HUD funding sources: Neighborhood Stabilization Funds and Public Housing Capital Funds. The $8.5 million in NSP funds were used to acquire and rehabilitate the building and the Public Housing Capital Funds provided $17 million to return 60 public housing units to the neighborhood.
These funding sources accounted for almost 20 percent of the total development costs of the project. Through its HUD funding, the Chicago Housing Authority supported the 120 senior units at the property. Other integral financing came through $25 million in Tax Increment Financing (TIF) funds from the City of Chicago and $21 million in federal historic tax credits.
The significant exterior repairs retained many historic qualities - the main building's terra-cotta portals that connect the courtyard to the street, installation of more than 2,500 new windows matching the historic windows, and restoration of the historic 47th Street storefronts. The historic axial pathways in the courtyard were retained and augmented with new plantings, benches, grills, bike racks, and dog runs. A new seating area was added at the south end of the courtyard to serve both residents and retail patrons.
When Rosenwald reopened in fall of 2016, it provided much-needed affordable housing and new retail and office spaces. The rehabilitation created 360 construction jobs and 40 permanent jobs for local residents."
10/10/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-116.cfm,HUD Awards $47 Million in Housing Counseling Grants,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today awarded $47 million in housing counseling grants to help approximately 1 million households find housing, make more informed housing choices, or keep their current homes. See list of all counseling agencies awarded funding today.
""HUD-approved housing counselors are on the front lines, guiding people through their first home purchase and the ups and downs of homeownership,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""Their efforts give families a real opportunity to realize their dream of owning a home is obtainable by offering advice on affordable rental housing, home financing, and tools to prevent foreclosure.""
These grants will directly support the housing counseling services provided by 31 national and regional organizations, six multi-state organizations, 19 State Housing Finance Agencies (SHFAs) and 207 local housing counseling agencies. In addition, HUD is awarding $3.5 million to four national organizations to train and certify additional housing counselors.
National and regional agencies distribute much of HUD's housing counseling grant funding to community-based organizations that assist low- and moderate-income families to improve their housing conditions. In addition, these larger organizations help improve the quality of housing counseling services and enhance coordination among counseling providers. Read a comprehensive summary of each housing counseling grant.
Counseling improves housing outcomes for homebuyers, homeowners, and renters. Last year, HUD published research findings summarizing the impact of housing counseling has on families' housing options and choices (https://www.huduser.gov/portal/sites/default/files/pdf/Housing-Counseling-Works.pdf). In addition, recent research from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and the Urban Institute continue to find housing counselors provide substantial benefits for first time homebuyers and families struggling to prevent foreclosure.
Grant recipients address the full range of families' housing counseling needs. This includes helping homebuyers evaluate their readiness for a home purchase, understand their financing and down payment options, and navigate what can be an extremely confusing and difficult homebuying process. The organizations also help households find affordable rental housing and offer financial literacy training to individuals and families struggling to repair credit problems that restrict their housing options.
In addition to providing counseling to homeowners and renters, these organizations assist homeless persons in finding the transitional housing they need to move toward a permanent place to live. Finally, grantees also assist senior citizens seeking reverse mortgages. These agencies provide counseling for the rapidly growing number of elderly homeowners who seek to convert equity in their homes into income that can be used to pay for home improvements, medical costs, and other living expenses.
Housing counseling agencies also support fair housing by assisting borrowers in reviewing their loan documentation, to avoid potential mortgage scams, unreasonably high interest rates, inflated appraisals, unaffordable repayment terms, and other conditions that can result in a loss of equity, increased debt, default, and even foreclosure. Likewise, foreclosure prevention counseling helps homeowners facing delinquency or default employ strategies, including expense reduction, negotiation with lenders and loan servicers, and loss mitigation, to avoid foreclosure.
There are many ways to find a HUD-approved housing counseling agency. Visit HUD's website or call (800) 569-4287 for our interactive telephone directory.

10/11/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-117.cfm,HUD Approves Agreement Between Tenant and California Landlord Settling Claims of Disability Discrimination,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced an agreement between a woman with a disability and housing providers in Los Angeles, CA. The agreement resolves claims that owner, 4147 McClung Drive, LLC, Keeton Property Management, LLC, and the manager of one of its properties threatened the woman with eviction because she had an emotional support animal. Read the agreement.
The Fair Housing Act requires housing providers to make reasonable accommodations in their rules, policies, practices, and services when needed to provide persons with disabilities an equal opportunity to use or enjoy a dwelling. This includes waiving ""no-pets"" policies for persons with disabilities.
""Emotional support animals are essential to the ability of individuals with disabilities to function on a daily basis. They are not pets,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""This agreement highlights the importance of housing providers granting the reasonable accommodations they are required to provide under the law.""
The case came to HUD's attention when the woman filed a complaint alleging the property manager told her that she could not keep her dog and threatened to evict her, even though she had provided medical documentation attesting to her need for the support animal. The complaint further alleged that after receiving an eviction notice, she moved out of her home. The housing providers deny that they discriminated against the woman.
Under the terms of the agreement, the owners will pay the tenant $8,500 and provide fair housing training to its management and leasing staff.
April 2018 marked the 50th anniversary of the Fair Housing Act. In commemoration, HUD, local communities, housing advocates, and fair housing organizations across the country have coordinated a variety of activities to enhance awareness of fair housing rights, highlight HUD's fair housing enforcement efforts, and end housing discrimination in the nation.

10/15/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-119.cfm,HUD Invites Public Housing Agencies to Join Moving to Work Demonstration Program,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is inviting public housing agencies to join the Department's expanding Moving to Work demonstration program. Moving to Work (MTW) allows public housing agencies (PHAs) to practice greater program flexibility and encourages housing choice and self-sufficiency among low-income families. Read HUD's notice to PHAs.
""Cultivating self-sufficiency among low-income families is central to increasing their quality of life,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""Moving to Work provides families with a sense of stability and greater opportunity to pursue their goals.""
Currently, there are 39 MTW PHAs throughout the nation. In 2015, Congress allowed HUD to expand the MTW demonstration program to 100 additional PHAs over a seven-year period. Agencies for the first cohort of the MTW expansion will be chosen through a two-step selection process.
The MTW demonstration program encourages PHAs to develop unique self-sufficiency strategies, tailored to the needs of their local communities. These locally-designed strategies will improve upon the one-size-fits-all approach. In contrast to traditional PHAs, MTW agencies have flexibility to design and implement the Housing Choice Voucher Program and public housing programs to benefit the communities they serve. MTW PHAs can also streamline administrative procedures to run a more efficient and cost-effective operation.
The 100 new MTW PHAs will be added in four cohorts. Each cohort will implement affordable housing policies that fit their unique needs HUD will then study these tailored policy changes to learn what successful MTW innovations can be applied to all PHAs across the nation. The MTW Research Advisory Committee recommended the following policy changes that HUD will evaluate through the four cohorts: MTW flexibilities, rent reform, work requirements, and landlord incentives. The initial cohort of 30 high performing PHAs must administer 1000 or fewer Housing Choice Vouchers and public housing units combined. This cohort will experiment with the MTW flexibilities. The second cohort, rent reform, will be announced later this year.

EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take three months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, six months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2 percent) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percentage change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percentage changes are 90 percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percentage changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised 3 percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at the Census Bureau's website (https://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/how_the_data_are_collected/index.html).
* The 90 percent confidence interval includes zero. In such cases, there is insufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero."

The supplemental funding will help PHAs support existing and new families in the Housing Choice Voucher program who live in or around disaster areas.
""Public housing authorities play a tremendous role in assisting families and communities impacted by disasters,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""This increase in voucher funding allows housing authorities to serve more families who are still in unstable living conditions as a result of disasters."""
10/22/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-123.cfm,HUD Deputy Secretary Patenaude and Israeli Deputy Finance Minister Cohen Sign Joint Memorandum of Cooperation,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Deputy Secretary Pamela Hughes Patenaude, on behalf of HUD Secretary Ben Carson, and Israel's Deputy Finance Minister Yitzhak Cohen today signed a Memorandum of Cooperation to increase collaboration between the United States and the State of Israel on a host of housing, community development and mortgage finance issues. The signing took place in Jerusalem during a meeting of the U.S.-Israeli Joint Economic Development Group (JEDG). Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is leading the U.S. delegation on behalf of President Donald Trump.
The cooperative memorandum signed today establishes the formal exchange of information and research related to low- and moderate-income housing, mortgage and housing finance, rental housing assistance, management of public housing, and community development. Read the joint Memorandum of Cooperation.
""This cooperative agreement will serve as another building block in strengthening the close ties between our nations on a number of common issues that impact our citizens,"" said Patenaude. ""We plan to share research and best practices for addressing the affordable housing challenges facing our nations. I am convinced that working together, we will be able to learn from each other to improve the lives of those we serve.""
""The Memorandum of Cooperation on housing is an opportunity to deepen the close ties between Israel and the United States on an important issue that preoccupies both countries,"" said Cohen. ""Israel and the United States are facing very different housing challenges, but we can learn from these differences and cooperate on sharing acquired knowledge for the benefit of the next generations.""
Deputy Secretary Patenaude's visit to Israel and the formal execution of the Memorandum of Cooperation is the result of the extensive work following last year's JEDG meeting when Minister Kahlon led a delegation to Washington, D.C.
During this year's JEDG meeting, Deputy Secretary Patenaude is participating in a panel discussion on affordable housing with Zeev Bielski, the Head of the Israeli Housing Administration. She will also join a roundtable at the Urban Clinic at Hebrew University, tour an affordable housing development and visit a development built to withstand earthquakes."

Effective immediately, FHA-approved HECM servicers can use alternative supporting documentation in lieu of previously required materials that, in many instances, delayed claim processing. Read FHA's Mortgagee Letter.
FHA Commissioner Brian Montgomery said, ""Streamlining the HECM claim payment process makes us more responsive to participating lenders and helps continue our effort to put the program on a more financially viable path.""
FHA's new HECM claims payment requirements will ensure lenders participating in the program are not unduly burdened when seeking claims payments when the HECM reaches 98 percent of its maximum claim amount. By streamlining the requirements and relaxing the documentation burden during the claims process, FHA is seeking to reduce the time required to make timely claims payments to servicers."
10/22/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-125.cfm,Trump Administration Marks National Lead Poisoning Prevention Week,"WASHINGTON - To kick off National Lead Poisoning Prevention Week (NLPPW), leaders of President Donald Trump's Task Force on Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks to Children are raising awareness about the health risks associated with exposure to lead, specifically for children.
NLPPW, which will be held October 21-27, is an annual ""call to action"" aimed at bringing together families, individuals, community-based organizations, state, tribal, and local governments, and others, to protect current and future generations from exposures to lead-containing paint and dust, contaminated drinking water and soil, among other health risks.
The Task Force Co-Chairs, Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar, and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler, along with Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson are highlighting tools, products, and resources to assist partners at all levels in educating their communities about reducing lead hazards.
HUD estimates more than three million American households with children under the age of six are living with lead exposure hazards that can cause significant harm to their health.
""As a former pediatric neurosurgeon, I've seen the negative impact lead exposure can have on a child's developing brain,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes has been a significant contributor to the ongoing development of a federal strategy to eliminate childhood lead poisoning, ensuring kids have a foundation and a home environment that contributes to their ability to thrive.""
""The work of the President's Task Force on Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks to Children is a continuation of the Trump Administration's commitment to preventing future generations from being affected by lead exposure,"" said HHS Secretary Alex Azar. ""In children, lead exposure can result in serious effects on IQ, attention span, and academic achievement. Fortunately, we have made great progress through working with EPA and HUD on President Trump's task force, and I look forward to our continued collaboration on combating the threat of lead exposure to children.""
""Reducing lead exposure, particularly among children, is a top priority for EPA,"" said EPA Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler. ""We are in the process of completing several important actions to combat lead poisoning, such as publishing the new joint federal lead strategy, strengthening the dust-lead hazard standards, and overhauling the lead and copper rule for the first time in over two decades. Today, we are releasing a new document, Protecting Children from Lead Exposures, that will increase public awareness of the EPA programs and grants available to reduce lead exposure.""
During NLPPW, HUD is launching a new Healthy Homes-Youth app that teaches children about health hazards within the home, focusing on actions they and their families can take to eliminate risks. Versions for the iPhones, iPad, and iPod touch (using IOS 9.0 or later) can be downloaded here (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/healthy-homes-youth/id1434450117#?platform=iphone). HUD has also developed a Partner Information Kit, which provides resources for implementing local NLLPW activities, information about lead and lead poisoning prevention, tips for outreach, and more."
10/23/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-126.cfm,HUD Charges Wisconsin Landlords with Discriminating Against Families with Children,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today charged Chuck and Lynn Hietpas, the owners of a three-bedroom duplex in Kaukauna, WI, with discrimination for refusing to rent to a family because they have children. Read HUD's Charge.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to deny or limit housing because a family has children under the age of 18 and to make statements that discriminate against families with children.
""Denying rental opportunities to families simply because they have children not only robs them of the chance to obtain the housing they need, but it also violates the law,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will continue working to ensure that property owners and housing providers meet their obligation to treat all applicants the same.""
The case came to HUD's attention when a couple filed a complaint alleging that their rental application was denied because they have five children. The rental unit is large enough for the family under the local code, and three of the children would have only lived there part time. HUD's charge alleges that when the couple inquired about the status of their rental application, they were told one of the property owners was not comfortable with having five children living in the unit. The owners also allegedly told the couple they did not feel that the house would be cleaned properly and were concerned things would get damaged.
""Assuming that families with children make bad tenants is an unlawful stereotype,"" said Paul Compton, HUD's General Counsel. ""When a housing provider refuses to rent to a family because the family has children, the refusal violates the Fair Housing Act.""
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If the judge finds that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages to the complainant for harm caused by the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose fines to vindicate the public interest. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages.
Last April, HUD marked the 50th anniversary of the Fair Housing Act, joining local communities, housing advocates, and fair housing organizations across the country in a coordinated campaign to enhance awareness of fair housing rights. Persons who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY)."

Read HUD's Charge.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from denying or limiting housing to persons with disabilities or from refusing to make reasonable accommodations in policies or practices.
""For many individuals with disabilities, certain accommodations are necessary in order for them to fully enjoy their home,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will continue to take action to ensure that housing providers recognize and meet their obligation to comply with the nation's fair housing laws.""
HUD's charge alleges that the owners of Heathermoor II Apartments in Weirton, West Virginia, refused to grant a designated parking space to a resident with disabilities, despite the woman providing medical documentation attesting to her need for the accommodation. As a result, the woman and her children had to move to a different complex.
""When a resident needs a designated parking space as an accommodation for her disability and providing one will not be an undue burden or fundamental alteration, a housing provider must do so,"" said Paul Compton, HUD's General Counsel. ""We want housing providers to know what their legal responsibilities are and to follow them. If they don't, we will bring charges like this one.""
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If the judge finds that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages to the complainant for harm caused by the discrimination.

Moore Housing, Inc., owner of a Christiansburg, Virginia-based low-income housing provider, Metropolitan Property Management, Inc. of Washington, NC, and three managers with discrimination on the basis of disability.
HUD's Charge of Discrimination alleges that the housing providers discriminated against a resident with disabilities when they unreasonably delayed her request to install an automatic door opener to make it easier to use her wheelchair and then evicted her after refusing to allow her extra time, because of illness, to complete the development's annual income and family composition certification. Read HUD's Charge.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from refusing to allow persons with disabilities to make reasonable modifications to their home or refusing to make reasonable accommodations in their policies or practices.
""For three decades, persons with disabilities have had the right to be granted the accommodations they need to fully enjoy their home, but that right is still too often denied,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD is committed to ensuring that housing providers comply with the nation's fair housing laws, including fulfilling their obligation to meet the needs of residents with disabilities.""
As a result of the discrimination, the resident was evicted and has been without housing.
""HUD will vigorously enforce the rights of residents with disabilities to receive the reasonable accommodations and modifications they need to enjoy their homes,"" said HUD's General Counsel, Paul Compton.
The case will be heard in federal district court. If it is determined that illegal discrimination occurred, a judge may award actual and punitive damages, order injunctive, or other equitable relief to deter further discrimination, and order that defendants pay the couple's attorney fees.
April 2018 marked the 50th anniversary of the Fair Housing Act.

Read HUD's Charge.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits sexual harassment of tenants and other forms of housing discrimination based on race, sex, color, national origin, disability, religion and familial status.
""No one should have to submit to unwelcomed sexual advances as a condition for remaining in their home,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Today's charge sends a clear message to all landlords that HUD is committed to taking action against landlords whose behavior violate the Fair Housing Act.""
HUD's charge alleges that Ables showed the female complainants sexually explicit pictures and videos of women he identified as tenants, boasted that he had engaged in sexual acts with multiple female tenants, and asked the complainants to give him nude photos or videos in exchange for rent. HUD's charge further alleges that the owner disconnected the water to the complainants' unit after they rebuffed his advances.
The couple and their children eventually moved out after the owner accused them of paying their rent late and issued them a notice to vacate the property.
""Subjecting female tenants to sexual harassment is illegal, and HUD will continue to enforce the Fair Housing Act against property owners who engage in such misconduct,"" said Paul Compton, HUD's General Counsel. ""HUD is steadfastly committed to protecting the right of tenants to be free from sexual or other discriminatory harassment by their landlords.""
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court.

Specifically, HUD's charge alleges that the condo association only allowed the resident, who is sight and hearing impaired, to use the service door instead of the main entrance to the development or the common areas when accompanied by her assistance animal. HUD's charge further alleges that the condominium association charged the resident's daughter a fee because she walked her mother's assistance animal in the development's common areas. Read the charge.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from denying or limiting housing to persons with disabilities or from refusing to make reasonable accommodations in policies or practices.
""Subjecting someone to different residency requirements because they use an assistance animal prevents that person from fully enjoying their home and is against the law,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Condo associations have an obligation to comply with the requirements of the Fair Housing Act when it comes to reasonable accommodations and HUD is committed to ensuring that they meet that obligation.""
The case came to HUD's attention when the daughter of a condominium resident who uses an assistance animal filed a complaint alleging that the condominium association refused to waive its requirement that residents transport pets in carriers when in common areas, and was fined $100 for walking the animal in the development's common areas. Because of the resident's mobility impairments, her daughter was primarily responsible for walking the dog. Additionally, when the resident was with her assistance animal, she was required to use the service door to enter and exit the building.
""Rules that limit access to condominium common areas for persons with disabilities who need an assistance animal violate the Fair Housing Act,"" said J. Paul Compton Jr., HUD's General Counsel. ""This charge represents HUD's commitment to ensuring that persons with disabilities are allowed to fully use and enjoy their homes.""
The charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party elects for the case to be heard in federal court. If the administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he or she may award damages to the individual complainant for his or her loss as a result of the discrimination. The judge may also order other injunctive or equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties to vindicate the public interest.

11/01/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-132.cfm,Trump Administration Announces Decline in Veteran Homelessness,"WASHINGTON - Veteran homelessness in the U.S. continues to decline according to a new national estimate announced today by U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson. HUD's Annual Homeless Assessment Report finds the total number of reported veterans experiencing homelessness in 2018 decreased 5.4 percent since last year, falling to nearly half of the number of homeless veterans reported in 2010.
In announcing the latest annual estimate, HUD Secretary Ben Carson and U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) Secretary Robert Wilkie noted that local communities are reporting reductions in the number of veterans in their shelter systems and on their streets. View local estimates of veteran homelessness (https://www.hudexchange.info/resource/5772/2018-pit-estimate-of-veteran-homelessness-in-the-us/).
""We owe it to our veterans to make certain they have a place to call home,"" said HUD Secretary Carson. ""We've made great strides in our efforts to end veteran homelessness, but we still have a lot of work to do to ensure those who wore our nation's uniform have access to stable housing.""
""The reduction in homelessness among veterans announced today shows that the strategies we are using to help the most vulnerable veterans become stably housed are working,"" said VA Secretary Robert Wilkie. ""This is good news for all Veterans.""
""In Home, Together, the new federal strategic plan to prevent and end homelessness, we redouble our commitment to ending homelessness among Veterans and among all Americans,"" said Matthew Doherty, executive director of the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness. ""Working together at the federal, state and local level, we can and will continue to make progress until all Americans have a stable home from which they can pursue opportunity.""
Each year, thousands of local communities around the country conduct one-night 'Point-in-Time' estimates of the number of persons experiencing homelessness—in emergency shelters, transitional housing programs and in unsheltered locations. This year's estimate finds 37,878 veterans experienced homelessness in January 2018, compared to 40,020 reported in January 2017. HUD estimates among the total number of reported veterans experiencing homelessness in 2018, 23,312 veterans were found in sheltered settings while volunteers counted 14,566 veterans living in places not meant for human habitation.

HUD also reports a nearly 10 percent decline among female veterans experiencing homelessness. In January 2018, local communities reported 3,219 homeless female veterans compared to 3,571 one year earlier.
The decrease in veteran homelessness can largely be attributed to the effectiveness of the HUD-VA Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) Program, which combines permanent HUD rental assistance with case management and clinical services provided by the VA. HUD-VASH is complemented by a continuum of VA programs that use modern tools and technology to identify the most vulnerable Veterans and rapidly connect them to the appropriate interventions to become and remain stably housed. Last year alone, more than 4,000 veterans, many experiencing chronic forms of homelessness, found permanent housing and critically needed support services through the HUD-VASH program. An additional 50,000 veterans found permanent housing and supportive services through VA's continuum of homeless programs.

To date, 64 local communities and three states have declared an effective end to veteran homelessness, creating systems to ensure that a veteran's homelessness is rare, brief, and one-time. Read more (https://www.usich.gov/tools-for-action/map).
HUD and VA have a wide range of programs that prevent and end homelessness among veterans, including health care, housing solutions, job training and education.

11/07/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-133.cfm,HUD Reaches Agreement with Las Vegas Housing Landlords Settling Claims of Housing Discrimination,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has approved a Conciliation Agreement between a married couple with disabilities and the owners and managers of Silver Creek Apartments in Las Vegas, NV.
The agreement resolves allegations that the on-site manager denied the couple's request to move to a first-floor unit. The property is owned by Silver Creek LV, LLC, and managed by Stout Management Company, both located in Las Vegas. Read the agreement.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to discriminate in the sale, rental, and financing of dwellings, and in other housing-related transactions, based on disability. This includes refusing to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services or facilities related to housing.
""Housing providers need to understand that many people with mobility impairments rely on accommodations to fully enjoy their home, and that they have an obligation to provide those accommodations,"" said Anna María Farías HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Hopefully today's settlement will make more housing providers aware of their responsibilities under the Fair Housing Act.""
The case came to HUD's attention when a couple with disabilities who lived in Silver Creek Apartments filed a complaint alleging that they were denied the opportunity to move to a first-floor unit despite being told upon moving in that they would be able to transfer to a first-floor unit as soon as one became available.
The couple further alleged that they made the same request on numerous occasions over a seven-year period, but each time their request was denied even though they observed first-floor units being rented to others. According to the complaints, earlier this year, respondents approved the couple's request to move to a first-floor unit, but told them that they would have to pay a move-in fee of $700 and an additional $400 security deposit. The couple could not afford the extra costs and was forced to move out. The housing providers deny that they discriminated against the couple.
Under the Conciliation Agreement, Stout Management and Silver Creek LV, LLC, will pay the couple $6,000, forgive $1,392 in unpaid rent, and amend their Fair Housing policies to include information about reasonable accommodations. In addition, all leasing and management staff who work with tenants at Silver Creek Apartments will attend Fair Housing training.
Last April, HUD marked the 50th anniversary of the Fair Housing Act, joining local communities, housing advocates, and fair housing organizations across the country in a coordinated campaign to enhance awareness of fair housing rights.

HUD's charge further alleges that the owner used racial slurs in a text message he sent to the woman informing her that she did not get the apartment.
The Fair Housing Act makes it illegal to deny housing to someone because of his or her race or color. Read HUD's charge.
""50 years after our nation passed a law prohibiting discrimination in housing, some individuals are still being denied a place to live because of the color of their skin,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Today's action reflects HUD's commitment to protecting the rights of home seekers, no matter their race, and taking action against housing providers that break the law.""
The case came to HUD's attention when a woman filed a complaint alleging that and she and her young son were denied the opportunity to rent a two-bedroom apartment that was advertised on Craigslist because they are African-American. HUD's charge, on behalf of the woman, alleges that in text messages, the owner informed the woman that she did not ""make the cut"" and used racial slurs.
""No one looking for housing should be rejected because of race, much less be subjected to the indignity of racial slurs,"" said J. Paul Compton, HUD's General Counsel. ""This charge sends a clear message that HUD will protect the housing rights of all persons to the fullest extent of the law.""
HUD's charge will be heard by a administrative law judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages to the complainant for harm caused by discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose fines to vindicate the public interest. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages.

11/15/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-136.cfm,FHA Releases 2018 Annual Report to Congress,"WASHINGTON - The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) today released its 2018 Annual Report to Congress on the economic condition of the agency's Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMI Fund). FHA reports that at the end of Fiscal Year (FY) 2018, the MMI Fund had a total Economic Net Worth of $34.8 billion and a Capital Reserve Ratio that remains above the statutory minimum for a fourth consecutive year.
The MMI Fund supports FHA's single-family mortgage insurance programs, including all forward mortgage purchase and refinance transactions, as well as mortgages insured under the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM), or reverse mortgage program. While the value of FHA's forward mortgage portfolio is growing, the latest independent actuarial report finds the value of the agency's reverse mortgage portfolio continues to decline, representing a continuing economic drain on the MMI Fund from books of business in 2018 and earlier.
""The financial health of FHA's single-family insurance fund is sound,"" said U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson. ""FHA is in good hands, guarding against excessive risks, protecting the American taxpayer, and remaining true to our core mission to facilitate safe and affordable mortgage options for qualified borrowers.""
FHA Commissioner Brian Montgomery added, ""As we look to the future, FHA must continue to seek the right balance between facilitating access to mortgage credit and managing risk. Our number one mission is to make certain FHA remains a stable and reliable resource for first-time and minority homebuyers, and other underserved borrowers.""
This year's report continues to offer greater transparency, consistency and accountability in the economic fundamentals of the MMI Fund. For the second consecutive year, FHA is providing separate stand-alone capital ratios for its forward and reverse mortgage portfolios to better assess the impact of each on the MMI Fund. For a second year, the report also includes stress-testing of the portfolio based on historical scenarios.
FHA's 2018 Annual Report also includes important technical revisions to last year's report that reflect adjustments to the MMI Fund's Capital Ratio and Economic Net Worth for FY 2017.
KEY HIGHLIGHTS FROM FHA'S 2018 ANNUAL REPORT
The MMI Fund's FY 2018 Capital Ratio is 2.76 percent, a 0.58 percentage point increase over the restated FY 2017 Capital Ratio of 2.18 percent. This is the fourth consecutive year this ratio exceeded the statutory minimum of 2.00 percent. The MMI Fund's overall Economic Net Worth for FY 2018 is $34.86 billion, an increase of over 8 billion from FY 2017. Economic Net Worth is comprised of Total Capital Resources of $49.24 billion and a negative Cash Flow NPV of -$14.38 billion. FHA's cumulative Insurance-in-Force (IIF) reached $1.26 trillion of Unpaid Principal Balance (UPB) at the end of FY 2018, largely unchanged from FY 2017. FHA endorsed over one million forward mortgages in FY 2018 (including 776,284 purchase loans) totaling $209 billion in UPB. First-time homebuyers accounted for 641,921 or 82.7 percent of all FHA forward purchase loans. Minority homebuyers accounted for 33.8 percent of all FHA forward purchase loans. The average loan amount of FHA-insured forward mortgages was $206,041. The average borrower's credit score was 670 compared to 676 in FY 2017.

• The average borrower's credit score was 670 compared to 676 in FY 2017.
FHA'S HISTORICAL CAPITAL RESERVE RATIO
FHA maintains reserves to cover both future claims, as well as an additional statutorily required capital cushion of 2.0 percent of all Insurance-in-Force (IFF). This 'Capital Ratio' is calculated by dividing the Fund's Economic Net Worth ($34.8 billion in FY 2018) by total IFF of $1.26 trillion. As noted above, the FY 2018 Capital Ratio of the Fund is 2.76 percent, an increase from the end of FY 2017.

This year's Annual Report includes an examination of loan performance of FHA-insured homeowners impacted by last year's devastating hurricanes, analyzing the serious delinquency rate and early payment defaults among borrowers in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands impacted by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria.
HECM HIGHLIGHTS
FHA's HECM, or reverse mortgage, program continues to serve eligible seniors, 62 years and older, with a financing option that can help them remain in their home and age in place. Like last year, the 2018 Annual Report includes separate, stand-alone estimates of the capital resources and capital ratios for insured forward mortgages and HECMs.
The fiscal condition of FHA's forward mortgage portfolio is materially better than the HECM portfolio. Excluding HECMs, FHA's FY 2018 forward mortgages have a capital ratio of 3.93 percent and a positive Economic Net Worth of $46.8 billion. By contrast, the 2018 HECM portfolio has a negative capital ratio of 18.83 percent and a negative economic net worth of $13.63 billion.
In 2017, FHA implemented a set of changes to mortgage insurance premiums and Principal Limit Factors (PLFs) and followed in FY 2018 with changes to appraisal requirements. The impact of these changes on new HECM endorsements, and the ongoing performance of the outstanding HECM portfolio, will continue to be closely monitored and managed by FHA.
The 2018 Annual Report finds:
HECM endorsements declined 12.6 percent since last year, with 48,327 new mortgages endorsed. Total Capital Resources in the HECM portfolio totaled $2.11 billion for FY 2018, which was offset by a negative $15.75 billion in Cash Flow Net Present Value.

11/19/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-137.cfm,HUD Issues Order Settling Claim of Discrimination by New York Landlords Against Tenant with Disabilities,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced that Nolo Contendere, LLC, and Nolo Contendere LLC Trust, the owners and agent of an apartment complex in Syracuse, New York, will pay $15,000 under a HUD Consent Order resolving allegations that the owners and their agents refused to allow a woman with mental disabilities keep an assistance animal. Read the settlement agreement.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from denying or limiting housing to persons with disabilities and from refusing to make reasonable accommodations in policies or practices, which includes denying service animal requests.
""People who rely on assistance animals to maintain their independence shouldn't have their right to housing accommodations unlawfully denied,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will continue to ensure housing providers understand their rights and responsibilities under the law and take steps to meet those obligations.""
The case came to HUD's attention when a woman with mental disabilities filed a complaint alleging that Nolo Contendere, LLC, and its owners refused to allow her to keep an assistance animal. HUD's charge of discrimination alleged that after the tenant brought the animal home, an agent for Nolo Contendere confronted her about the animal. The landlords refused to make an exception to their ""no-pets"" policy, even after the woman provided documentation attesting to her disabilities. HUD's charge further alleged that the landlords initiated a retaliatory eviction action against the tenant after she made the accommodation request, in violation of the Fair Housing Act.
Under the terms of the Consent Order, entered by a HUD administrative law judge, the apartment owners will pay $15,000 to the woman, undergo fair housing training, and create a reasonable accommodation policy that allows residents with disabilities to keep assistance animals, including emotional support animals.
""This agreement highlights the importance of landlords following the law and making reasonable accommodations to their pet policies for tenants with disabilities,"" said J. Paul Compton Jr., HUD's General Counsel.
April 2018 marked the 50th anniversary of the passage of the Fair Housing Act. This year, HUD, local communities, housing advocates, and fair housing organizations across the country are conducting a variety of activities to enhance awareness of fair housing rights, highlight HUD's fair housing enforcement efforts, and end housing discrimination in the nation. For a list of activities, visit HUD.gov/FairHousingis50.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in housing because of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, disability and familial status.

EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take three months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, six months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2 percent) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percentage change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percentage changes are 90 percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percentage changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised 3 percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at the Census Bureau's website (https://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/how_the_data_are_collected/index.html).
* The 90 percent confidence interval includes zero. In such cases, there is insufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero."
11/21/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-139.cfm,HUD Awards $30 Million to Help Children in Foster Care,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today awarded $30 million to public housing authorities nationwide, which will work closely with local public welfare agencies to identify youth at risk of homelessness and families whose lack of adequate housing is the primary reason their children are in foster care.
This funding will make 3,000 vouchers available for families who are unable to secure affordable housing for their children or dependents.
""HUD is committed to helping parents and caregivers obtain safe and affordable housing for their families,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""This investment will allow thousands of children to leave the foster care system and live with their families so they have the opportunity to thrive together.""
""With this investment, Secretary Carson takes a major step forward in his plans to ensure that HUD resources provide a platform for strong families and opportunities for self-sufficiency"" said Ruth White, Executive Director of the National Center for Housing and Child Welfare. ""We applaud the Secretary for leading the way towards interagency collaboration that will reunify thousands of children with their parents, improve the economic prospects for youth leaving foster care, and ultimately reduce costs.""
The funding announced today is offered through HUD's Family Unification Program (FUP), which provides rental assistance to parents struggling to provide adequate housing for their children. Additionally, this funding can be used to help provide stable housing for young adults (ages 18-24) who have aged-out of the foster care system. Like HUD's Housing Choice Vouchers, these vouchers allow families to rent housing from a private landlord and generally pay 30 percent of their monthly adjusted gross income towards rent and utilities.
According to the National Center for Housing and Child Welfare (NCHCW), an affordable housing and child welfare advocacy group, keeping children in foster care is an expensive alternative to affordable housing. On average, it costs more than $48,000 annually per family when children enter foster care. By contrast, housing and services to keep a family together costs approximately $15,000 annually per family. Supportive services for FUP families and youth are provided by agencies funded through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. A $20 million investment in FUP vouchers saves more than $134 million in foster care costs.
Housing authorities that are awarded vouchers work closely with local public welfare agencies to identify youth at risk of homelessness and children who were placed in foster care due to lack of adequate housing.
Family Unification Program funding will be distributed to the following states:"

Read HUD's charge.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in housing based on disability, race, color, national origin, religion, sex and familial status. It also requires that covered multifamily housing dwellings must be designed and constructed to provide accessible and usable housing for individuals with disabilities.
""It can be very difficult for persons with disabilities to live in housing that does not meet the Fair Housing Act's design and construction requirements,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Hopefully HUD's action will help other housing owners and builders better understand their obligations under the Fair Housing Act, and encourage them to comply with the law.""
The case came to HUD's attention when Denver Metro Fair Housing Center (DMFHC), a HUD Fair Housing Initiatives Program agency, filed a complaint after fair housing tests on the complex indicated that it likely violated the Fair Housing Act. HUD's charge alleges that the owners and builders failed to design and construct the building in accordance with the Fair Housing Act because certain areas of the building are inaccessible to people with mobility impairments.
""The design and construction provisions of the Fair Housing Act ensure that individuals with disabilities have an equal opportunity to access and enjoy their homes within multifamily developments,"" said J. Paul Compton, HUD's General Counsel. ""HUD will continue to vigorously enforce the Fair Housing Act to advocate for persons with disabilities, and other protected classes, who face discrimination in housing.""
The case will be heard in federal district court. If it is determined that illegal discrimination occurred, a judge may award actual and punitive damages, order injunctive, or other equitable relief to deter further discrimination, and order that defendants pay the couple's attorney fees.
Last April, HUD marked the 50th anniversary of the Fair Housing Act, joining local communities, housing advocates, and fair housing organizations across the country in a coordinated campaign to enhance awareness of fair housing rights.

""The additional HUD-VASH vouchers awarded today will continue to support the important work of communities across the country that ensures our veterans have a safe and stable place to call home.""
""VA, HUD, and our federal, state and local partners are proud of the significant decline in Veteran homelessness achieved in recent years; however, important work remains,"" said VA Secretary Robert Wilkie. ""The housing choice vouchers and wraparound supportive service announced today will improve the lives of many Veterans who are currently homeless by helping them find a place to call home and reintegrate back into their families and communities.""
The HUD-VASH program combines rental assistance vouchers from HUD with case management and clinical services provided by VA. Since 2008, more than 93,000 vouchers have been awarded and approximately 150,000 homeless veterans have been served through the HUD-VASH program. More than 600 public housing authorities (PHAs) administer the HUD-VASH program, and this most recent award includes 25 additional PHAs, increasing HUD-VASH coverage to more communities.
In the HUD-VASH program, VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) assess veterans experiencing homelessness before referring them to local housing agencies for these vouchers. Decisions are based on a variety of factors, most importantly the duration of homelessness and the need for long-term, intensive support in obtaining and maintaining permanent housing. The HUD-VASH program includes both the rental assistance the voucher provides and the comprehensive case management that VAMC staff offers.
Veterans participating in the HUD-VASH program rent privately owned housing and generally contribute no more than 30 percent of their income toward rent. VA offers eligible homeless veterans clinical and supportive services through its medical centers across the U.S., Guam, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Read more about the HUD-VASH program.
In October, HUD and VA awarded $35 million to help more than 4,000 homeless veterans find homes. The funding ensured communities could provide the critically needed housing assistance and case management services to veterans and their families experiencing homelessness. The agencies also announced an additional $7.4 million through the Veterans Housing Rehabilitation and Modification Pilot (VHRMP) Program to assist disabled veterans with modifying or rehabilitating their homes, making them more accessible.

12/12/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-144.cfm,Secretary Carson to Lead White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council,"WASHINGTON - Today, President Donald Trump signed an Executive Order (https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/) establishing the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council and named U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson as its chairperson.
The Council's 13 Federal member agencies will engage with governments at all levels on ways to more effectively use taxpayer dollars to revitalize low-income communities. The Council will improve revitalization efforts by streamlining, coordinating, and targeting existing Federal programs to Opportunity Zones, economically distressed communities where new investments may be eligible for preferential tax treatment.
Additionally, the Council will consider legislative proposals and undertake regulatory reform to remove barriers to revitalization efforts and present the President with options to encourage capital investment in economically distressed communities.
""These are still early days for the work of the Council and Opportunity Zones, but the groundwork has been laid,"" Secretary Carson said. ""The seeds the President has planted are growing and the promise they hold will improve places long forgotten, and the lives of those who call those places home.""
President Trump signed the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, creating Opportunity Zones to stimulate long-term investments in low-income communities. The program offers capital gains tax relief to those who invest in these distressed areas. This program is anticipated to spur $100 billion in private capital investment in Opportunity Zones. Incentivizing investment in low-income communities fosters economic revitalization, job creation, and promotes sustainable economic growth across the nation, especially in communities HUD serves. Read more about the Opportunity Zones program (https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/tax-reform-creates-opportunity-zone-tax-incentive).
Opportunity Zones are a powerful vehicle for bringing economic growth and job creation to the American communities that need it the most. On average, the median family income in an Opportunity Zone is 37 percent below the state median. To date, 8,761 communities in all 50 States, Washington D.C., and five Territories have been designated as Opportunity Zones. Nearly 35 million Americans live in communities designated as Opportunity Zones.
Currently, there are approximately 380,000 Public Housing units and approximately 340,000 Project-Based Rental Assistance units within Opportunity Zones. Nearly a third of the more than 100,000 rental units preserved through HUD's Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) are located in Opportunity Zones. Read more about the RAD program."
12/14/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-145.cfm,HUD Announces New FHA Loan Limits for 2019,"WASHINGTON - The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) today announced the agency's new schedule of loan limits for 2019, with most areas in the country to experience an increase in loan limits in the coming year. These loan limits are effective for FHA case numbers assigned on or after January 1, 2019.
Read FHA's Mortgagee Letter on 2019 Forward Mortgage Limits. Read FHA's Mortgagee Letter on 2019 Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) Limits.
• Read FHA's Mortgagee Letter on 2019 Forward Mortgage Limits.
• Read FHA's Mortgagee Letter on 2019 Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) Limits.
FHA is required by the National Housing Act, as amended by the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA), to set Single Family forward loan limits at 115 percent of median house prices, subject to a floor and a ceiling on the limits. FHA calculates forward mortgage limits by Metropolitan Statistical Area and county.
In high-cost areas of the country, FHA's loan limit ceiling will increase to $726,525 from $679,650. FHA will also increase its floor to $314,827 from $294,515. Additionally, the National Mortgage Limit for FHA-insured Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECMs), or reverse mortgages, will increase to $726,525 from $679,650. FHA's current regulations implementing the National Housing Act's HECM limits do not allow loan limits for reverse mortgages to vary by MSA or county; instead, the single limit applies to all mortgages regardless of where the property is located.
Due to robust increases in median housing prices and required changes to FHA's floor and ceiling limits, which are tied to the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA)'s increase in the conventional mortgage loan limit for 2019, the maximum loan limits for FHA forward mortgages will rise in 3,053 counties. In 181 counties, FHA's loan limits will remain unchanged. By statute, the median home price for a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) is based on the county within the MSA having the highest median price. It has been HUD's long-standing practice to utilize the highest median price point for any year since the enactment of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act (HERA).
The National Housing Act, as amended by HERA, requires FHA to establish its floor and ceiling loan limits based on the loan limit set by FHFA for conventional mortgages owned or guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. FHA's 2019 minimum national loan limit, or floor, of $314,827 is set at 65 percent of the national conforming loan limit of $484,350. This floor applies to those areas where 115 percent of the median home price is less than the floor limit.
Any areas where the loan limit exceeds this ‘floor' is considered a high-cost area, and HERA requires FHA to set its maximum loan limit ‘ceiling' for high-cost areas at 150 percent ($726,525) of the national conforming limit.
Based upon the volume of FHA endorsements in FY 2018, the following chart represents the number and share of counties where FHA loan limits are at the ceiling, floor and somewhere in between.

The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) also today sent a letter to NYCHA providing that NYCHA has until January 31, 2019, to produce a plan of action acceptable to HUD that remediates NYCHA's longstanding issues with management, lead, mold, heat, elevators, and vermin. If an acceptable arrangement is not reached, HUD intends to declare NYCHA in substantial default of its legal obligation to provide decent, safe, and healthy housing to its residents. This would provide to HUD Secretary Ben Carson a wide range of remedies under the United States Housing Act of 1937 and other legal authorities.
""Declaring substantial default is never our first choice but unless and until New York City can produce an acceptable roadmap forward, I will not hesitate to exercise my legal authority to impose more serious sanctions,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""The families who are enduring unimaginably poor housing conditions deserve better from their housing authority. We need bold new solutions for an old problem and I earnestly hope the City is serious about turning a new page for NYCHA.""
HUD will not agree to any arrangement put forward by NYCHA unless it establishes tangible goals and milestones to address serious health and safety hazards in the housing authority's properties, including lead-based paint hazards and mold.
Any plan produced by NYCHA also must address the following set of key principles:
A sustainable commitment to decent, safe and sanitary affordable housing using all tools available Setting specific performance targets for lead, mold, elevator, heat and vermin issues Robust oversight to assure remediation objectives are met Milestones for measuring meaningful progress toward remediation goals and other institutional improvements at NYCHA Reduction of unwarranted costs and elimination of bureaucratic impediments to efficient operations Management of the highest quality and commitment Local control of day-to-day operations by NYCHA and New York City Strong remedies that are immediately available to address any future failure to perform, whether in the case of individuals or organizational structures Commitment of all relevant emergency powers available to NYCHA by New York City and New York State Commitment of additional financial resources from New York City and New York State for remediation and future sustainability

12/17/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-147.cfm,HUD Reports Homelessness Unchanged in U.S. in 2018 with Notable Declines Among Veterans and Families with Children,"WASHINGTON - Homelessness in the U.S. remained largely unchanged in 2018, according to the latest national estimate by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). HUD's 2018 Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress (https://www.hudexchange.info/resources/documents/2018-AHAR-Part-1.pdf) found that 552,830 persons experienced homelessness on a single night in 2018, an increase of 0.3 percent since last year. Meanwhile, homelessness among veterans fell 5.4 percent and homelessness experienced by families with children declined 2.7 percent nationwide since 2017.
As in previous years, there is significant local variation in the data reported from different parts of the country. Thirty-one (31) states and the District of Columbia reported decreases in homelessness between 2017 and 2018 while 19 states reported increases in the number of persons experiencing homelessness.
""Our state and local partners are increasingly focused on finding lasting solutions to homelessness even as they struggle against the headwinds of rising rents,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""Much progress is being made and much work remains to be done but I have great hope that communities all across our nation are intent on preventing and ending homelessness.""
""Communities across the country are getting better and better at making sure that people exit homelessness quickly through Housing First approaches,"" said Matthew Doherty, executive director of the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness. ""We know, however, that a lack of housing that people can afford is the fundamental obstacle to making further progress in many communities.""
HUD's national estimate is based upon data reported by approximately 3,000 cities and counties across the nation. Every year on a single night in January, planning agencies called 'Continuums of Care', along with tens of thousands of volunteers, seek to identify the number of individuals and families living in emergency shelters, transitional housing programs and in unsheltered settings. These one-night 'snapshot' counts, as well as full-year counts and data from other sources (U.S. Housing Survey, Department of Education), are crucial in understanding the scope of homelessness and measuring progress toward reducing it.

Key Findings of HUD's 2018 Annual Homeless Assessment Report:
On a single night in January 2018, state and local planning agencies (Continuums of Care) reported:
552,830 people were homeless representing an overall 0.3 percent increase from 2017 but a 13.2 percent decrease since 2010. This small increase is due to two factors: a 2.3 percent increase of unsheltered homelessness; and, nearly 4,000 persons staying in emergency shelters set up in areas impacted by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria, and Nate; western wildfires; and other storms and events. Most homeless persons (358,363) were located in emergency shelters or transitional housing programs while 194,467 persons were unsheltered. The number of families with children experiencing homelessness declined 2.7 percent since 2017 and 29 percent since 2010. On a single night in January 2018, 37,878 veterans experienced homelessness, a decline of 5.4 percent (or 2,142 persons) since January 2017. The number of female veterans dropped nearly 10 percent since last year. Overall, Veteran homelessness in the U.S. declined by 49 percent since 2010. 88,640 individuals experienced long-term homelessness in 2018, an increase of 2.2 percent over 2017 levels though chronic homelessness declined by 16.4 percent (or 17,422 persons) since 2010. The number of unaccompanied homeless youth and children in 2018 is estimated to be 36,361, a 5.1 percent decline since 2017. Last year, HUD and local communities launched a more intense effort to more accurately account for this important, difficult-to-count population. HUD is treating 2017 as a baseline year for purposes of tracking progress toward reducing youth homelessness.

Family Homelessness
HUD's latest national estimate notes a continuing decline in family homelessness in the U.S. In January of 2018, there were 56,342 family households with children experiencing homelessness, a 29 percent decline since 2010. These declines are largely a consequence of HUD's policy shift from supporting higher cost transitional housing to rapid rehousing programs across the country. Following HUD's guidance and best practices, local planners are increasingly using rapid rehousing to move families into permanent housing more quickly and at lower cost. Communities are also implementing more prevention activities to help families avoid needing shelter as well as more robust coordinated entry efforts. Taken together, these 'Housing First' models have proven to be a more effective and efficient response to help families experiencing temporary crisis as well as those enduring the most chronic forms of homelessness.
Veteran Homelessness
Veteran homelessness in the U.S. is nearly half of what was reported in 2010. Last year alone, the number of homeless veterans declined by 5.4 percent and homelessness experienced by female veterans dropped by nearly 10 percent. These declines are the result of intense planning and targeted interventions, including the close collaboration between HUD and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Both agencies jointly administer the HUD-VA Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) Program, which combines permanent HUD rental assistance with case management and clinical services provided by the VA. This year, more than 4,400 veterans, many experiencing chronic forms of homelessness, will find permanent housing and critically needed support services through the HUD-VASH program. An additional 50,000 veterans found permanent housing and supportive services through VA's continuum of homeless programs.
Chronic Homelessness
Long-term or chronic homelessness among individuals with disabilities grew by 2.2 percent since 2017 though is 16.4 percent below the levels reported in 2010. This longer trend is due in part to a concerted effort to make more permanent supportive housing opportunities more available for people with disabling health conditions who otherwise continually cycle through local shelters or the streets. Research demonstrates that for those experiencing chronic homelessness, providing permanent housing, coupled with appropriate low-barrier supportive services, is the most effective solution for ending homelessness. This 'housing first' approach also saves the taxpayer considerable money by interrupting a costly cycle of emergency room and hospital, detox, and even jail visits.

Read the Order.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from denying or limiting housing to persons with disabilities and from refusing to make reasonable accommodations in policies or practices.
""No family whose members have disabilities should be denied the reasonable accommodations they need to make a home for themselves,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Hopefully, today's ruling will remind homeowner associations of their obligations under the Fair Housing Act and encourage them to follow the law.""
Under the terms of the Consent Order, entered by a HUD administrative law judge, Tamaron Association will pay a civil penalty of $9,000 to the United States, undergo fair housing training, and make changes to the associations' bylaws as they relate to reasonable accommodations. The wife, now a widow, is pursuing claims against Tamaron Association in New Jersey State Court. Tamaron Association denies that it discriminated against the family.
""HUD is committed to ensuring that housing providers, including homeowner associations, do not discriminate against individuals with disabilities,"" said Paul Compton, HUD's General Counsel. ""This Consent Decree is a reminder to housing providers that making reasonable accommodations for persons with disabilities is an essential part of their legal obligation under the Fair Housing Act.""
April 2018 marked the 50th anniversary of the passage of the Fair Housing Act. This year, HUD, local communities, housing advocates, and fair housing organizations across the country are conducting a variety of activities to enhance awareness of fair housing rights, highlight HUD's fair housing enforcement efforts, and end housing discrimination in the nation. For a list of activities, visit HUD.gov/FairHousingis50.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in housing because of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, disability and familial status. People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY).

12/19/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-149.cfm,HUD Awards $139 Million to Protect Families from Lead and Home Hazards,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today awarded more than $139 million to 48 state and local government agencies to protect children and families from lead-based paint and home health hazards.
HUD Secretary Ben Carson made the grant announcement today during an event with the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Health and Human Services to unveil the Federal Action Plan to Reduce Childhood Lead Exposure (https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2018-12/documents/fedactionplan_lead_final.pdf). The Federal Lead Action Plan is a blueprint for reducing lead exposure through collaboration among federal agencies to diminish childhood exposure to lead from lead-based paint and other sources.
These grants are provided through HUD's Lead-Based Paint Hazard Control and Lead-Based Paint and Lead Hazard Reduction Demonstration grant programs to identify and clean up dangerous lead in low-income housing. These grants include nearly $18 million through HUD's Healthy Homes Supplemental funding to help communities with housing-related health and safety hazards unrelated to lead-based paint.
These investments will protect families and children by targeting health hazards in approximately 6,500 low-income homes with significant lead and health hazards. HUD's lead hazard control grant programs have successfully filled critical needs for remediating housing hazards, focusing on the most vulnerable residents of communities with limited local resources to address these hazards.
""Today, we take another important step toward creating safer and healthier homes for families and their children,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""At HUD, one of our most important missions is to provide people with safe and reliable housing, and these grants will help states and local communities eliminate lead-based paint and other health hazards from low-income homes.""
""Millions of families live in housing that threatens their health and safety,"" said Matthew Ammon, Director of HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes. ""This year, HUD is expanding our reach into 16 cities for the first time to directly support their efforts to identify and clean up potentially dangerous hazards like lead and mold.""
HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes promotes local efforts to eliminate dangerous lead paint and other housing-related health hazards from lower income homes; stimulates private sector investment in lead hazard control; supports cutting-edge research on methods for assessing and controlling housing-related health and safety hazards; and educates the public about the dangers of hazards in the home. Read a complete project-by-project summary of the programs awarded grants today.

""HUD is delighted to join the other members of the Task Force in issuing this cohesive Federal Lead Action Plan,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""Implementing this plan will help federal agencies, along with our state and local partners, advance efforts to remediate home health hazards and keep children safe from lead poisoning.""
""The Federal Lead Action Plan will enhance the Trump Administration's efforts to identify and reduce lead contamination while ensuring children impacted by lead exposure are getting the support and care they need,"" said EPA Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler. ""EPA will develop an implementation plan by March 2019 that will enable us to track our progress and update the public as we work to carry out the action plan and mitigate childhood lead exposure.""
""The Trump administration's new Lead Action Plan reflects our strong commitment to preventing future generations from being affected by lead exposure,"" said HHS Secretary Alex Azar. ""We know that lead exposure at a young age can result in serious effects on IQ, attention span, and academic achievement. We need to continue taking action to prevent these harmful effects. Identifying lead-exposed children, connecting them with appropriate services, and preventing other children from being exposed to lead are important public health priorities for this administration.""
Secretary Carson, Administrator Wheeler, and Deputy Secretary Hargan released the Lead Action Plan in front of a crowd of over 30 dedicated career employees from EPA, HHS, and HUD who helped develop the plan.
Developed through cross-governmental collaboration of the President's Task Force on Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks to Children (Task Force), which includes 17 federal departments and offices, the Lead Action Plan is a blueprint for reducing lead exposure and associated harms by working with a range of stakeholders, including states, tribes and local communities, along with businesses, property owners and parents.
The four goals of the Lead Action Plan are:
Goal 1: Reduce Children's Exposure to Lead Sources Goal 2: Identify Lead-Exposed Children and Improve their Health Outcomes Goal 3: Communicate More Effectively with Stakeholders Goal 4: Support and Conduct Critical Research to Inform Efforts to Reduce Lead Exposures and Related Health Risks
• Goal 1: Reduce Children's Exposure to Lead Sources
• Goal 2: Identify Lead-Exposed Children and Improve their Health Outcomes
• Goal 3: Communicate More Effectively with Stakeholders
• Goal 4: Support and Conduct Critical Research to Inform Efforts to Reduce Lead Exposures and Related Health Risks
The Lead Action Plan will help federal agencies work strategically and collaboratively to reduce exposure to lead and improve children's health. EPA and members of the Task Force will continue to engage with and reach out to community stakeholders such as non-governmental organizations.

Background
The President's Task Force on Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks to Children, which was established in 1997 by Executive Order 13045, is the focal point for federal collaboration to promote and protect children's environmental health. The Task Force is currently co-chaired by Acting EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler and HHS Secretary Alex Azar.
Since the 1970s, the United States has made tremendous progress in lowering children's blood lead levels. Lead exposure, particularly at higher doses, continues to pose a significant health and safety threat to children, preventing them from reaching the fullest potential of their health, their intellect, and their future. No safe blood lead level in children has been identified.
Tackling the problem at this stage requires a coordinated federal-wide effort that evaluates the predominant sources of lead and improves identification and treatment of children identified as lead exposed. It requires a more robust and coordinated communication with parents and others regarding the risks and methods to reduce exposure and a collaborative multi-agency research plan - as outlined by the Lead Action Plan."
12/21/2018:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2018/pr18-151.cfm,HUD Awards $29 Million to Promote Employment and Self-Sufficiency for Public Housing Residents,"WASHINGTON - In an effort to help public housing residents become self-sufficient, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today awarded nearly $29 million in grants to public housing authorities and non-profit organizations across the nation to hire or retain service coordinators to help residents find jobs and educational opportunities. See list of grant funding by state.
HUD's Resident Opportunities and Self Sufficiency - Service Coordinators Program (ROSS-SC) helps public housing authorities, resident associations, non-profit organizations, Indian tribes or entities representing Indian tribes hire or retain ""service coordinators"" who work directly with residents to assess their needs and connect them with education, job training and placement programs, and/or computer and financial literacy services available in their community to promote self-sufficiency.
""Providing families who live in public housing the opportunity to invest in themselves is a win-win as it helps them to gain economic and housing independence,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""Today, we're investing in our residents, offering them the tools they need to build a brighter future for themselves and their children.""
The purpose of HUD's ROSS-SC program is to encourage local, innovative strategies that link public housing assistance with public and private resources to enable participating families to increase earned income; reduce or eliminate the need for welfare assistance; and make progress toward achieving economic independence and housing self-sufficiency."
