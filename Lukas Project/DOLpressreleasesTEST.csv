On Sept. 18, 2023, the department announced a National Dislocated Worker Grant of up to $20 million – with an initial award of $6.6 million – to the Florida Department of Commerce to provide people with temporary employment focused on debris removal, water damage cleanup and the delivery of humanitarian assistance to those affected by the storm, and for career and training services for affected workers. Funding also supports career and training services for area workers. On Aug. 30, 2023, Hurricane Idalia struck the northeastern Gulf Coast as a Category 3 storm, bringing strong winds, storm surges and massive flooding to the region. The incremental award announced today will continue to support disaster-relief jobs and employment and training services to assist people in 33 counties. The Federal Emergency Management Agency issued the emergency declaration on Aug. 28, 2023, and the major disaster declaration on Aug. 31, 2023, enabling the state to request federal assistance for recovery efforts. Administered by the department’s Employment and Training Administration , and supported by the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2014 , National Dislocated Worker Grants provide funding assistance to temporarily expand the service capacity of dislocated worker programs at the state and local levels when large, unexpected economic events cause significant job losses."

Broadway Ave. Bismarck, ND Action: Wage and Hour Division investigation Action: The Department of Labor has recovered $73,680 in overtime wages for 76 employees of Lasting Love Homecare LLC after an investigation by the department’s Wage and Hour Division found the Bismarck employer incorrectly claimed an exemption in North Dakota state administrative code (link is external) and violated federal overtime regulations for overtime. The home care provider also incurred recordkeeping violations. Investigators found Lasting Love Homecare paid straight time for overtime hours worked to 76 non-exempt employees. The employer wrongly understood state law related to overtime exemptions for domestic service workers and failed to recognize that, as third-party employers, they are ineligible to claim the exemption. The division determined the affected workers were owed time and one-half their hourly rate-of-pay for hours over 40 in a workweek. Quote: “Home care workers play a vital role in assisting older adults and individuals with disabilities to maintain their independence and engage with their communities. In return, their employers must pay these workers all of their hard-earned wages, including overtime when required.” said Wage and Hour District Director David Skinner in Denver. “We encourage employers to review their pay practices and to contact the Wage and Division to avoid compliance issues and their sometimes-costly consequences.” Background : In fiscal year 2023, the Wage and Hour Division recovered more than $31.8 million in back wages for workers in the healthcare industry nationwide.

Investigators found $42,265 in back wages owed to 47 Promised Land Truck Stop workers and $17,425 in back wages owed to 18 Whistle Stop employees, plus equal amounts in liquidated damages. The division also assessed $45,722 in civil money penalties against the employer for the employer’s willful violations. After the employer refused to resolve the violations, the department’s Office of the Solicitor filed a complaint in August 2018 against both companies and Tahir. In its July 2020 summary judgment, the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania affirmed that the employer violated the law and owed the amounts the department sought. In February 2021, the employer appealed the civil money penalties to the Office of Administrative Law Judges, which reduced the penalty to $13,800 in its October 2022 decision and order. In March 2023, the department filed a Petition for Review of the Decision and Order with the Administrative Review Board to appeal the OALJ decision. Resolution: On July 18, 2024, the ARB issued a decision and order that reversed the OALJ decision and required the employer to pay the $45,723 civil money penalties first assessed. Quotes: “The Wage and Hour Division assessed the civil money penalties against the employer due to their willful disregard of the law, and the Administrative Review Board affirmed our original assessment,” explained Wage and Hour Division District Director Jo-Ann Gregory in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. “The outcome in this case shows that the U.S. Department of Labor will use all necessary litigation tools to hold employers accountable when they deny workers their hard-earned wages and try to avoid the costly consequences,” explained Regional Solicitor of Labor Samantha Thomas in Philadelphia."
"August 15, 2024",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20240815,"US Department of Labor reminds Michigan employers of responsibilities, temporary workers of rights for safe working conditions, fair wages","GRAND RAPIDS, MI – As Michigan’s harvest season swings into high gear, the U.S. Department of Labor wants to remind employers of their responsibilities and seasonal workers of their rights under federal law. Every summer and fall, Michigan’s vast fields are filled with agricultural workers hand harvesting the state’s seasonal bounty of crops. Many of those workers come to the U.S. to work for farmers under the federal H-2A temporary visa program. The H-2A program allows agricultural employers anticipating a shortage of domestic workers to bring nonimmigrant foreign workers to the U.S. to perform agricultural labor or services of a temporary or seasonal nature. Michigan is among the top 10 states with employers that regularly hire workers under this program. The state has about 870 licensed housing sites that accommodate about 23,000 temporary workers. The department’s Wage and Hour Division is conducting outreach with advocates and workers throughout the harvest season to educate them on federal laws – including the revised H-2A farmworker protection final rule , the Fair Labor Standards Act , and the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act – that set standards for safe and clean housing, transportation and fair wages. “Our outreach is putting a spotlight on key protections for H-2A farm workers including written contracts, free and safe transportation, safe housing and promised wages,” explained Wage and Hour District Director Mary O’Rourke in Grand Rapids, Michigan. “One of the most common violations we find involves employers failing to pay the H-2A Adverse Effect Wage Rate , which is $18.50 per hour in Michigan in 2024, because they pay workers on a piece-rate basis and don’t ensure workers get paid at least the required rate for all hours worked.” Key protections for H-2A workers include: Payment for all recruitment and visa costs. Reimbursement for the trip to the job site and payment for the return trip to their home country. Free and safe housing, and a sanitary kitchen to prepare meals if meals are not provided. Free and safe daily transportation with working safety restraints. The opportunity to work at least three-fourths of the hours agreed upon in their contract. The right to file a complaint or participate in an investigation without fear of retaliation. “Employers agree to these key protections when they apply to the Department of Labor to hire temporary visa workers,” added Wage and Hour District Director Timolin Mitchell in Detroit. “Approval of their applications comes with a tacit acknowledgment that they will pay these workers a fair wage and treat them with the respect and dignity that all workers deserve. Employers with questions about wage laws should reach out to our compliance experts for assistance .” The department’s revised H-2A farmworker protection final rule , which went into effect on June 28, 2024, adds further protections for temporary migrant workers from labor exploitation and human trafficking as well as additional safety requirements. “All too often we find vulnerable workers – like those in the country for seasonal work – fear coming forward when they experience unsafe working conditions, unsanitary housing or short paychecks,” O’Rourke added. “The goal of our outreach is to make sure these workers are fully aware of the resources available to them if they have questions or concerns. These resources include nine local migrant resource councils (link is external) in Michigan, the Consulate of Mexico in Detroit and the U.S. Department of Labor .” View the department’s Agriculture Compliance Assistance Toolkit.

The agreement follows an investigation by the department’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration into the failure by Mar-Jac Poultry to use required safety procedures that would have kept a teenaged worker from being fatally caught in a machine as they cleaned it in July 2023. In addition to abating all violations cited by OSHA , Mar-Jac Poultry MS LLC must implement the following enhancements: Add another properly trained supervisor to the sanitation shift. Provide workers exposed to lockout/tagout and machine guarding hazards with updated training. Require the plant’s manager and safety director to complete OSHA’s 30-hour general industry training and plant supervisors to complete OSHA’s 10-hour training. Institute a system for assigning, identifying and issuing locks to authorized employees performing lockout/tagout functions and update programs and training to reflect this requirement. Conduct a risk and hazard assessment to evaluate the safety exposures and hazards associated with current lockout/tagout procedures for the sanitation shift. The assessment must include a review of any incidents, including near misses, injuries and unexpected start-ups or malfunctions of machinery. Perform monthly lockout/tagout safety audits for the sanitation shift for one year and provide proof to OSHA, including what steps the employer is taking to reduce hazards in response to the audits. “Tragically, a teenage boy died needlessly before Mar-Jac Poultry took required steps to protect its workers,” said OSHA Regional Administrator Kurt Petermeyer in Atlanta. “ This settlement demands the company commit to a safer workplace environment and take tangible actions to protect their employees from well-known hazards. Enhanced supervision and increased training can go a long way toward minimizing risks faced by workers in meat processing facilities.” OSHA offers small and medium-size employers no-cost safety consultation services to assist them in developing a comprehensive safety program to prevent incidents that can cause serious and fatal injuries. Headquartered in Gainesville, Georgia, Mar-Jac Poultry has raised live birds for poultry production since 1954 at facilities in Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi for food service customers in the U.S and abroad.

"August 14, 2024",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20240814,US Department of Labor cites leading convenience store chain for serious violation after gunmen shoot cashier in Orlando robbery,"ORLANDO, FL – A subsidiary of one of the world’s best-known operators of convenience stores and fueling stations could have prevented a store cashier in Orlando from suffering a serious gunshot injury by following the company’s own established safety procedures, a U.S. Department of Labor investigation has found. Inspectors with the department’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration learned that two unidentified men entered the Circle K location on Silver Star Road shortly after 1 a.m. on Jan. 19, 2024, pointed firearms and screamed at the cashier to open the register. As the employee moved back from the register, one of the assailants fired a shot that struck the employee in the left shoulder. “People employed by late or all-night businesses, such as gas stations, convenience stores and drive-through fast food restaurants face a high probability of violent incidents as few witnesses, accessible cash, poorly lit stores and darkened parking areas often attract dangerous thieves,” explained OSHA Area Director Erin Sanchez in Orlando, Florida. “Gratefully, the cashier in this case survived the attack, but not all workers at Circle K and other similar businesses have been as fortunate.” OSHA cited Circle K Stores Inc. with one serious violation for failing to provide a place of employment free from recognized hazards likely to cause death or serious physical harm. The agency has proposed $16,131 in penalties , the maximum amount allowed by federal statute. The company has contested the findings before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission (link is external) . A review of OSHA investigations of Circle K locations since 2014 finds five workers suffered fatal gunshot injuries at two locations in Texas in August 2021 and December 2018, Georgia in September 2019, Florida in June 2016 and Alabama in December 2015. The majority of these incidents took place in the evening or overnight hours. Deterrents to help late-night retailers protect employees from workplace violence include interior and exterior security cameras, cash register barriers or enclosures, a drop safe or cash management device, proper lighting inside and outside the store and signage explaining the register holds $50 or less. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health cites robbery-related homicides and assaults as the leading cause of death for retail workers. In 2019, the rate of deadly workplace violence among convenience store workers was 14 times higher than the overall rate for private industry workers (link is external) . OSHA offers recommendations for workplace violence prevention programs in late-night retail establishments with employers’ tips to design and implement programs to prevent workplace violence. A subsidiary of Couche-Tard in Quebec, Canada - operating more than 16,700 stores in 29 countries and territories and employing more than 150,000 people - Circle K Stores Inc. is one of the largest U.S. independent convenience store operators.

The action comes after federal investigators uncovered oppressive child labor at a Morristown manufacturing facility that produces outdoor power equipment for major companies including John Deere, Toro and Yamaha. Entered on Aug. 12, 2024, in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee, the court’s action comes after the department’s Wage and Hour Division discovered several children employed in dangerous jobs at a plant operated by Tuff Torq Corp . The division found that Professional Personnel Service Inc., operating as Luttrell Staffing in Kingsport, employed several children to work at Tuff Torq in violation of the child labor provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act. “The court’s action reflects the U.S. Department of Labor’s relentless pursuit of any employer that endangers children by employing them to work in dangerous jobs,” explained Regional Solicitor Tremelle Howard in Atlanta. “Staffing agencies have a responsibility to make sure children are not being employed illegally and that their safety and well-being are never jeopardized in the pursuit of profit.” In addition to ordering Luttrell Staffing to comply with federal child labor regulations, the court ordered the employer to pay $121,572 in civil money penalties. “ When employers fail to keep children in our communities safe from workplace dangers, the U.S. Department of Labor will act swiftly to hold violators accountable for their actions,” said Wage and Hour Regional Administrator Juan Coria in Atlanta. “This case affirms our commitment to hold all employers, including staffing agencies, accountable when they violate federal child labor laws.” In addition to paying civil penalties, Luttrell Staffing was ordered to take the following actions: Provide the Wage and Hour Division with a list of all children employed, including specifying the age, current and anticipated hours of work, job duties assigned and types of machines the child operates. Hire a third-party compliance specialist for a period of three years to monitor compliance with the FLSA’s child labor provisions. Submit a report to the division within 180 days, outlining steps taken to comply with FLSA child labor requirements and then provide annual reports with updates. Use the division’s Youth Employment Compliance Assistance Toolkit to identify materials for use in training managers and employees, provided in a language understood by all individuals. Coordinate with the compliance specialist for three years to provide child labor compliance training to all management personnel twice a year and to provide training as part of the company’s orientation process for all new managers. Establish a toll-free number that allows employees to report violations anonymously. Add child labor provisions in the template for contracts with all clients. Contracts must also include the compliance specialist’s name and contact information to allow clients to contact them directly with questions or concerns regarding child labor violations. Luttrell Staffing provides employers with workers at 40 locations in California, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Vermont and Virginia. The company’s employees work in light industrial, warehouse, general and skilled labor, construction, and office and clerical jobs. Luttrell has corporate headquarters in Kingsport, Tennessee, and in Bowling Green, Kentucky. In fiscal year 2023, the department investigated 955 cases with child labor violations involving 5,792 children nationwide – an 88 percent increase since 2019 – including 502 children employed in violation of hazardous occupation standards. The department addressed those violations by assessing employers more than $8 million in civil money penalties.

For the seventh time since 2013, the U.S. Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration cited Dromin Development LLC for not providing required safety equipment and training to employees building a new home in Frankfort. The company currently owes more than $114,000 in unpaid penalties for similar willful and serious violations. The March 2024 inspection in Frankfort determined Dromin allowed employees to work at heights greater than six feet without fall protection and failed to provide training in fall protection and proper forklift operation. OSHA also noted workers failed to wear hard hats and used ladders improperly. OSHA cited the Palos Park construction contractor for two repeat violations and one willful, one serious and one other-than-serious violation. The agency has proposed $268,309 in penalties. “Each year, hundreds of workers die in preventable falls. Making sure workers wear fall protection each time they work at heights six feet or greater can be the difference between life or death,” said OSHA’s Chicago South Area Director James Martineck in Tinley Park, Illinois. “OSHA continues to work with the construction industry to address this deadly hazard and will continue to hold all employers accountable when they fail to provide safe working conditions.” The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that 1,056 construction workers died on the job in 2022, with 423 of those fatalities related to falls from elevation, slips or trips.

Cuando los investigadores de la División de Horas y Salarios del departamento aparecieron en los lugares de trabajo de NBG Logistics Alliance Inc., la empresa sacó a los trabajadores y los escondió durante horas en un restaurante de comida rápida local hasta que los investigadores se fueron. Luego, la empresa ordenó a los empleados que trabajaran al otro lado de la frontera, en Mexicali, antes de despedirlos y borrar pruebas de su empleo de las computadoras. El requerimiento judicial preliminar y la orden judicial del 31 de julio de 2024, por el Tribunal de Distrito de los Estados Unidos para el Distrito Sur de California es consecuencia de una investigación sobre las supuestas violaciones del empleador a la Ley de Normas Justas de Trabajo . La división está investigando si NBG Logistics Alliance pagaba en pesos a los trabajadores de sus depósitos de California a través de una filial con sede en México, Agencia Aduanal Guillermo Nogueira y Asociados S.C. “Repudiablemente, NBG Logistics Alliance obstruyó una investigación federal al ocultar a los trabajadores durante horas fuera del sitio en un restaurante de comida rápida para evitar que hablaran con los investigadores”, explicó el procurador regional occidental Marc Pilotin en San Francisco. “Para obstruir aún más, el empleador y su afiliado con sede en México ordenaron a estos trabajadores que trabajaran en México antes de despedirlos y borrar registros en un esfuerzo por encubrir sus infracciones”. El requerimiento judicial preliminar impide que NBG Logistics Alliance haga lo siguiente: Tomar represalias contra cualquier empleado que se crea que haya hablado con un investigador laboral. Interferir, obstruir o disuadir a cualquier empleado de cooperar en una investigación. Contactar o amenazar con contactar a familiares o amigos para evitar que los trabajadores hablen con los investigadores. Destruir pruebas relacionadas con la investigación. El tribunal también exigió a NBG Logistics Alliance que restaure todos los datos, mensajes y programas eliminados de computadoras y teléfonos celulares que contengan evidencia relacionada con la investigación. “La ley federal protege a los empleados que trabajan en EE.UU., incluso si una entidad fuera del país los contrató. Los empleadores nacionales que emplean conjuntamente a estos trabajadores, como NBG Logistics Alliance, ignoran este principio bajo su propio riesgo”, añadió Pilotin. “El Departamento de Trabajo de EE.UU. responsabilizará a los empleadores cuando infrinjan los derechos de los trabajadores y obstruyan las investigaciones, independientemente de si esos trabajadores regresan a sus hogares al otro lado de la frontera después de la jornada laboral”.

When the investigators with the department’s Wage and Hour Division showed up at NBG Logistics Alliance Inc. worksites, the company removed workers and hid them for hours at a local fast-food restaurant until the investigators left. The company then instructed employees to work across the border in Mexicali before firing them and deleting proof of their employment from computers. The July 31, 2024, injunction and order by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California follows an investigation into the employer’s alleged violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act . The division is investigating whether NBG Logistics Alliance paid workers at its California warehouses in pesos through a Mexico-based affiliate, Agencia Aduanal Guillermo Nogueira y Asociados S.C. “Despicably, NBG Logistics Alliance obstructed a federal investigation by hiding workers for hours off-site at a fast-food restaurant to prevent them from speaking with investigators,” explained Western Regional Solicitor Marc Pilotin in San Francisco. “To obstruct further, the employer and its Mexico-based affiliate instructed these workers to work in Mexico before terminating them and deleting records in an effort to cover-up its violations.” The preliminary injunction stops NBG Logistics Alliance from doing the following: Retaliating against any employee believed to have spoken to a labor investigator. Interfering, obstructing or deterring any employee from cooperating in any investigation. Contacting or threatening to contact family or friends to keep workers from speaking to investigators. Destroying evidence related to the investigation. The court also required NBG Logistics Alliance to restore all data, messages and programs deleted from computers and cell phones that contain evidence related to the investigation. “Federal law protects employees working in the U.S., even if an entity outside the country hired them. Domestic employers that jointly employ such workers, like NBG Logistics Alliance, ignore this principle at their peril,” Pilotin added. “The U.S. Department of Labor will hold employers accountable when they violate workers’ rights and obstruct investigations, regardless of whether those workers return home across the border after the workday.” The action is part of an ongoing enforcement effort to root out abusive labor practices by employers operating in the customs warehouse industry. The division’s San Diego District Office conducted the investigation. The regional Office of the Solicitor in San Francisco is litigating the case.

Resolution: The court agreed that defendants had retaliated against the employee based on protected activity. The court permanently forbid Kwait and the practice from future violations of the Occupational Safety and Health Act’s anti-retaliation provisions and required them to prominently post a notice for employees stating that the employers will not discharge or in any manner discriminate against any employee for engaging in activities protected by section 11(c) of the OSH Act. The court also ordered Kwiat is to pay a contempt fine of $1,250 to the court for discovery violations. The court will hold a hearing on the department’s request that the doctor and the practice pay damages to the terminated worker for all lost wages and benefits resulting from their unlawful firing; reimburse them for costs, expenses, and other pecuniary losses incurred, and compensation for non-economic losses, including emotional distress; and pay exemplary or punitive damages. Court: U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York Docket Number: 1:22-cv-00264 (AMN/DJS) Quotes: “The court’s decision reinforces the Occupational Safety and Health Act’s guarantee that workers have the right to raise safety and health concerns to their employers and file complaints with OSHA and other regulatory agencies without fear of termination and retaliation and the chilling effect such actions have on workers’ coming forward with concerns about health and safety hazards in their workplaces,” said OSHA Regional Administrator Richard Mendelson in New York. “As this case shows, the U.S. Department of Labor will use all enforcement tools available, including litigation, to stop employer conduct that denies workers their legal rights to voice their concerns and file complaints about potential health and safety hazards in their workplace,” said Regional Solicitor of Labor Jeffrey S. Rogoff in New York. Background: The OSHA New York Region’s Whistleblower Protection Program conducted the investigation. Senior Trial Attorney Bertha M. Astorga in the Regional Office of the Solicitor in New York is litigating the case.

President Bill Clinton signed Executive Order 13166 on Aug. 11, 2000, “to improve access to federally conducted and federally assisted programs and activities for persons who, as a result of national origin, are limited in their English proficiency.” In November 2023, the department announced the release of its updated Language Access Plan , which included the establishment of the Centralized Office of Language Assistance in the Department’s Civil Rights Center. The announcement was a response to a 2022 memorandum (link is external) from U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland urging federal agencies to improve communication accessibility, including by revising their language access plans in alignment with Executive Order 13166 (link is external) , “Improving Access to Services for Persons with Limited English Proficiency.” Since the release of the updated Language Access Plan and the establishment of the Centralized Office of Language Assistance, the department has continued to make improvements to communication accessibility, including through the following: Translating vital materials and information into additional languages and developing outreach and engagement strategies for connecting with communities representing individuals with limited English proficiency. Translating Worker.gov , Employer.gov and MigrantWorker.gov into additional languages including Arabic, Simplified Chinese, Haitian Creole, Portuguese, Tagalog and Vietnamese, among other languages. Continuing interpretation services in over 170 languages through the National Contact Center to ensure it responds to individuals in their preferred languages. Providing resources and guidance to the department’s agencies to improve access for non-English speaking workers and those with limited English proficiency. Working with the department’s office and agencies on enhancing their own language access plans tailored to agency missions and programs. The department is dedicated to ensuring our programs, and the programs we fund, remain open to all, regardless of a person’s English proficiency. Together with over 40 federal agencies, the department has prioritized implementing effective policies and procedures to eliminate language barriers to its programs and the programs it funds. In the coming year, the department will continue to engage with its partners on the Federal Language Access Working Group, led by the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division. As a member of the working group, the department will learn and share information about conducting effective language access staff training; recruiting, assessing, hiring, and retaining multilingual staff; contracting for qualified translators and interpreters; and using technology to deliver accurate and reliable language assistance services. Through this unified approach, the department seeks to fulfill the promise of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Executive Order 13166 in preventing discrimination and ensuring equal treatment under the law. Information about the updated Language Access Plan, along with more information about the Civil Rights Center, and its initiatives to support non-English-speaking individuals, can be found on CRC’s website and at LEP.gov (link is external) .

The action comes after a January 2024 follow-up inspection at the facility prompted by Adidas’ failure to submit required proof to the department’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration that the company had installed required guardrails or equivalent protection for employees accessing and working atop a mezzanine, and made certain a ladder used to access the mezzanine extended at least three feet above the landing. OSHA cited the company in March 2022 after its original 2021 inspection found the absence of guardrails and an unsafe ladder exposed Adidas employees to falls of up to 10 feet to the floor below. Inspectors returned in 2024 to find the company had not corrected its violations. “When employers agree to correct a hazard, they must follow through and prove to OSHA that the hazards were addressed,” explained OSHA Area Director Rita Young in Albany, New York. “Adidas America Inc. failed to do so, continued to expose their employees to potentially deadly and disabling injuries and are now liable for additional and sizable OSHA penalties.” View the citation and Failure to Abate notice .
