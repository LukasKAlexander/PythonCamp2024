The franchisee has 19 locations in Palm Beach, Indian River and Brevard counties. ""The restaurant industry employs some of our country's lowest-paid workers who, due to a lack of knowledge of the law, are vulnerable to disparate treatment and labor violations,"" said James Schmidt, acting director of the division's Miami District Office, which conducted the investigation. ""The Wage and Hour Division has an ongoing enforcement initiative in Florida as well as in other states to remedy widespread noncompliance in the restaurant industry. Our goal is to protect workers and ensure a level playing field for honest employers who follow the law and pay their employees fair wages."" Investigators found systemic violations resulting from the company's failure to properly compensate tip-earning employees, such as delivery drivers, for all of their hours worked. Even when performing nontipped duties such as cooking, cleaning and stocking, the workers were paid as if they were tipped employees, with hourly wage rates as low as $5.15 rather than the required federal minimum wage of $7.25. The employer also made illegal deductions from employees' wages for uniforms, and failed to properly calculate and compensate tipped employees for all overtime hours (those worked in excess of 40 in a week). Finally, the employer failed to record and designate hours worked as tipped or nontipped in order to pay employees correctly, which violates the FLSA's record-keeping provisions. Following the investigations, PDQ Pizza paid all back wages owed and agreed to maintain future compliance with the FLSA. The company also committed to changing its timekeeping and payroll practices to ensure that all hours worked by tipped and nontipped employees are properly recorded and compensated in accordance with the FLSA. The FLSA requires that covered, nonexempt employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 for all hours worked, plus time and one-half their regular rates for hours worked beyond 40 per week. In accordance with the FLSA, an employer of a tipped employee is required to pay at least $2.13 an hour in direct wages provided that amount plus the tips received equals at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. If an employee's tips combined with the employer's direct wages does not equal the minimum wage, the employer must make up the difference. Employers also are required to provide employees notice of the FLSA tip credit provisions, to maintain accurate time and payroll records, and to comply with restrictions applying to workers under age 18. Accessible and searchable information on enforcement activities by the Department of Labor is available at http://ogesdw.dol.gov/search. Publicly available enforcement data are available through the free mobile application ""Eat Shop Sleep,"" which enables consumers, employees and other members of the public to check if a hotel, restaurant or retail location has been investigated by the Wage and Hour Division and whether FLSA violations were found. The app is available at https://sites.google.com/site/eatshopsleepdol . The Labor Department has developed a smartphone app to help employees independently track the hours they work and determine the wages they are owed. Available in English and Spanish, users can track regular work hours, break times and any overtime hours for one or more employers.

The goal is to design a tool that demonstrates the importance of recognizing and preventing hazards by helping young people understand their rights in the workplace. Submissions may be designed for Internet browsers, smartphones, feature phones and social media platforms, or as native Windows or Macintosh applications. The deadline is Nov. 30. ""New technologies have the promise of making our safety and health resources even more accessible for workers and employers,"" said Dr. David Michaels, assistant secretary of labor for occupational safety and health. ""Successful proposals could take many different forms, such as interactive and informative games, a smartphone app, social or professional networks, or data visualization."" Each submission should meet both of the following objectives: Demonstrate the importance of knowing about workplace safety and health hazards: Components should be included that inform young workers about hazards in the workplace and the serious consequences of workplace injuries. Information on safety and health from the department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, state workers' compensation programs and/or other government sources must be incorporated. Additional suggested features include those that bring awareness to best management practices, such as engineering controls and personal protection equipment. Help workers understand their rights in the workplace: Components should be included that help young workers understand their rights in the workplace and their employers' responsibility to ensure their health and safety on the job. The content and type of application must be age-appropriate, and should also feature mechanisms for users to interact or share with each other.

"October 17, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20121017,MSHA warns coal mine operators about winter hazards,"ARLINGTON, Va. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration has launched its annual ""Winter Alert"" campaign to call attention to the numerous hazards colder weather typically brings to mining operations around the nation. Statistics show that coal mine explosions occur most often during the colder months, October through March. ""We know this season will bring weather that causes changes in the mining environment and can present certain dangers for working miners,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""We also know that there are precautions mine operators can take to alleviate these hazards and prevent accidents."" Low humidity and low barometric pressures, combined with seasonal drying of many areas in underground coal mines, have been major factors in past mine explosions. Colder weather brings other potential hazards, such as limited visibility, icy haulage roads and walkways, and the freezing and thawing of highwalls at surface mines, which can make them unstable. This winter, MSHA encourages miners and mine operators to understand that ""Prevention is the Key to a Safe Workplace"" by specifying the actions that can prevent serious accidents. MSHA is asking mine operators to ensure that snow and ice in travelways are removed, apply salt and sand where needed, and frequently examine highwalls for stability. In underground coal mines, mine operators should make certain that there is adequate ventilation, apply liberal amounts of rock dust, conduct frequent and thorough examinations, and be familiar with emergency procedures that prevent ignitions and explosions. During regular inspections, MSHA will distribute posters, hardhat stickers and pocket cards with the ""Prevention is the Key to a Safe Workplace"" theme to miners and mine operators throughout the coal industry."
"October 17, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20121017-0,US Labor Department complaint seeks back wages plus damages for underpaid workers at 3 El Rancho Grande restaurants in Ohio,"DAYTON, Ohio — The U.S. Department of Labor has filed a complaint in U.S. district court in Dayton seeking to recover back wages and damages for workers at three El Rancho Grande restaurants in Ohio. An investigation by the department's Wage and Hour Division determined that the restaurants, as well as co-owners Francisco Magana and Juan Hernandez, violated the Fair Labor Standards Act by failing to pay workers proper minimum wage and overtime compensation. Investigators have determined that approximately $285,000 in back wages is owed to 171 workers at Gran Fiesta Inc. in Cincinnati, El Rancho Inc. in Sharonville and WRGRM LCC in Dayton. All three restaurants do business as El Rancho Grande. ""Low-wage workers such as restaurant servers and kitchen staff are far too often taken advantage of because they are reluctant to question employers about their pay and benefits,"" said George Victory, district director of the division in Columbus. ""We are committed to ensuring that all workers receive their rightful wages and benefits."" Investigators found that some kitchen workers were paid a flat rate per week, which amounted to less than the minimum wage per hour, and were not compensated at time and one-half their regular rates for overtime hours worked beyond 40 per week. Additionally, servers' pay fell below the minimum wage due to deductions made for uniforms and because they were not paid for work performed both before and after their scheduled shifts. Workers with limited English skills often performed more uncompensated pre- and post-shift work than other servers. The restaurants also failed to maintain accurate time and payroll records as required. The complaint seeks the restoration of all back wages plus an equal amount in liquidated damages, as well as future compliance with the FLSA's minimum wage, overtime, record-keeping and child labor provisions. When similar wage violations and the falsification of payroll records were disclosed at the same restaurants by a 2002 Wage and Hour Division investigation, the employer agreed to pay more than $100,000 in back wages. The FLSA requires that covered employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 for all hours worked, plus time and one-half their regular rates, including commissions, bonuses and incentive pay, for hours worked beyond 40 per week. Earnings may be determined on a piece-rate, salary, commission or some other basis, but in all such cases the overtime pay due must be computed using the employee's average hourly rate. Employers are also required to maintain accurate time and payroll records. The FLSA also establishes a minimum age of 18 for workers in those nonagricultural occupations that the secretary of labor declares to be particularly hazardous for 16- and 17-year-old workers or detrimental to their health or well-being. Individuals ages 14 and 15 may be employed outside of school hours in a variety of nonmanufacturing and nonhazardous jobs for limited periods of time and under specified conditions. A list of hazardous occupations prohibited for minors is available at http://www.dol.gov/whd/childlabor.htm . Additional information on child labor rules can be found http://www.youthrules.dol.gov/index.htm . The department has created a smartphone application, available at http://www.dol.gov/dol/apps/ , to help employees independently track the hours they work and determine the wages they are owed. Available in English and Spanish, users conveniently can track regular work hours, break times and any overtime hours for one or more employers. This new technology is significant because, instead of relying on their employers' records, workers now can keep their own records.

""Workers in the landscaping industry are among the most vulnerable in the workforce,"" said Cynthia Watson, regional administrator of the Wage and Hour Division in the Southwest. ""The Labor Department is committed to vigorously enforcing the law to ensure that all workers are paid for all hours worked, including any overtime compensation due."" Investigators from the division's Lubbock Area Office found that the employees were paid a fixed, biweekly salary that in many workweeks amounted to less than the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. Turf Specialties failed to compensate employees at time and one-half their regular rates of pay for overtime hours, that is, those worked over 40 in a workweek. Additional minimum wage and overtime violations occurred when the employer made improper deductions from employees' paychecks for uniforms, broken tools and equipment damage. Investigators also found that several employees working as ""crew leaders"" were improperly classified as exempt from the FLSA's overtime provision and consequently denied proper overtime compensation. Turf Specialties, located on East Highway 80, provides residential and commercial landscaping services in the Greater Odessa and Midland areas. The company cooperated with the investigation. In addition to agreeing to pay all back wages due to the affected workers, the company committed to maintaining future compliance with the FLSA by ensuring that employees are properly classified and compensated for all hours worked.

"October 15, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20121015,"MSHA: Mining fatality, injury rates fell to historic low in 2011","ARLINGTON, Va. – Mining fatality and injury rates fell to an all-time low in 2011 according to data recently released from the U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration. The fatal injury rate for mining as a whole was .0114 per 200,000 hours worked, and the all-injury rate was 2.73 per 200,000 hours worked, down from .0234 and 2.81, respectively, in 2010. In the metal/nonmetal mining sector, the fatal injury rate was .0084 per 200,000 hours worked, and the all-injury rate was 2.28 per 200,000 hours worked, down from .0129 and 2.37, respectively, in 2010. In the coal mining sector, the fatal injury rate was .0156 per 200,000 hours worked, and the all-injury rate was 3.38 per 200,000 hours worked, down from .0384 and 3.43, respectively, in 2010. MSHA also released a third-quarter summary of mining deaths across the country. From July through September 2012, 11 deaths occurred in work-related accidents – six in coal mining and five in metal/nonmetal mining. Of the six coal mining deaths, one miner was killed as a result of a machinery accident; two miners were fatally injured as a result of fall of rib, roof, face or back accidents; and three miners were killed in powered haulage accidents. Of the five metal/nonmetal mining deaths, two miners died as a result of falls, one miner died in a machinery accident, one miner lost his life due to falling material, and one miner was killed in a powered haulage accident. ""Even though the mining industry has achieved historic low fatality and injury rates, we know that more needs to be done, and that fatalities and injuries are preventable,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""Many mines operate every shift of every day, year in and year out, without a fatality or a lost-time injury. Fatalities can be prevented through effective safety and health management programs in the workplace. Pre-shift and on-shift examinations can identify and eliminate hazards that kill and injure miners. And providing effective and appropriate training will ensure that miners recognize and understand hazards and how to control or eliminate them."" To identify mines with health and safety problems, MSHA has undertaken a number of outreach and enforcement initiatives such as special impact inspections and ""Rules to Live By,"" a fatality prevention program that highlights the safety and health standards most frequently cited during fatal accident investigations. ""We believe these actions, along with those adopted by the mining industry, can make a positive difference,"" said Main.

The back wages are owed due to violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act's overtime, minimum wage and record-keeping provisions, which were uncovered at all four restaurant locations during investigations by the U.S. Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division. The investigations were conducted under a multiyear enforcement initiative focused on the restaurant industry in South Carolina, where widespread noncompliance with the FLSA has been found. Since the start of fiscal year 2009, the division's Columbia District Office has concluded more than 300 investigations under the initiative, resulting in more than $2.5 million in back wages recovered for more than 2,500 workers. ""We found many low-wage employees working up to 65 hours a week without any overtime compensation and receiving pay below the federal minimum wage. Unfortunately, significant labor violations like the ones we found in this case are all too common in the restaurant industry,"" said Michelle Garvey, director of the division's Columbia office. ""We are pleased that these workers finally will be paid their rightful wages and, as demonstrated by our ongoing initiative, we will continue to investigate South Carolina restaurants to remedy violations and ensure sustained compliance with the law."" At Pancho's Mexican Restaurant I, II and III, investigators found that employees were not properly compensated for all work hours. By reviewing payroll records and conducting employee interviews, investigators determined that tip-earning employees such as servers were made to rely primarily on tips for pay and consequently earned wages that fell below $2.13 per hour in violation of the FLSA's minimum wage provision. Additionally, other employees such as kitchen staff were paid flat salaries each month — without regard to hours worked — that did not satisfy minimum wage or overtime pay requirements. The employer also failed to maintain accurate records of employees' work hours and wages. As a result, 38 employees will receive a total of $414,079 in back wages. The Papa's and Beer Mexican Restaurant investigation revealed that the employer made impermissible deductions for uniforms and other expenses from the wages of tip-earning employees, causing their hourly wages to fall below the federal minimum wage. Additionally, other employees such as kitchen staff were paid flat salaries each month — without regard to hours worked — that did not satisfy minimum wage or overtime pay requirements. The employer also failed to record the hours worked by kitchen staff. As a result, a total of $71,834 in back wages is owed to 47 employees. The restaurants have agreed to maintain future compliance with the FLSA by keeping accurate records of all hours worked by all employees, paying them at least the federal minimum wage, providing overtime compensation, and informing employees in advance that the tip credit will be used. The restaurant industry employs some of the country's lowest-paid workers who, due to a lack of knowledge of the law or unwillingness to exercise their rights, are vulnerable to disparate treatment and labor violations. As in South Carolina, the Wage and Hour Division is conducting other enforcement initiatives throughout the U.S. to identify and remedy violations that are common in the restaurant industry. The FLSA requires that covered, nonexempt employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 for all hours worked, plus time and one-half their regular rates for hours worked beyond 40 per week. In accordance with the FLSA, an employer of a tipped employee is required to pay at least $2.13 an hour in direct wages provided that amount plus tips received equal at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. If an employee's tips combined with the employer's direct wages do not equal the minimum wage, the employer must make up the difference. Employers also are required to provide employees notice of the FLSA tip credit provisions, maintain accurate time and payroll records, and comply with restrictions that apply to workers under age 18.

The funding will be used to promote decent work for domestic workers as part of a broader strategy to address legal, social and economic factors that contribute to the abuse of domestic workers and the exploitation of children in domestic service. It also will support efforts to increase legal protections for domestic workers and increase public awareness about the plight of child domestic workers. Around the world, an estimated 50-100 million people are engaged in domestic work, including more than 15 million children. More than 60 percent of these child domestic laborers — or approximately 9 million children — work in Asia. They often work long hours under dangerous conditions. Many go without pay, receive little or no schooling, face isolation from family and friends, and endure harsh punishments and abuse, all while carrying out physically challenging labor. Applications must be submitted by Nov. 15 at 5 p.m. EST electronically via http://www.grants.gov or as hard copies to the U.S. Department of Labor, Office of Procurement Services, 200 Constitution Ave. NW, Room S-4307, Washington, DC 20210, Attention: Brenda White and James Kinslow. All awards will be made by Dec. 31. The solicitation for grant applications (SGA 12-12) is available online at http://www.dol.gov/ILAB/grants/main.htm and http://www.grants.gov . Congress has appropriated funds for ILAB to conduct technical cooperation projects to combat child labor internationally.

Investigations by the U.S. Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division found violations at 21 day care centers in Colorado, Texas, Georgia, Kansas, New Jersey, Virginia, Ohio and Illinois. Investigators found systemic FLSA violations resulting from the employer's failure to properly compensate overtime hours, that is, those beyond 40 in a workweek. Specifically, the violations include failing to pay employees for time spent at mandatory training courses as well as for work performed prior to or beyond scheduled shift periods. Also, in one instance, employees were hired by the company to teach soccer and tennis at the facility but were misclassified as independent contractors and consequently denied proper compensation. Finally, the employer failed to maintain proper records of employees' work hours and wages. In addition to paying all back wages owed, Crème de la Crème has agreed to comply with the FLSA in the future. ""Child care employees work long hours looking after children's safety, yet are often denied the wages and workplace protections guaranteed by law. We are committed to strengthening compliance in this industry, which is important not just for the workers, but for all the families depending on them for quality child care services,"" said Cynthia Watson, regional administrator for the division in the Southwest. ""We are pleased that these workers finally will be paid their rightful wages and, as demonstrated by our ongoing initiative, will continue to investigate Colorado child care providers to remedy violations and ensure sustained compliance with the law."" The investigations were conducted under a multiyear enforcement initiative focused on the child care industry in Colorado, in which widespread noncompliance with the FLSA has been found. Since 2009, the division's Denver District Office has conducted more than 100 investigations of child care providers in its jurisdiction. Eighty-six percent of all investigated employers were found to be in violation of the FLSA, and the division has recovered approximately $195,000 in back wages owed to more than 800 workers. Child care is a rapidly expanding industry that employs many low-wage, vulnerable workers who, due to a lack of knowledge of the law or unwillingness to exercise their rights, are vulnerable to disparate treatment and labor violations. Enforcement initiatives also are being conducted in Arkansas, Louisiana, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota and Texas. When violations are found, the division is vigorously pursuing corrective action — including payment of back wages, civil money penalties and liquidated damages — to ensure accountability and deter future violations. Due to the severity of violations found throughout this industry, the division is documenting its structure to better target enforcement efforts. As part of the initiatives, the division continues to provide compliance assistance and education to employers and industry associations regarding the requirements of the FLSA and the consequences of violating the law. The division is also conducting outreach to workers, employee associations, community organizations, state licensing agencies and other stakeholders to inform them of the ongoing initiative and encourage participation in promoting compliance. The FLSA requires that covered employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 for all hours worked, plus time and one-half their regular rates, including commissions, bonuses and incentive pay, for hours worked beyond 40 per week. Additionally, employers must maintain accurate time and payroll records. Accessible and searchable information on enforcement activities by the Department of Labor is available at http://ogesdw.dol.gov/search. Publicly available enforcement data are available through the free mobile application ""Eat Shop Sleep,"" which enables consumers, employees and other members of the public to check if a hotel, restaurant or retail location has been investigated by the Wage and Hour Division and whether FLSA violations were found.

"October 9, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20121009,Obama administration announces $20 million for 10 public-private partnerships to support American manufacturing and encourage investment in the US,"Investments will promote job creation and economic growth in local industry clusters in Ariz., Calif., Mich., NY, Okla., Ore., Pa., Tenn. and Wash. WASHINGTON – The Obama administration today announced that 10 public-private partnerships across America will receive $20 million in total awards to help revitalize American manufacturing and encourage companies to invest in the United States. The 10 partnerships were selected through the Advanced Manufacturing Jobs and Innovation Accelerator Challenge, which is a competitive multi-agency grant process announced in May 2012 to support initiatives that strengthen advanced manufacturing at the local level. These public-private partnerships consist of small and large businesses, colleges, nonprofits and other local stakeholders that ""cluster"" in a particular area. The funds will help the winning clusters support local efforts to spur job creation through a variety of projects, including initiatives that connect innovative small suppliers with large companies, link research with the startups that can commercialize new ideas, and train workers with skills that firms need to capitalize on business opportunities. The Advanced Manufacturing Jobs and Innovation Accelerator Challenge is a partnership among the U.S. Department of Commerce's Economic Development Administration and the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Department of Labor's Employment and Training Administration, the U.S. Small Business Administration and the National Science Foundation. In order to create an economy built to last, America needs to make more things the rest of the world wants to buy. After losing millions of good manufacturing jobs in the years before and during the deep recession, the economy has added nearly 500,000 manufacturing jobs since February 2010 – the strongest period of sustained job growth since the 1990s. While there's more work to be done, steps like today's announcement build on this momentum. ""By partnering across the federal government, these grants will help us leverage resources and ensure that training programs for advanced manufacturing careers provide the skills, certifications and credentials that employers want to see from day one,"" Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis said. ""A strong manufacturing base in America is critical to the health of the U.S. economy, and these awards further demonstrate the Obama administration's commitment to keeping this country on the cutting edge of innovation in manufacturing,"" said acting Secretary of Commerce Rebecca Blank. ""This investment will help accelerate and unleash the most promising ideas in advanced manufacturing, and bring those ideas to market. This will lead to good jobs for American workers, increase the nation's competitiveness, and strengthen an economy that's built to last."" The awards will help regional clusters grow by strengthening their connections to regional economic development opportunities and advanced manufacturing assets, helping develop a skilled and diverse advanced manufacturing workforce, increasing exports, encouraging the development of small businesses, and accelerating innovation in technology. The 10 winning initiatives – based in Arizona, California, Michigan, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Washington – will each receive approximately $2 million to fund projects that are expected to train a total of 1,000 workers and help nearly 650 companies leverage a cluster's resources in their regions and create jobs across the country. ""As part of President Obama's blueprint for an economy built to last, the Energy Department is investing in innovative, public-private initiatives like the Advanced Manufacturing Jobs and Innovation Accelerator Challenge that support the pillars of American energy, American manufacturing and skills for American workers,"" said Energy Secretary Steven Chu. ""These investments are helping America strengthen our competitive edge and leadership in the global manufacturing sector."" ""The SBA pioneered the federal government's first regional cluster strategy two years ago, and we've already seen the tangible benefits of these investments, including job creation, innovation and increased competitiveness,"" said SBA Administrator Karen Mills. ""These 10 new advanced manufacturing jobs and innovation accelerators are proof that we can continue to build on – and complement – the success that we've already achieved and support strong ecosystems of small businesses in targeted regions throughout the country and across key industries. Additionally, by supporting our small innovative manufacturing companies, we are fostering the growth of the American supply chain and creating an economy built to last."" As part of President Obama's commitment to creating an economy built to last, the administration has invested more than $200 million promoting regional innovation clusters. The administration created an interagency task force, known as the Taskforce for the Advancement of Regional Innovation Clusters, to develop and administer interagency grant competitions. This is the third round of the Jobs and Innovation Accelerator Challenge and, in addition to the six partnering agencies, this initiative leverages technical assistance from up to eight other federal agencies. The 10 winners announced today are: Arizona: growing the Southern Arizona Aerospace and Defense Region, a project of the Arizona Commerce Authority ($1,817,000). California: Advanced Manufacturing Medical/Biosciences Pipeline for Economic Development, a project of Contra Costa County, Manex, the University of California – Berkeley, Laney College and the Northern California Small Business Development Center at Humboldt State University ($2,190,779).

"October 5, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20121005,Statement of Labor Secretary Hilda L. Solis on September employment numbers,"WASHINGTON – Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis issued the following statement on the September 2012 Employment Situation report released today: ""Our nation's labor market added 114,000 nonfarm payroll jobs in September, while the unemployment rate dropped to 7.8 percent, its lowest level since January 2009. Additionally, 86,000 more Americans found jobs in July and August than had been previously reported. ""The significant drop in the jobless rate was driven by people going back to work, not leaving the labor force. We saw unemployment drop for every group across the board last month. The fastest-growing group of new hires was young people ages 20 to 24 – a very encouraging sign for our country's future. ""Overall, the monthly drop in the unemployment rate is part of a larger trend that has seen the jobless rate fall by 1.2 percent over the last year. ""As many more Americans found work in September, we're also seeing other indications of a strengthening labor market and a quickening recovery. New Unemployment Insurance claims are down to pre-recession levels, consumer confidence is near a five-year high, and the number of people laid off last month was at the lowest level ever reported. ""I'm encouraged by September's growth. It comes even as the worst drought in 25 years placed heavy burdens on our farmers, and Hurricane Isaac disrupted oil and gas production in the Gulf. We've reversed course and achieved a level of stability hard to imagine when the economic crisis began in December 2007. ""New preliminary data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that we've now added nearly 5.2 million private sector jobs over 31 straight months of job growth. That's a striking contrast to the nearly 800,000 jobs a month we were losing at the end of the previous administration. The unemployment rate today is as low as it has been since any time President Obama has been in office. ""President Obama's economic policies are working. It is remarkable to consider the progress we've made despite the relative absence of bipartisan cooperation in Congress. If more lawmakers show a willingness to work across the aisle in the future, I'm confident we can accelerate these gains even more rapidly. The key to our future job growth is to keep tax cuts in place for small businesses and middle-class families, and to make smart investments in infrastructure, energy and job training. That's how we'll build a sustained recovery and create an economy that's truly built to last for the middle class."""

""Ohio's steel industry continues to be in a state of transition,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Employment and Training Jane Oates. ""This federal grant will provide continued re-employment and retraining services so that impacted workers can more effectively compete for new jobs in growing local industries."" In October 2010, a National Emergency Grant was awarded to the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services for up to $984,248, with $492,124 released initially. At the time of the award, the facilities were owned by the steel manufacturer Severstal; they were later purchased by RG Steel. An increment of $41,347 was awarded in June 2012, and today's increment completes the total amount of funding awarded. The funding will provide training and support services to eligible workers currently being served by this grant, along with additional workers affected by layoffs resulting from RG Steel's Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Many of the workers receiving services under this grant also are eligible for Trade Adjustment Assistance. The grant funds will provide those workers with continued access to supportive services not available through the TAA program, and those workers who are not TAA-eligible will be given access to an array of training and employment-related services.

""Guarding Machinery at Metal & Nonmetal Mines"" is a sequel to a compliance guide for guarding conveyor belts published in 2010. In that year, guarding-related violations peaked at 10,877 and accounted for one of every seven violations cited. ""The purpose of this new guide designed to improve mine safety is threefold: to improve the mining industry's understanding of good guarding principles; ensure the construction, installation and maintenance of high-quality, effective guards; and improve compliance, inspection and enforcement consistency,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Mine Safety and Health Joseph A. Main. According to Parts 56/57.14107 of 30 Code of Federal Regulations, moving machine parts must be guarded to protect individuals from contacting gears; sprockets; chains; drive, head, tail and take-up pulleys; flywheels; couplings; shafts; fan blades; and similar moving parts that can cause injury. Guards are not required when the exposed moving parts are at least 7 feet away from walking or working surfaces. Injuries related to equipment guarding typically occur because guards are missing, inadequately sized or positioned, and also may be due to miners handling or dropping heavy, unwieldy and other poorly designed, constructed or maintained guards. For example, in some cases, lacerations or other injuries may occur due to a guard's construction. The new guide, available at http://www.msha.gov , has been widely reviewed by industry stakeholders, MSHA inspectors and MSHA supervisors. It provides examples of good guarding practice and compliance information relating to all types of mining equipment, including drive and power transmission components; crushers and screens; rotating, packaging and palletizing equipment; power tools and auxiliary equipment. The conveyor belt guarding guide was well received by the mining industry and has resulted in increased compliance and more consistent enforcement. Guarding-related citations and orders issued through the third quarter of fiscal year 2012 are down 39 percent from 2010 levels. Both guides have the same format: a photo-illustrated PowerPoint presentation with detailed explanatory notes. ""Both are valuable guarding compliance resources for miners, mine operators, miners' representatives, independent contractors, equipment manufacturers and MSHA enforcement personnel,"" said Main. The most recent mining fatality that involved improper guarding practices occurred in August 2011 at 4 J's Gravel Crushing Plant 2 in Renville County, Minn. A 24-year-old equipment operator was killed when he became entangled in a feed belt conveyor's head pulley components. MSHA determined that mine management failed to ensure that moving machine parts were guarded to protect miners from coming into contact with them."

"October 2, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20121002,US Department of Labors OSHA announces alternative dispute resolution pilot program for whistleblower complaints,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration is launching an alternative dispute resolution pilot program for complaints filed with OSHA's Whistleblower Protection Program. ADR can assist complainants and employers in resolving their disputes in a cooperative and voluntary manner. The program will be implemented in two OSHA regions and offer two voluntary methods of ADR: early resolution and mediation. When a whistleblower complaint is filed with OSHA in one of the pilot regions, the parties will be notified of their ADR options and may work through an OSHA regional ADR coordinator to use these methods. ""OSHA is committed to fair, effective and timely enforcement of the whistleblower laws delegated to us by Congress,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health Dr. David Michaels. ""Alternative dispute resolution can provide immediate relief and finality to both parties."" The two OSHA regions that will participate in the pilot are headquartered in Chicago and San Francisco. The Chicago Regional Office is responsible for whistleblower investigations filed with federal OSHA in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Ohio. The San Francisco Regional Office is responsible for whistleblower investigations filed with federal OSHA in Arizona, California, Hawaii and Nevada, as well as various Pacific Islands including the commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam and American Samoa. OSHA administers the whistleblower provisions of 22 statutes. All of these laws cover millions of public and private sector employees in health care, food, finance, air travel, pipeline, transit, rail and other industries. OSHA receives approximately 2,500 whistleblower complaints annually. Information on the pilot program can be viewed at http://s.dol.gov/WV. Additional information on OSHA's whistleblower program is available at http://www.whistleblowers.gov . Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. OSHA's role is to ensure these conditions for America's working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education and assistance.

The pilot training program began Sept. 24 and will continue through Oct. 5 at the National Mine Health and Safety Academy in Beaver, W.Va. The training covers securing an accident scene, photographing and sketching, collecting and packaging evidence, conducting interviews, dealing with false or altered records, and releasing the scene. ""This training will help improve MSHA investigators' skills and knowledge to conduct investigations under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 – including willful violations of the Mine Act – as well as accident investigations,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""In the event an accident investigation identifies possible criminal activities, MSHA's investigators will be better prepared to interact with the Department of Justice."" ""MSHA's accident investigation team has a very difficult and challenging job,"" said FBI Laboratory Director D. Christian Hassell. ""Its commitment to ensuring the integrity of the evidence, collected during the course of their investigations, is commendable. The FBI is pleased to work with this group of dedicated professionals, and we look forward to continuing our partnership with MSHA as the agency enhances its training program."" The minimum requirements to become a special investigator include being an authorized representative of the secretary of labor with authority to conduct inspections or having the authorization for right of entry to mining operations, as well as the completion of five weeks of formal classroom training. Credentials also may be obtained through an on-the-job training program. A lead accident investigator must be an authorized representative and is required to complete 21 weeks of classroom training at the academy, combined with extensive field training and evaluation."
"October 2, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20121002,US Labor Department sues to recover losses suffered by participants in employee stock ownership plan of Calif.-based Sierra Aluminum,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor has filed a lawsuit against GreatBanc Trust Co. and Sierra Aluminum Co. in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, based on an investigation by the department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration. The suit alleges that GreatBanc violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act by breaching its fiduciary duties to the Sierra Aluminum Employee Stock Ownership Plan when it allowed the plan to pay more than fair market value for employer stock in June 2006. The suit names Sierra Aluminum, the ESOP’s sponsor, as a defendant for entering into an indemnification agreement with GreatBanc that violates ERISA. “Plan fiduciaries have an obligation to work solely in the interest of plan participants,” said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Employee Benefits Security Phyllis C. Borzi. “When they fail to do so, the retirement security of workers is put in jeopardy, and we will take action to make plan participants whole.” The suit alleges that GreatBanc failed to adequately inquire into an appraiser’s report that presented unrealistic and aggressively optimistic projections of Sierra Aluminum’s future earnings and profitability. GreatBanc allegedly failed to investigate the credibility of the assumptions, factual bases and adjustments to financial statements that the appraiser relied upon in preparing its report. The suit also alleges that GreatBanc asked the appraiser to revise its valuation opinion in order to reconcile the ESOP’s higher purchase price with the lower fair market value of the company stock. The suit further alleges that Sierra Aluminum’s indemnification agreement with GreatBanc violated ERISA to the extent that it would permit Sierra Aluminum to pay GreatBanc’s losses, costs, expenses and damages unless and until a court enters an unappealable judgment that GreatBanc did not violate ERISA. The complaint seeks to restore losses plus interest to the plan and to enjoin Sierra Aluminum from indemnifying GreatBanc. Sierra Aluminum Co.’s principal place of business is in Riverside, Calif. The company produces extruded aluminum products for use in various industries such as construction and transportation. GreatBanc Trust Co. is based in Lisle, Ill. The ESOP currently has 322 participants. EBSA’s Los Angeles Regional Office conducted the investigation that resulted in the suit. The case is being litigated by the department’s Office of the Solicitor in Washington, D.C.

"September 28, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ofccp/ofccp20120928,"US Labor Department settles lawsuit with Nash Finch for $188,500","Minnesota-based food distributor to pay back wages to 84 women — and provide job offers — to settle allegations of sex discrimination at North Carolina facility LUMBERTON, N.C. — The U.S. Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs has reached an agreement with federal contractor Nash Finch Co. to settle allegations of hiring discrimination against female job applicants at the company's distribution facility in Lumberton. In consent findings approved by the department's Office of Administrative Law Judges, Nash Finch Co. has agreed to pay $188,500 in back wages and interest to 84 women who were rejected for the entry-level position of order selector at the company's distribution facility in Lumberton. ""I am glad we were able to achieve a fair resolution in this case,"" said Solicitor of Labor M. Patricia Smith. ""Our economy cannot afford to lose the skills and talents of millions of American women who count on us to enforce equal opportunity laws so that they can find good jobs without fear of discrimination."" OFCCP investigators conducted a review of Nash Finch's employment practices at the Lumberton facility from May 1, 2005, to Dec. 31, 2006. Based on their findings, the agency asserted that Nash Finch had failed to ensure qualified female job applicants received equal consideration for employment without regard to sex as required by Executive Order 11246. OFCCP filed a complaint with the Labor Department's Office of Administrative Law Judges on Nov. 30, 2010, alleging that Nash Finch systematically had discriminated against women who applied for jobs as order selectors during a nine-month period in 2006. ""Our government relies on thousands of private companies to produce the goods and provide the services that we depend on to do our jobs,"" said OFCCP Director Patricia A. Shiu. ""It is in everyone's best interest that contractors like Nash Finch succeed. But, for federal contractors, success is not measured solely by performing a task or providing a service. True success means that, as required by law, every qualified worker has a fair shot at jobs funded by taxpayer dollars."" In addition to the financial remedies, the settlement requires Nash Finch to extend job offers to up to 12 women in the original class as order selector positions become available. The company must also submit progress reports to OFCCP for the next two years. Women who applied and were rejected for order selector positions at Nash Finch's Lumberton facility between March 1 and Dec. 31, 2006, may be eligible for the back wages, interest and job opportunities in this settlement. The company will attempt to contact all class members to explain their eligibility for these remedies. However, anyone who does not receive such a notice and believes the omission is an error can contact OFCCP's toll-free helpline at 800-397-6251 (TTY: 877-889-5627) for more information. Nash Finch is based in Minneapolis and is the second-largest publicly traded wholesale food distributor in the nation. The company distributes food products to military commissaries around the world. Since the start of the OFCCP review period on May 1, 2005, Nash Finch has received payments of more than $14 million from the U.S. Department of Defense. In addition to Executive Order 11246, OFCCP enforces Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act Of 1974. As amended, these three laws require those who do business with the federal government, both contractors and subcontractors, to follow the fair and reasonable standard that they not discriminate in employment on the basis of sex, race, color, religion, national origin, disability or status as a protected veteran.

A notice about the new process is in the Sept. 28 edition of the Federal Register, which can be viewed at http://s.dol.gov/WT. ""The labor certification process plays a crucial role in ensuring that employers have access to temporary foreign workers when needed, without adversely affecting U.S. workers,"" said Jane Oates, assistant secretary of labor for employment and training. ""This new streamlined process will increase the accessibility and quality of our services, promote greater transparency, and make it even easier for small businesses to collect the data they need to meet program reporting requirements."" H-2A and H-2B program modules will be integrated in the existing iCERT Visa Portal System managed by the Employment and Training Administration's Office of Foreign Labor Certification. Key features include online account management, which will enable employers to manage client membership lists; the ability to prepare, submit, and track H-2A and H-2B applications; and the option to reuse applications from previous seasons, thereby reducing data entry time. Real-time electronic form validations will warn users of missing data entries, helping them avoid application processing delays, and email notifications will keep users informed throughout the application process. In addition, the paperless submission process will significantly reduce administrative time and costs by enabling users to upload supporting documents for more efficient storage and retrieval. Electronic filing for the H-2B program is scheduled to be implemented on Oct. 15, and electronic filing for the H-2A program is scheduled to be implemented on Dec. 10. The H-2A and H-2B programs establish a means for U.S. employers to hire foreign workers on a temporary basis when qualified U.S. workers are not available, and the employment of those foreign workers will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of U.S. workers.

"September 27, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20120927,"US Department of Labor boosts Unemployment Insurance program integrity, performance and system improvement projects","30 states, District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands receive funding WASHINGTON, D.C. – The U.S. Department of Labor today announced grants to 30 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands for Unemployment Insurance program integrity, performance and system improvement projects. The grants will support the integrity of the UI program through the prevention, detection and recovery of improper UI benefit payments by assisting states in addressing the core root causes of UI improper payments, updating information technology system infrastructures, and expanding their use of re-employment and eligibility assessments, which have been shown to be an effective strategy for reducing improper payments. ""Unemployment Insurance is a critical lifeline for people who lose their jobs through no fault of their own, and the Department of Labor is responsible for safeguarding the program so that it remains available to those who need it,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""This funding will help ensure that state UI programs run efficiently and effectively for the long term."" Activities supported through today's awards of a total of $169.9 million include conducting cross-matching with the National Directory of New Hires to prevent UI payments to re-employed claimants; implementing the State Information Data Exchange System and related messaging tools to target improper payments of those moving across state lines; and implementing the Treasury Offset Program administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, which allows offsetting UI overpayments with federal income tax returns. Additionally, three grants are being awarded to consortia in multiple states for projects designed to improve overall program quality, accountability, performance and integrity. The consortia approach minimizes the cost of multiple states implementing expensive system redesigns while achieving important program integrity functionality. Since 2009, the department has funded three consortia involving 11 states. This new investment will fund an additional three state consortia involving nine states. Consortia grants will be used to design and implement UI tax and/or benefit systems and implement technology-based tools designed to prevent, detect or collect and recover improper UI payments. Under the terms of the grant, the systems and tools must be open-source, allowing all states to benefit from them. Past consortia grants have resulted in new software solutions that incorporate important integrity functions, such as improved cross-matching, and the integration of Separation Information Data Exchange Systems to facilitate improved communication between states and employers regarding individual eligibility. Finally, eight states are receiving funds to expand their use of re-employment and eligibility assessments. In-person assessments include the development of a re-employment plan for claimants; the provision of labor market information that is appropriate to the claimants' locations and employment prospects; a complete review of claimants' eligibility for UI benefits; and a referral to re-employment services and/or training separate from the UI program. Research has shown that re-employment and eligibility assessments are effective at reducing improper payments and saving money in the UI system. These integrity investments will work in conjunction with other strategies being utilized to hold states accountable for improved prevention, detection and recovery of improper payments, including newly required annual reporting on state actions to address improper payments, new state performance measures, and quarterly tracking of state implementation of core strategies and individual state improper payment data. Individual state improper payment data can be viewed at http://www.dol.gov/dol/maps/map-ipia.htm . Editor's note: A complete list of funds awarded follows this release.

The competition, which is being funded by the U.S. Department of Commerce's Economic Development Administration and National Institute of Standards and Technology Manufacturing Extension Partnership and the U.S. Department of Labor's Employment and Training Administration, will build upon the administration's bottom-up approach to strengthening the economy and creating jobs by partnering with state, regional and local economies. ""More and more businesses are choosing to invest, create jobs and make things here in America, and this new initiative represents the latest effort by the Obama administration to build on that trend,"" said acting Secretary of Commerce Rebecca Blank. ""This administration's top priority is creating American jobs, and through the Make it in AmericaChallenge, we will be supporting businesses' efforts to expand here at home. By making competitive investments, the challenge will help communities across the U.S. accelerate economic growth, attract business investment and create jobs."" ""The modern global manufacturing landscape has changed the way companies do business, but it has also changed the way companies do training,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""This initiative will provide comprehensive assistance to those companies and those communities committed to 'make it in America' through innovative training programs that lead to industry-recognized credentials and arm our workforce with the skills employers want to see from day one."" Today's announcement builds on the administration's efforts to encourage companies – large and small, foreign and domestic, manufacturers and services firms – to increase investment in the United States. The president's plan includes eliminating tax incentives for companies that ship jobs overseas and providing tax credits for companies that bring jobs back, investing in American workers to ensure they have the skills they need, modernizing our infrastructure and taking action to ensure that American businesses and workers are competing on a level playing field. The national competition announced today will help provide the critical infrastructure, strategic planning, capacity building, technical assistance and workforce skills training necessary for American communities to be the desired home for more businesses. The challenge is expected to give out approximately 15 awards, depending on the number of eligible applications. To be eligible for an award, projects must encourage insourcing through onshoring of productive activity by U.S. firms, fostering increased foreign direct investment or incentivizing U.S. companies to keep their businesses and jobs here at home, as well as train local workers to meet the needs of those businesses. A federal funding opportunity will be published by early 2013, which will provide detailed guidelines for submitting an application, including the deadline."

The monthly inspections, which began in force in April 2010 following the explosion at the Upper Big Branch Mine, involve mines that merit increased agency attention and enforcement due to their poor compliance history or particular compliance concerns, including high numbers of violations or closure orders; frequent hazard complaints or hotline calls; plan compliance issues; inadequate workplace examinations; a high number of accidents, injuries or illnesses; fatalities; and adverse conditions such as increased methane liberation, faulty roof conditions and inadequate ventilation. As an example from last month, an impact inspection was conducted on Aug. 8 at D & C Mining Corp. in Harlan County, Ky. MSHA personnel captured and monitored the communication systems to prevent advance notification of the inspection. They issued five 104(d)(2) unwarrantable failure orders, one 104(b) withdrawal order and 10 citations, six of which were deemed significant and substantial. The 104(d)(2) orders were issued for an improperly conducted pre-shift examination, an accumulation of combustible materials, a failure to comply with mine emergency evacuation training and drills, a failure on the part of the section foreman and another miner to wear a self-contained self-rescuer device, and a failure by the section foreman to perform the required daily calibration test of multi-gas detectors. Among the significant and substantial violations were a failure to comply with the roof control plan, an accumulation of combustible materials, damaged areas in the power cord of a battery charger and misaligned conveyer belts. This impact inspection was the mine's 10th since April 2010. Additionally, the mine received letters from MSHA notifying it of a potential pattern of violation in 2007 and 2008. Last March, the Labor Department filed a complaint against D & C Mining in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky, alleging that the company owes $1.67 million of $2.7 million assessed in civil penalties for 1,244 violations cited between Jan. 24, 2006, and Feb. 8, 2012. After D & C failed to respond to the complaint, the department filed a motion for entry of judgment by default on July 10 along with a proposed judgment. The motion requests payment of the principal owed, penalties and interest; an order preventing D & C from ""violating or failing or refusing to comply with any final orders"" by failing to pay already delinquent penalties and future penalties; for D & C to post a bond to ensure the payment of future penalties; and an order that D & C keep all property in which it has an ownership interest on site at the mine and not sell or move the property. ""Sadly, D & C Mining still hasn't gotten the message,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""Operators who continue to ignore sound safety and health practices and fail to pay fines for assessed violations will be subject to the toughest enforcement actions allowed under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977."" Since April 2010, MSHA has conducted 492 impact inspections and issued 8,800 citations, 865 orders and 38 safeguards.

The company and Quach have agreed to pay more than $70,000 owed to 10 current and former kitchen staff and servers. ""The Labor Department holds employers accountable when they do not properly pay their workers and when they endanger the safety of minors by employing them to perform hazardous work,"" said Cynthia Watson, regional administrator for the Wage and Hour Division in the Southwest. ""In this case, the employer took advantage of low-wage, vulnerable workers who were unaware of their rights provided by the FLSA. The department remains committed to protecting workers and law-abiding employers by ensuring that competitors who ignore their legal obligations do not gain a competitive advantage."" Investigators found that employees who worked up to 65 hours per week were paid fixed salaries that failed to meet the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, and did not include overtime pay at time and one-half employees' regular rates for hours worked over 40 in a week. It was also determined that the company hired a 16-year-old to operate, disassemble and clean a power-driven meat slicer in violation of an FLSA child labor prohibition. The FLSA establishes a minimum age of 18 for workers in those nonagricultural occupations that the secretary of labor has declared to be particularly hazardous for 16- and 17-year-old workers or detrimental to their health or well-being. A list of hazardous occupations prohibited for minors is available on the Wage and Hour Division's website at http://www.dol.gov/elaws/esa/flsa/docs/haznonag.asp . Hazardous Occupation Order No. 10 specifically prohibits workers under the age of 18 from operating power-driven meat-processing machinery. Additional information on child labor rules can be found at http://www.youthrules.dol.gov/index.htm . The FLSA requires that covered employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 for all hours worked, plus time and one-half their regular rates, including commissions, bonuses and incentive pay, for hours worked beyond 40 per week. Simply paying employees a salary does not exempt them from overtime protections. In general, ""hours worked"" includes all time an employee must be on duty, or on the employer's premises or at any other prescribed place of work, from the beginning of the first principal work activity to the end of the last principal activity of the workday. Additionally, the law requires that accurate records of employees' wages, hours and other conditions of employment be maintained.

"September 20, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20120920,Statement by Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis on fatal occupational injuries in 2011,"WASHINGTON – Preliminary results from the Bureau of Labor Statistics' National Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries were released today. Findings show that the number of fatal work injuries in 2011 was slightly lower than final results from 2010. Last year, 4,609 workers died from work-related injuries, down from a final count of 4,690 in 2010. Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis issued the following statement in response to the census: ""Today's report shows a decline in the number of workplace fatalities. It's a step in the right direction, but more needs to be done. We will continue to collaborate with employers, workers, labor leaders, and safety and health professionals to ensure that every American who clocks in for a shift can make it home safe and sound at the end of the day. ""On average, 13 workers lose their lives each and every day, and that loss ripples throughout their communities. Children, parents, brothers, sisters and neighbors all bear an enormous burden when a loved one dies on the job. ""It's clear that we must maintain our commitment to ensuring our workplaces are safer and healthier for every American. This is a challenge that must be undertaken not just by the government but by the entire country. We know how to prevent these fatalities, and all employers must take the steps necessary to keep their workers safe. ""At the Labor Department, we take these challenges very seriously. Each and every one of us is committed to doing what we can so that every worker can return home at the end of the day in the same condition he or she left. The workers of our nation deserve nothing less."""

The initiative is jointly funded and administered by the department's Employment and Training Administration and its Office of Disability Employment Policy. ""This program represents our strong commitment to assisting people with disabilities in securing good jobs and providing career pathways,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""These Employment and Training Administration grants will expand the capacity of the public workforce system to provide training and employment services to people with disabilities."" This round of funding is the third under the Disability Employment Initiative, which currently supports 16 state projects. The new grants are being awarded to Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Minnesota and Rhode Island, and will implement exemplary employment services for individuals with disabilities in the public workforce system. The states with continuing grants under the initiative are Alaska, Arkansas, California, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Kansas, Maine, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, South Dakota, Tennessee, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin. All projects under this initiative build upon previous department initiatives by hiring staff with expertise in disability and workforce issues. The grants support extensive collaboration across multiple workforce and disability service systems in each state, including vocational rehabilitation, mental health, intellectual/developmental disability agencies, independent living centers, business leadership networks, and other community and nonprofit organizations. ""Everyone should have the opportunity to contribute to today's workforce,"" said Kathy Martinez, assistant secretary of labor for disability employment policy. ""Enhancing the workforce system's ability to provide effective coordinated and collaborative service delivery will help to ensure that people with disabilities have access to the employment training and supports they need to achieve self-sufficiency."" The department's priority is to serve individuals with disabilities and those who are receiving Social Security disability benefits, and it is working on early intervention strategies to assist people with disabilities before they become disability beneficiaries. The Disability Employment Initiative expands the public workforce system's participation in the Social Security Administration's Ticket to Work Program by requiring participating state workforce agencies or local workforce investment boards to become active employment networks. Many Supplemental Security Income and Social Security Disability Insurance beneficiaries use the mainstream workforce system to seek employment opportunities.

LOOKOUT, W.Va. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration has cited Roger Shortridge Construction, based in Mt. Lookout, for one willful and two serious violations at a Tridelphia work site. OSHA initiated an investigation in March after a compliance officer observed fall hazards while conducting an inspection of another contractor at the work site. Proposed penalties total $47,400. The willful violation is failing to ensure that employees use fall protection when working on a steep roof. A willful violation is one committed with intentional knowledge or voluntary disregard for the law's requirements, or with plain indifference to worker safety and health. The citation carries a $42,000 penalty. The serious violations involve failing to initiate and maintain a safety and health program, as well as to ensure the use of eye protection.

The grants are part of the Trade Adjustment Assistance Community College and Career Training initiative, which promotes skills development and employment opportunities in fields such as advanced manufacturing, transportation and health care, as well as science, technology, engineering and math careers through partnerships between training providers and local employers. The U.S. Department of Labor is implementing and administering the program in coordination with the U.S. Department of Education. Speaking in Florida at St. Petersburg College, which is receiving $15 million in funds to lead a consortium of community colleges across the state in developing programs focused on advanced manufacturing, Secretary Solis said: ""These federal grants are part of the Obama administration's ongoing commitment to strengthening American businesses by strengthening the American workforce. This strategic investment will enhance ties among community colleges, universities, employers and other local partners while ensuring that students have access to the skills and resources they need to compete for high-wage, high-skill careers."" The initiative complements President Obama's broader goals to help ensure that every American has at least one year of postsecondary education and the U.S. has the highest proportion of college graduates in the world by 2020.

The investigation was initiated after a worker with the masonry contractor was injured by falling from a sixth floor balcony while attempting to access a suspension scaffold. Proposed penalties total $136,290. The willful violation reflects the use of makeshift devices on top of scaffolds to increase the level height for working and a failure to protect workers on scaffolds from fall hazards. A willful violation is one committed with intentional knowledge or voluntary disregard for the law's requirements, or with plain indifference to worker safety and health. Two repeat violations involve unprotected workers on scaffolds and a sixth floor balcony. A repeat violation exists when an employer previously has been cited for the same or a similar violation of a standard, regulation, rule or order at any other facility in federal enforcement states within the last five years. The same violations were cited in 2007 and 2010. Four serious violations involve a failure to install cross bracing on the entire scaffold, ensure personal fall arrest systems were attached to a secure anchorage point and not scaffold guard rails, train workers to recognize and avoid hazards including falls, and ensure proper step ladder use. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known. ""Fall hazards are a leading cause of death in the construction industry, and therefore it is critical that employers provide workers with proper fall protection,"" said Kris Hoffman, director of OSHA's Parsippany Area Office. ""Employers are responsible for ensuring safe and healthful workplaces, and will be held legally accountable when they fail to do so."" The company has 15 business days from receipt of the citations to comply, request an informal conference with the OSHA area director, or contest the citations and proposed penalties before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. In April, Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis announced a campaign to provide employers and workers with life-saving information and educational materials about working safely from ladders, scaffolds and roofs in an effort to prevent deadly falls in the construction industry. In 2010, more than 10,000 construction workers were injured as a result of falling while working from heights, and more than 250 workers were killed. OSHA's fall prevention campaign was developed in partnership with the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health and NIOSH's National Occupational Research Agenda program.

OSHA initiated an inspection in June as part of the agency's Local Emphasis Program on Falls in Construction. The violations involve failing to ensure workers were using fall protection when engaged in residential construction, trained to recognize fall hazards and did not access work areas when using a ladder that did not extend above the landing surface at least 3 feet. Additionally, the company did not train workers on proper construction use, placement and care of ladders. Proposed penalties total $84,700. A repeat violation exists when an employer previously has been cited for the same or a similar violation of a standard, regulation, rule or order at any facility in federal enforcement states within the last five years. Similar violations were cited at a company work site in Suwanee in May 2012. ""Falls continue to be a leading cause of workplace fatalities in the construction industry,"" said Bill Fulcher, director of OSHA's Atlanta-East Area Office.

"September 19, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20120919,Employee Benefits Security Administration announces launch of 401(k) fee disclosure resource website,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor’s Employee Benefits Security Administration has announced a new 401(k) fee disclosure website as a resource for consumers. The new site, www.dol.gov/ebsa-copy/publications/understandingretirementfees.html, offers information on disclosures that, for the first time, will help workers with 401(k)-type retirement plans see what they are paying to invest their savings. It also includes new tips and tools on making smart retirement investment decisions. “Workers deserve to know how much they are paying for their retirement investments. These disclosures will help workers get the most for their money when it comes to their 401(k)-type retirement plans,” said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Employee Benefits Security Phyllis C. Borzi. “Fees can eat away at retirement savings. Access to good information can lead to an increase of tens – even hundreds-of-thousands of dollars – in retirement savings over the course of a career.” As a result of a rule published by EBSA, workers investing in 401(k)-type plans began receiving fee disclosures from their employers this summer, marking the first time that employers have been required to provide this information. Research has shown that paying just 1 percent more in fees can lead to a 28 percent decrease in a 401(k) account balance over the course of a career. The launch of the new site follows a webinar featuring Gene Sperling, director of the National Economic Council and assistant to the president for economic policy; Hilda L. Solis, secretary of labor; and Borzi that offered advice on how to utilize the new disclosures. A recording of the webinar is available at http://s.dol.gov/WM. A transcript will be available soon. Workers in employer-sponsored health and retirement benefit plans who have questions about benefits laws can contact an EBSA benefits advisor at www.askebsa.dol.gov or by calling 866-444-EBSA (3272).

This grant will provide aid to affected communities across 37 counties throughout the state. ""This summer's storms inflicted incredible damage across Ohio,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""The federal funding announced today will assist with the clean-up of streambeds and waterways that are critical in preventing future flooding and subsequent damage to public infrastructure."" These funds are being awarded to the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services and will be used to create temporary jobs to assist in recovery efforts. On Aug. 20, the Federal Emergency Management Agency declared a total of 37 Ohio counties eligible for FEMA's Public Assistance Program, following the severe storms and straight-line wind event. This grant will provide assistance for all of those counties: Adams, Allen, Athens, Auglaize, Belmont, Champaign, Clark, Coshocton, Fairfield, Franklin, Gallia, Guernsey, Hancock, Hardin, Harrison, Highland, Hocking, Jackson, Knox, Lawrence, Licking, Logan, Meigs, Miami, Monroe, Morgan, Morrow, Muskingum, Noble, Paulding, Perry, Pickaway, Pike, Putnam, Shelby, Van Wert, and Washington.

Under a consent judgment approved by a Labor Department administrative law judge, Meyer Tool will pay $325,000 in back wages and interest to 60 qualified African-American applicants who were rejected for entry-level machinist positions at the company's manufacturing plant in Cincinnati. Meyer Tool also will extend job offers to at least 11 members of the original class as positions become available. ""Workers should never be denied a fair shot at employment because of factors that have absolutely nothing to do with their ability to do the job,"" said OFCCP Director Patricia A. Shiu. ""I am pleased that we were able to reach a fair settlement with Meyer Tool — one that will provide remedies to the affected workers and guarantee that, going forward, qualified applicants of all races and backgrounds will have the opportunity to compete on a level playing field for good jobs."" Based on a compliance review of the facility, OFCCP investigators determined that Meyer Tool had failed to ensure qualified job applicants received equal consideration for employment without regard to race as required by Executive Order 11246. The department filed an administrative complaint on Nov. 19, 2010, alleging systematic discrimination on the part of the company. Under the terms of the consent judgment, Meyer Tool not only will provide financial remedies and job offers to the affected workers, but also will maintain employment records as required by law, provide equal employment opportunity training to all employees involved in the hiring process and submit detailed progress reports on this front to OFCCP for the next two years. Cincinnati-based Meyer Tool manufactures engine parts, primarily for the aerospace industry, and is one of the area's largest private companies. During the period of OFCCP's review, Meyer Tool held contracts worth nearly $300,000 to provide engines and engine parts to the U.S. Army. In addition to Executive Order 11246, OFCCP enforces Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974. As amended, these three laws require those who do business with the federal government, both contractors and subcontractors, to follow the fair and reasonable standard that they not discriminate in employment on the basis of sex, race, color, religion, national origin, disability or status as a protected veteran.

The online filing tool will better assist plan sponsors who file electronically by ensuring that all required information is submitted, and providing immediate confirmation that notices have been received by the department. “The revised submission procedures should provide plan sponsors a greater level of confidence that their requests for fiduciary relief have been received and will be efficiently processed and reviewed,” said Assistant Secretary of Labor for EBSA Phyllis C. Borzi. “The easy-to-use online filing system guides plan sponsors through the information that must be submitted, and allows us to more quickly process and respond to their requests. We’ve also retained flexibility for those plan sponsors who choose to submit paper notices.” The final service provider-to-plan sponsor fee disclosure rule, referred to as the 408(b)(2) regulation for the relevant section in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, became effective on July 1, 2012. It includes a provision to protect plan sponsors, or other responsible plan fiduciaries, from liability for a breach of their fiduciary duties under ERISA when, without the plan sponsor’s knowledge, a service provider fails to comply with the rule’s comprehensive disclosure requirements. If a plan sponsor discovers that required information has not been furnished, and efforts to obtain the information are not successful, the sponsor must notify the department, by regular mail or electronically. Electronic notices now can be filed online at: www.dol.gov/ebsa/regs/feedisclosurefailurenotice.html . Plan sponsors who want to send paper notices can now submit them to a dedicated P.O. box address, rather than to the department’s general mailing address. Notices can be addressed to: U.S. Department of Labor, Employee Benefits Security Administration, Office of Enforcement, P.O. Box 75296, Washington, D.C. 20013. The department initially published the revised procedures as proposed improvements on July 16, 2012, and invited public comment through August 15, 2012 (77 FR 41678). During that time, no comments were received. Accordingly, because no significant adverse comment was received, the revised procedures automatically became effective on September 14, 2012.

"September 13, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20120913,Statement by Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis on 18th anniversary of Violence Against Women Act,"WASHINGTON – Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis today issued the following statement to mark the 18th anniversary of passage of the landmark Violence Against Women Act: ""This month, we mark the historic passage of VAWA by redoubling our commitment to a zero tolerance policy against this heinous crime and our efforts to help victims rebuild their lives. ""Intimate partner violence is the number one cause of family homelessness in America. It puts our young women in danger of long-term physical and emotional harm. And it puts their children at greater risk of substance abuse, emotional disorders and becoming abusers themselves later in life. We've made great strides in increasing public awareness about this epidemic, but more work needs to be done. Today, we're asking all Americans to play a role in stopping domestic violence against women when they see it by calling 800-799-SAFE or visiting http://www.TheHotLine.org . ""One of the most insidious forms of violence against women is also one of the most hidden from public view: human trafficking. The U.S. Department of Labor is working with law enforcement on anti-trafficking teams in major metropolitan centers to crack down on perpetrators who use violence as a weapon to keep women working in conditions of modern-day slavery. We've taken unprecedented steps to protect women who are in this country as temporary foreign workers, because they are especially vulnerable to physical and sexual coercion. We're fighting for restitution for victims of trafficking and working in communities across the country to help them heal, get back on their feet and find employment to provide for their families. ""We're also working closely with our returning women veterans. These heroes face the same issues as their male counterparts, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, sleeplessness and battle injuries, but they also face distressingly high rates of domestic violence and sexual trauma. We know that this situation substantially increases their risk of homelessness and makes the readjustment to civilian life exponentially more difficult. The Department of Labor has released a trauma guide to give service providers new tools to tailor their treatments and better serve the unique needs of women veterans so they get the assistance they need to re-enter the workforce. ""Finally, the department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration is focused on preventing violence against women in the workplace. It's appalling that homicide is the leading cause of death for women in the workplace. OSHA takes this reality extremely seriously. While we know that workplace violence can strike anywhere at any time, research shows that health care and social service settings and late night retail establishments are at especially high risk. OSHA has issued the first-ever directive on inspecting incidences of workplace violence in health care settings and other industries vulnerable to this crime. We're partnering every day with employers and workers across the country to educate them on strategies to prevent and reduce workplace violence."""

"September 11, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20120911-0,"Jamaica, NY, apartment community cited by US Labor Department's OSHA for repeat and serious violations after 2 workers hospitalized","QUEENS, N.Y. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration has cited Rochdale Village Inc. for alleged repeat and serious violations of workplace health and safety standards after two maintenance employees were hospitalized for accidentally inhaling a powder pesticide. The apartment community, located in the Jamaica neighborhood of Queens, faces a total of $116,400 in proposed fines following an inspection by OSHA's Queens District Office. The employees – who were permitted to enter nonventilated compactor rooms to bag garbage after powder pesticide had been applied – lacked adequate respiratory protection, effective training and information to protect themselves from pesticides and other hazardous chemicals. OSHA found that Rochdale Village failed to conduct a workplace hazard assessment that would have identified these hazards. In addition, employees who changed air conditioning filters in the apartment complex lacked adequate respiratory protection. These conditions have resulted in citations carrying $71,500 in penalties for three repeat violations. A repeat violation exists when an employer previously has been cited for the same or a similar violation of a standard, regulation, rule or order at any other facility in federal enforcement states within the last five years. Rochdale Village was cited for similar hazards in January 2010. ""While these workers were released from the hospital the same day, this incident should not have occurred in the first place,"" said Kay Gee, OSHA's area director for Queens, Manhattan and Brooklyn. ""OSHA has cited Rochdale Village for similar hazards in the past. The recurrence of such conditions speaks to the need for the employer to address these hazards promptly, effectively and permanently."" Citations carrying $44,900 in penalties have been issued for seven serious violations after OSHA determined that employees who worked with caustic and hazardous chemicals in the compactor and chemical storage rooms lacked eye and hand protection, as well as emergency eyewash stations, and that Rochdale Village failed to both conduct an assessment to identify such hazards and evaluate confined space hazards associated with crawlspaces in which plumbers and handymen routinely worked. Additionally, employees who bagged garbage, and thus were exposed to needles and debris, were not subject to an exposure control plan and other safeguards to protect them from bloodborne pathogens. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known. ""An effective illness and injury prevention program in which employees and managers work together to identify and eliminate hazardous conditions can prevent injuries from occurring in the first place,"" said Robert Kulick, OSHA's regional administrator for New York. Rochdale Village Inc. has 15 days from receipt of its citations and proposed penalties to comply, meet informally with OSHA's area director or contest the findings before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. The citations can be viewed at http://www.osha.gov/ooc/citations/RochdaleVillages_citations.pdf . To ask questions, obtain compliance assistance, file a complaint or report workplace hospitalizations, fatalities or situations posing imminent danger to workers, the public should call OSHA's toll-free hotline at 800-321-OSHA (6742) or the agency's Queens office at 718-279-9060. Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are eligible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. OSHA's role is to ensure these conditions for America's working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education and assistance.

"September 11, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20120911,US Labor Department's OSHA awards $10.7 million in safety and health training grants to 72 organizations,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration today awarded $10.7 million through the Susan Harwood Training Grant Program to 72 nonprofit organizations, including community/faith-based groups, employer associations, labor unions, joint labor/management associations, and colleges and universities. The goals of the Susan Harwood Training Grant Program are to provide training and education for workers and employers on the recognition, avoidance, and prevention of safety and health hazards in their workplaces, and to inform workers of their rights and employers of their responsibilities under the Occupational Safety and Health Act. Target trainees include small-business employers and underserved low-literacy workers in high-hazard industries. Since 1978, more than 1.8 million workers have been trained through this program. The award categories for fiscal year 2012 grants include Capacity Building Developmental, Targeted Topic Training, and Training and Educational Materials Development. ""The Department of Labor is committed to ensuring that workers and employers are provided education and training on identifying and preventing serious workplace hazards. The grants awarded by the federal government today will provide workers and employers in some of the most dangerous industries with important tools to identify and eliminate such hazards,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. Sixteen new organizations have been awarded a total of $1.6 million in grants for Targeted Topic Training, and Training and Educational Materials Development. Both grant types require that recipients address occupational safety and health topics designated by OSHA, and support the development of quality training materials and educational programs that address identifying and preventing workplace hazards. OSHA has awarded approximately $785,000 in new Capacity Building Developmental grants to seven organizations whose past activities have demonstrated their ability to provide occupational safety and health training, education, and related assistance to workers and employers in high-hazard industries; small-business employers; and vulnerable workers. Organizations selected to receive these grants are expected to institutionalize organizational capacity to provide safety and health training on an ongoing basis. An additional $8.3 million representing follow-on grants has been awarded to 49 FY 2011 Capacity Building Developmental grantees that performed satisfactorily during the last year and provided awardable applications this year. ""The programs funded by these grants provide thousands of workers and employers with critical health and safety training and education. These programs are unique in that they provide in person, hands-on training that will have a long-lasting impact on improving workplace safety and health,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health Dr. David Michaels. The training grant program is named in honor of Susan Harwood, a former director of the Office of Risk Assessment in OSHA's former Directorate of Health Standards, who passed away in 1996. The programs receiving grants are designed to prevent work-related injuries, illnesses and deaths by providing the knowledge and tools that workers and employers need to identify and correct workplace safety and health hazards. The Susan Harwood Training Grant Program is an essential component of OSHA's efforts to provide workers in high-risk industries with training about job hazards and their rights. It also provides employers with crucial information about unsafe working conditions, mitigation strategies and other responsibilities under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970.

We honor them and their families by ensuring that they are never forgotten. ""We remember the fallen – the police officers and firefighters who ran into burning buildings as others ran out, and the brave first responders who gave their lives to save countless others. We also remember the working people of this tragedy – from the custodians and restaurant workers to the administrative staff, security guards and business executives who died inside the buildings that day. ""We lift up all of those who are helping us re-build. Our profound gratitude is with the dedicated construction workers who restored the Pentagon and are erecting a living memorial in lower Manhattan. ""We will never forget the incredible sacrifice of our service members who lost their lives and continue to ensure our security is never again threatened. We owe them much, not the least bit making sure our veterans never have to fight for jobs when they return home. And it is here that the U.S. Department of Labor has a critical role to play.

The center will build capacity within and across youth service delivery systems to improve employment and postsecondary education outcomes for youths with disabilities. ""Through our investment in this center today, we are laying the groundwork to ensure that youths with disabilities enter the 21st century workplace with the skills and experiences they need to succeed,"" said Kathy Martinez, assistant secretary of labor for disability employment policy. The center will build upon ODEP's ongoing efforts to promote policies and practices that improve transition outcomes for youths, including those with disabilities. It will have three areas of focus: career exploration, management and planning; youth development and leadership; and professional development. It will provide technical assistance, training and information to organizations operating youth programs funded by the Workforce Investment Act, as well as current and former Labor Department grantees, to aid them in integrating evidence-based, effective practices for improving transitional results for young people with disabilities who are enrolled in their programs. The center will work in collaboration with federal, state and local agencies across multiple systems, including education, workforce, juvenile justice, foster care, transportation, mental health, vocational rehabilitation and others, on effective practices and issues related to the transition of youths.

""When President Obama came into office, the economy was in a free fall, credit markets were frozen, and our nation was bleeding hundreds of thousands of jobs a month. We've now added back 4.6 million private sector jobs over the last 30 months, including nearly 2 million in the last year alone. ""An economic crisis that was decades in the making will not be solved overnight, but our recovery remains on a stable trajectory of positive job growth. Smart and steady wins the race. ""It's worth noting that, in the 38 months since the end of the recession in June 2009, we've created three times as many private sector jobs as we had at the same point following the 2001 recession. ""To continue our path forward, Congress must reject the voices who seek to gut funding for education and skills training at this pivotal moment for our nation. We have to make a college education affordable for every student willing to work hard, invest in skills training so Americans workers can compete in a 21st century economy and prevent a tax increase on middle-class families. We know that an enduring recovery must be built from the middle out and the bottom up not the top down. That's the key to securing our long-term prosperity."""

"September 6, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20120906,"US Labor Department sues Plymouth Meeting, Pa., brokerage firm to give up more than a half-million dollars in illegal profits","PLYMOUTH MEETING, Pa. – The U.S. Department of Labor has filed a lawsuit against defendants Dietrich & Associates Inc., an insurance brokerage firm in Plymouth Meeting, and its chief executive officer and sole shareholder, Kurt E. Dietrich, to disgorge $522,047 plus interest gained from illegal activities related to the company’s role as fiduciary to a hospital pension plan. The department’s suit is based on an investigation conducted by its Employee Benefits Security Administration that found violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. In or before 2003, Memorial Hospital-West Volusia Inc. in Deland, Fla., was merged into the Adventist HealthCare system. As part of that consolidation, the hospital terminated its defined benefit pension plan and sought the purchase of a single-premium group annuity to ensure the payment of vested benefits. Dietrich & Associates entered into an agreement with Memorial Hospital to act as the pension plan’s fiduciary in securing the annuity. Filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, the suit alleges that the defendants violated their fiduciary duties by receiving undisclosed and impermissible compensation totaling $522,047 from Hartford Life Insurance Co. in connection with the annuity purchase, exceeding the $50,000 that Memorial Hospital agreed would be paid for the defendants’ services. This payment violated the contractual provision barring the defendants from receiving compensation from any insurer for the pension plan’s annuity. Additionally, the suit alleges that Dietrich & Associates deceived the pension plan and its fiduciaries by falsifying the final bids of Hartford’s competitors so that Hartford would appear to have the lowest bid. This action prevented the pension plan from knowing the true cost of the defendants’ services and deprived the pension plan of the opportunity to negotiate the amount of any insurer-paid commission or other payment as an element of the total cost of its annuity. “The defendants clearly abused their authority by receiving this illegal compensation,” said Marc Machiz, EBSA’s regional director in Philadelphia. “This action underscores our commitment to hold fiduciaries accountable when they fail to meet their legal responsibilities.” In addition to giving up the illegal profits, the department’s suit seeks to permanently enjoin the defendants from serving as fiduciaries to any ERISA-covered plans. This case was investigated by EBSA’s Philadelphia Regional Office, and the suit was filed by the department’s Office of the Solicitor in Washington, D.C. Employers and workers can contact EBSA’s Philadelphia office at 215-861-5300 or toll-free at 866-444-3272 for help with problems relating to private sector retirement and health plans.

Proposed penalties total $66,600. ""Employers have a responsibility to ensure that they are protecting workers against known hazards in their plants,"" said Howard Eberts, OSHA's area director in Cleveland. ""OSHA is committed to investigating reports of workplace hazards and protecting workers on the job, especially when employers fail to do so."" Eight serious safety violations involve failing to evaluate each powered industrial truck operator's performance at least once every three years, regularly inspect powered industrial vehicles, establish proper lockout/tagout procedures for the energy sources of equipment, use undamaged web slings, properly guard machines and reduce compressed air used for cleaning to 30 pounds per square inch. Seven serious health violations involve failing to properly store flammable and combustible materials, use undamaged welding helmets, provide fire extinguishers, and use explosion-proof electrical fixtures in the paint room. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known. One other-than-serious violation is failing to train workers on using and cleaning respirators. An other-than-serious violation is one that has a direct relationship to job safety and health, but probably would not cause death or serious physical harm. This inspection was OSHA's first of the Akron company, which has 15 business days from receipt of its citations and proposed penalties to comply, request an informal conference with OSHA's area director or contest the findings before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. To ask questions, obtain compliance assistance, file a complaint, or report workplace hospitalizations, fatalities or situations posing imminent danger to workers, the public should call OSHA's toll-free hotline at 800-321-OSHA (6742) or the agency's Cleveland Area Office at 216-615-4266. Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. OSHA's role is to ensure these conditions for America's working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education and assistance.

"September 4, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20120904,"Nebraska auction company assessed more than $46,000 in penalties for child labor violations after underage worker suffers serious injury while herding cattle","VALENTINE, Neb.  The U.S. Department of Labor has assessed a total of $46,602 in civil money penalties against Valentine Livestock Auction Co. in Nebraska after a 15-year-old employee was crushed against a metal gate by a stampeding calf while herding cattle in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act's child labor provisions. The injured minor was pinned against a fence by the animal, estimated to weigh between 600 and 700 pounds, before being knocked to the ground and trampled, resulting in multiple injuries. She was airlifted to the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, where she remained for 40 days. An investigation by the Labor Department's Wage and Hour Division found a total of 26 violations of the FLSA's child labor provisions, including of occupational standards for allowing five minors to work herding cattle; employing three youths under the legal age of employment; employing minors outside of allowable time standards; and failing to record birth dates for 10 minor employees. Additionally, the division found one violation of Hazardous Occupations Order No. 2, which generally prohibits minors from operating motor vehicles, and three violations of Hazardous Occupations Order No. 5, which prohibits minors from operating power-driven woodworking machines. ""This case is another clear example of why it is critical for employers to keep minors safe on the job by learning and complying with America's child labor laws,"" said Michael Staebell, director of the Wage and Hour Division's Des Moines Area Office in Iowa, which conducted the investigation. ""The protection of our working youth is paramount. Employers need to take their responsibilities under the law very seriously. No monetary penalty can undo an injury to a child, but the penalties assessed in this case demonstrate that the Labor Department will use every enforcement tool available to ensure compliance with the regulations we enforce."" The company erroneously believed it was classified as an agricultural employer and thus subject to the FLSA's child labor in agriculture regulations, rather than the regulations pertaining to nonagricultural employers. After the division informed the employer of its status as a nonagricultural employer, the company took steps to comply and to ensure that future violations would not take place. Managers have been trained in child labor regulations, and the company has committed to additional ongoing training. The company also pledged to only allow 14- and 15-year-old employees to perform office work. The civil money penalties assessed have been paid in full. The FLSA establishes a minimum age of 18 for workers in those nonagricultural occupations that the secretary of labor finds and declares to be particularly hazardous for younger workers.

In a consent judgment approved by the department's Office of Administrative Law Judges, Brunswick Corp. and Lund Boat Co. have agreed to pay $295,000 in back wages and interest to 185 female job applicants who were rejected for entry-level positions at Lund's boat manufacturing plant in New York Mills, Minn. ""I am pleased that we were able to reach a fair settlement in this case, one which will provide immediate relief to the women involved and lasting protections for all job seekers who apply to work for Lund and Brunswick in the future,"" said OFCCP Director Patricia A. Shiu. ""OFCCP is committed to making sure that companies that hold federal contracts — profiting from taxpayer dollars — give workers a fair shot at employment and do not use gender as a factor when it comes to deciding who gets a job and who doesn't."" OFCCP investigators based in Chicago conducted a review of Lund Boat Co.'s New York Mills facility beginning in September 2007. Based on the findings, the agency determined Lund had failed to ensure that qualified female job applicants received equal consideration for employment without regard to their gender as required by Executive Order 11246. The department filed an administrative complaint with its Office of Administrative Law Judges on Nov. 30, 2011, alleging that Lund officials had systematically discriminated against female job applicants in 2006 and 2007. In addition to the financial remedies, the agreement requires Brunswick Corp. and Lund Boat Co. to extend job offers to at least 27 women in the original class as general laborer positions open. Seven class members already have been hired. The companies also have agreed to maintain and retain required employment records, undertake extensive self-monitoring measures to ensure that all hiring practices fully comply with the law and submit detailed progress reports to OFCCP for the next two years. Based in Lake Forest, Ill., Brunswick Corp. is a leading provider of marine, athletic and recreational products. Lund is part of the corporation's boat manufacturing division. In the past two years alone, Brunswick has held federal contracts worth more than $248 million with agencies including the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Coast Guard. In addition to Executive Order 11246, OFCCP enforces Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974. These three laws require those who do business with the federal government, both contractors and subcontractors, to follow the fair and reasonable standard that they not discriminate in employment on the basis of sex, race, color, religion, national origin, disability or status as a protected veteran.

"August 30, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20120830,MSHAs actions lead to more miners receiving temporary job reinstatements after registering discrimination complaints,"ARLINGTON, Va. – Stepped-up efforts by the U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration to educate miners about their safety and health rights, promptly and thoroughly investigate discrimination complaints, and take legal action with the help of department attorneys have led to a marked increase in the number of miners temporarily reinstated to their jobs after filing complaints of discrimination in the form of a suspension, layoff, discharge or other adverse action. The number of requests for temporary reinstatements the department submitted on behalf of miners who filed discrimination complaints more than tripled from the period of fiscal years 2007-2009 to the period of FY 2010-2012 (through July 31, 2012), increasing from 22 to 71. Additionally, the department filed 70 complaints alleging mine safety discrimination during the period of FY 2010-2012 (through July 31, 2012), up from 39 from FY 2007-2009. According to Section 105(c) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, a miner cannot be discharged, discriminated against or interfered with in the exercise of statutory rights because he or she has filed a complaint alleging a health or safety violation. In addition, miners have rights including, for example, to testify or assist in legal proceedings brought under the Mine Act, or to refuse to work under unsafe or unhealthy conditions. ""All miners have the right to a safe workplace, and the right to identify hazardous conditions and refuse unsafe work without fear of discrimination or retaliation,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""Since I arrived at MSHA nearly three years ago, one of my top goals has been to educate miners about those rights and protections, and to rigorously enforce them."" Issues relating to fears of discrimination and retaliation came to light during congressional hearings held in the wake of the Upper Big Branch Mine disaster. Statements from miners and family members of the miners who died indicated that mine employees had been reluctant to speak out about safety conditions in existence prior to the April 2010 explosion, fearing retaliation by management. Evidence uncovered during MSHA's investigation also supports those claims. In June 2011, MSHA released new Web-based training tools to help miners better understand their rights and responsibilities, including ""A Guide to Miners' Rights and Responsibilities""; an electronic form for filing an anonymous hazard complaint; a discrimination complaint packet; information about black lung benefits and resources; and a compendium of online videos addressing miners' concerns about unsafe working conditions, hiring decisions, how to refuse unsafe work, the role of supervisors and the role of miners' representatives who travel with federal inspectors. MSHA has instituted other measures to enhance enforcement of miners' rights, including a reorganization of the Office of Assessments, Accountability, Special Enforcement and Investigations to provide enhanced efficiency, staffing, oversight and training of special investigators. A guide for miners' representatives explaining their rights under the Mine Act is slated for completion this fall. The publication will include information on inspections and investigations, filing a hazardous condition complaint, accessing information using MSHA's Data Retrieval System and becoming a miners' representative."

Solis today announced more than $75 million in YouthBuild grants to help out-of-school youth earn a high school or General Educational Development diploma while learning critical occupational skills in construction, health care, information technology and other fields. ""YouthBuild offers young people the opportunity to earn academic and industry-recognized credentials, practice the skills they'll need to succeed at work, and experience what it means to contribute to their own success and that of their communities,"" said Secretary Solis. The grants range from $700,000 to $1.1 million each and together will fund 74 YouthBuild programs in 28 states and the District of Columbia. They will help nearly 5,000 young people obtain the certifications and skills necessary to achieve economic self-sufficiency. Including today's grantees, the Labor Department now actively funds 127 YouthBuild programs around the country. The YouthBuild grants announced today are the first awarded under new program regulations published in February 2012, which expand occupational skills training beyond construction to include fast-growing industries such as health care and information technology. The construction skills training programs funded teach valuable skills to participants who build or rehabilitate housing for low-income or homeless individuals and families in their communities. The non-construction skills training programs funded include leadership development and community service elements to ensure that youth maintain a connection to their communities through service and volunteerism. YouthBuild is a nonresidential, community-based alternative education program that provides classroom instruction and occupational skills training to at-risk individuals ages 16-24. Many participants have been in the juvenile justice system, are aging out of foster care, have dropped out of high school, or are otherwise at-risk of failing to reach key educational milestones and opportunities that lead to career fulfillment. 2012 YouthBuild Grant Awards Grantee City State Funding Amount Council on Substance Abuse-NCADD Montgomery Ala. $1,043,130 Pickens County Community Action Committee and Community Development Corp.

"August 29, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20120829,MSHA announces results of July impact inspections,"ARLINGTON, Va. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration today announced that federal inspectors issued 262 citations, 19 orders and three safeguards during special impact inspections conducted at eight coal mines and five metal/nonmetal mines last month. The monthly inspections, which began in force in April 2010 following the explosion at the Upper Big Branch Mine, involve mines that merit increased agency attention and enforcement due to their poor compliance history or particular compliance concerns, including high numbers of violations or closure orders; frequent hazard complaints or hotline calls; plan compliance issues; inadequate workplace examinations; a high number of accidents, injuries or illnesses; fatalities; and adverse conditions such as increased methane liberation, faulty roof conditions and inadequate ventilation. As an example from last month, MSHA conducted an impact inspection on July 17 at Rebco Coal Inc.'s Valley Mine No. 1 during the day shift. MSHA personnel captured and monitored the communication systems to prevent advance notification of the inspection. MSHA issued 54 citations and nine orders on the day of the inspection, followed by five more 104(b) withdrawal orders for the operator's failure to abate the outstanding violations. Inspectors found violations related to inadequate examinations, the mine's ventilation plan and the maintenance of electric equipment. The operator failed to conduct pre-shift examinations of the belt conveyor entry prior to miners working and traveling in the area, as well as adequate on-shift examinations of the belt conveyor entries. Inspectors also found that the operator did not properly maintain electric face equipment and failed to conduct adequate electrical examinations. These cited conditions were extensive, having existed over several weekly electrical examinations, and posed serious dangers to miners. The continuous mining machine was found cutting coal on the wrong side in conflict with the approved ventilation plan, and the area had only a third of the required amount of ventilation. Several water sprays on the machine were functioning with only half of the required water pressure, and the ventilation curtain used was not properly placed. Proper ventilation and controls for methane and respirable coal mine dust must be in place to prevent mine explosions and black lung disease. Inspectors issued a failure-to-abate order during the impact inspection because the operator had not removed accumulations of combustible materials such as empty rock dust bags, empty wooden pallets, garbage in three crosscuts along the intake roadway and small trash piles at various crosscuts along the intake. The accumulation of the combustible materials standard has been cited 24 times in a two-year period at this mine. Five other failure-to-abate orders were issued because the operator had not corrected violations on the roof bolting machine's automated temporary roof support systems, section power center, roof bolter and fire suppression systems. Inspectors also observed two faulty circuit breakers and a broken receptacle latch on the power center, and six defects on the roof bolter. This impact inspection was the second conducted by MSHA at this mine which, effective Aug. 10, entered into nonproducing status. ""Mine operators have an obligation under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act to conduct thorough examinations of workplaces and equipment to find and fix hazards to protect miners,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""A failure to do so can expose miners to injury, illness and death. MSHA takes these failures to comply seriously and, on Aug. 6, issued new rules requiring more thorough operator examinations."" As a second example from last month, MSHA conducted another impact inspection on July 17 at Cobalt Coal Corp. Mining Inc.'s Westchester Mine in McDowell County, W.Va. The inspection party captured the phones to prevent advance notice of the inspection. Inspectors issued 47 enforcement actions, including one imminent danger order, 39 citations, six unwarrantable failure orders and one safeguard. This impact inspection was the mine's first. An imminent danger order was issued when stray electrical current was detected on the frame of the section power center and the no. 2 shuttle car. The operator was cited for failing to maintain the underground electrical system in a safe operating condition. In total, 15 citations and orders were issued for not maintaining face equipment in permissible condition, as well as violations relating to electric equipment, trailing cables, grounding and underground high voltage distribution. The stray electrical current and other cited hazards could have electrocuted or seriously injured miners. Westchester Mine also failed to conduct weekly examinations on the roof bolter, complete the examination of the conveyor belt in its entirety, and perform adequate examinations of the alternate escapeway between the belt drive and the working section. The inspectors observed hazardous conditions on the directional lifeline and tripping/stumbling hazards in the walkway directly under the lifeline. These conditions should have been discovered during examinations and then corrected to provide miners with safe passage in the alternate escapeway during a mine emergency and while working underground. The operator also was cited for violations of standards covering roof and rib control, fire suppression and ventilation. Of 17 ventilation violations, one was not following the approved ventilation/methane dust control plan where the air quantity in the last open crosscut was approximately one-fourth of what is required. Inspectors found water accumulation up to 11 inches deep in the primary intake escapeway for a distance of 40 feet in an area with a mining height of 58 inches. These conditions, if left uncorrected, affect the effectiveness of the mine's ventilation system to control and remove methane, respirable dust and other contaminants from the miners' working environment. Since April 2010, MSHA has conducted 477 impact inspections, which have resulted in a total of 8,545 citations, 852 orders and 36 safeguards.

"August 29, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20131807,"WHD News Release: Judge finds Ohio-based Cascom Inc. liable for nearly $1.5 million in back wages, damages to employees misclassified as independent contractors [08/29/2012]","DAYTON, Ohio — The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio has found Cascom Inc. liable for back wages and liquidated damages totaling $1,474,266 owed to approximately 250 cable installers the Fairfield, Ohio, company misclassified as independent contractors in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act. The findings of fact were issued following a damages hearing in a lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Labor in 2009, after an investigation conducted by the Columbus District Office of the department's Wage and Hour Division. The court ruled in September 2011 that Cascom Inc. and its owner, Julia J. Gress, violated the FLSA by failing to compensate employees for hours worked in excess of 40 per work week because they were misclassified as independent contractors. ""The findings in this case bring justice to workers and their families by providing them with their rightfully earned wages,"" said Secretary of Labor Thomas E. Perez. ""Cascom's business model also hurt law-abiding employers, who were undercut by this illegal practice. The Labor Department is committed to ensuring compliance to protect middle-class workers and to level the playing field for responsible employers."" The installers were found to be employees covered by the FLSA, rather than independent contractors. Cascom Inc. was found to be liable for $737,133 in back wages and an equal amount in liquidated damages, which can be collected both from the company and its owner. The company has ceased operations, so the department will seek to collect from the owner as well. The misclassification of employees as something other than employees, such as independent contractors, presents a serious problem for affected employees, employers and the economy. Misclassified employees are often denied access to critical benefits and protections — such as family and medical leave, overtime, minimum wage and unemployment insurance — to which they are entitled. Employee misclassification also generates substantial losses to the Treasury and the Social Security and Medicare funds, as well as to state unemployment insurance and workers' compensation funds. Under the FLSA, an employment relationship must be distinguished from a strictly contractual one. An employee — as distinguished from a person who is engaged in a business of his or her own — is one who, as a matter of economic reality, follows the usual path of an employee and is dependent on the business that he or she serves. For more information, visit http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs13.htm . The FLSA requires that covered, nonexempt employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour for all hours worked, plus time and one-half their regular rates, including commissions, bonuses and incentive pay, for hours worked beyond 40 per week. Employers also are required to maintain accurate time and payroll records.

Solis today issued the following statement in recognition of Labor Rights Week, Aug. 27-31: ""This year's theme, 'Promoting Labor Rights is Everyone's Responsibility,' underscores the importance of partnerships between the Labor Department and other countries to educate migrant workers and their employers about U.S. labor laws. ""Making America's workplaces safe and fair for everyone is the hallmark of Labor Rights Week. We're committed to ensuring that workers are safe on the job and paid what they're owed by law. This means no one can be paid less than $7.25 an hour. It means overtime must be paid for each hour above 40 a week. And it means that employers must provide a safe workplace."" The department's Wage and Hour Division, which enforces federal laws governing a minimum wage, overtime pay, child labor and the rights of migrant workers, and the department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which is principally concerned with protecting workers from hazards on the job, are participating in Labor Rights Week events throughout the nation this week.

An investigation by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Employee Benefits Security Administration found that the Glastonbury, Conn.-based fiduciary investment adviser made investments in mutual funds on behalf of ERISA-covered defined benefit plan clients and received 12b-1 fees from those funds. A 12b-1 fee is paid by a mutual fund out of fund assets to cover certain expenses. USI Advisors failed to fully disclose the receipt of the 12b-1 fees, and to use those fees for the benefit of the plans either by directly crediting the amounts to the plans or by offsetting other fees the plans would be obligated to pay the company. “If you, as an investment adviser, are a fiduciary under ERISA with respect to plan investments in mutual funds, you cannot use your fiduciary authority to receive an additional fee or to receive compensation from third parties for your own personal account in transactions involving plan assets. We are very pleased that this settlement addresses the problems we identified with USI’s practices and restores funds to the plans and their participants,” said Phyllis C. Borzi, assistant secretary of labor for employee benefits security. “We are also very pleased that recently finalized fee disclosure regulations issued by the Labor Department will require fiduciaries like USI to be more transparent about the fees they receive when dealing with their plan clients.” Under the terms of the settlement, USI Advisors has agreed not to provide bundled investment advisory and actuarial services to any ERISA-covered defined benefit plan client without first entering into a written agreement, contract or letter of understanding that specifies the services provided and whether the company or its affiliates will act as a fiduciary to those plans. USI Advisors also will provide to clients a description of all compensation and fees received, in any form, from any source, involving any investment or transaction related to them. The alleged violations in this case occurred between 2004 and 2010. USI Advisors is a wholly owned subsidiary of USI Consulting Group, a Goldman Sachs Capital Partners Co. The investigation was conducted by EBSA’s Boston Regional Office as part of the agency’s Consultant/Adviser Project, which focuses on the receipt of improper or undisclosed compensation by employee benefit plan consultants and other investment advisers. The settlement was reached with the assistance of the Labor Department’s Regional Office of the Solicitor in Boston.

"August 22, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20120822,Statement by Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis on 2012 youth employment,"WASHINGTON – Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis today issued the following statement regarding the Bureau of Labor Statistics' ""Employment and Unemployment Among Youth Summary"" released Aug. 21: ""As young Americans all across the country prepare to head into a new school year, I'm excited to say that many more will take with them lessons learned through summer jobs. ""Yesterday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released its annual report on youth employment, and the numbers show that, while there's still work to be done, opportunities are growing for young people around the country. It's no secret that the effects of the 2007 recession had a significant impact on job prospects for youth, but today's report showed positive signs that job prospects for young people picked up pace in 2012. ""Between April and July of each year, the youth labor force (16- to 24-year-olds working or actively looking for a job) grows significantly, as a large number of students take on summer work and new graduates enter the job market. So July traditionally marks the peak of youth employment during the year. ""Yesterday's report shows that youth employment rose by 2.1 million between April and July 2012, with 19.5 million young people employed last month. That's up from 18.6 million a year ago. The youth unemployment rate showed a significant decline, falling to 17.1 percent – down a percentage point from last year and two points from 2010. Meanwhile the share of young people employed in July 2012 climbed back up to 50.2 percent from its historic low last year. ""Youth employment increased across a wide variety of industries, including education and health services, manufacturing, transportation and utilities, but there remains much work to be done, especially within communities of color. ""While the labor force participation rate and employment-to-population ratios for African-Americans and Latinos all showed significant improvement from 2011 to 2012, both African-American (28.6 percent) and Latino (18.5 percent) youth continue to have a much higher unemployment rate than their white counterparts (14.9 percent). ""Earlier this year the president and I both took a stand for the importance of summer employment, launching our Summer Jobs+ initiative. By teaming up with committed businesses, nonprofits and cities around the country, this effort provided more than 300,000 summer job opportunities for low-income and disadvantaged youth, including more than 100,000 paid positions. Together we're helping young people across the country realize that there's no substitute for the real-world experience of work and no replacement for the dignity that comes with earning your first paycheck."""

Utica food processing company Delorio Foods Inc. has been cited by the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration with 14 alleged serious violations at the company's Bleecker Street manufacturing facility for exposing workers to unsafe working conditions. Proposed penalties total $54,900 following an inspection initiated by OSHA in May. ""In one instance, the floor was coated with oil near a hot press, and in another, the exit route from a storage area was obstructed by a pallet of food and a trash can,"" said Chris Adams, OSHA's area director for Syracuse. ""Failing to correct the hazards would continue to expose workers to the dangers of falls, chemical burns, getting caught in a machine or being unable to exit the workplace swiftly in the event of an emergency."" The inspection found that working area floors were not kept free from slippery conditions and the exit route from a storage area was obstructed by a pallet of food and a trash can. OSHA inspectors also found that employees who were exposed to corrosive materials lacked adequate stations for quick flushing of the eyes and body if they came in contact with the materials. Additionally, inspectors found that the devices intended to be used for locking and tagging out the energy sources of machinery were being used incorrectly as personal locks in the men's locker room. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known. ""An effective illness and injury prevention program in which workers and managers work together to identify and eliminate hazardous conditions can prevent injuries from occurring in the first place,"" said Robert Kulick, OSHA's regional administrator in New York. To ask questions, obtain compliance assistance, file a complaint or report workplace hospitalizations, fatalities or situations posing imminent danger to workers, the public should call OSHA's toll-free hotline at 800-321-OSHA (6742) or the agency's Syracuse Area Office at 315-451-0808. Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees.

"August 22, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20120822,"US Labor Department's OSHA proposes nearly $68,000 in fines to Mass., New Hampshire contractors for fall hazards at Haverhill, Mass., work site","ANDOVER, Mass. – Employees at a Haverhill residential construction site were exposed to potentially deadly or disabling falls of up to 16 feet from a roof and a scaffold that lacked fall protection. Conditions found during inspections by the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration point to falls as the leading cause of death in construction work. As a result, OSHA is calling upon employers in Massachusetts and the Merrimack Valley to take effective action to reduce and minimize fall hazards. ""Falls are the No. 1 killer in construction work, having taken the lives of more than 250 of this nation's construction workers in 2010 – the latest data available,"" said Marthe Kent, OSHA's regional administrator in Boston. ""To help stop this needless loss of life, OSHA has launched a campaign to remind employers and employees alike of what they can do to eliminate fall hazards at their work sites."" OSHA and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health are working with trade associations, labor unions, employers, universities, community and faith-based organizations, and consulates to provide employers and workers – especially vulnerable, low-literacy workers – with education and training on common-sense fall prevention equipment and strategies that save lives. OSHA also has created a new fall prevention Web page – http://www.osha.gov/stopfalls – with detailed information in English and Spanish on fall protection standards. The page includes fact sheets, posters and fall prevention videos that vividly illustrate various fall hazards and appropriate preventive measures. Inspections by OSHA's Andover Area Office at the Haverhill work site, located at 75 Cedar St., resulted in citations issued to two contractors: Juan Acero, doing business as Speedy 3 Construction of Lowell, Mass., and Edmunds General Contracting of Salem, N.H. Inspectors found that workers were exposed to fall hazards, adequate fall protection training had not been provided, a ladder was being misused to support the scaffolding and a damaged ladder had not been removed from service. Workers also were exposed to laceration hazards from an unguarded air compressor. Finally, Edmunds failed to have the site inspected for hazards by a competent person, that is, one with the knowledge to identify hazards and the authority to have them corrected. Speedy 3 Construction has been issued citations with $36,960 in fines for five repeat and two serious violations, while Edmunds General Contracting was issued citations with $30,900 in fines for two repeat and six serious violations. OSHA cited Speedy 3 Construction for similar hazards in 2011 and 2012 at sites in Lawrence, Peabody and West Newton, Mass., and Edmunds was cited in 2011 for similar hazards at sites in Lawrence and Peabody. Proposed fines for both contactors total $67,860. A repeat violation exists when an employer previously has been cited for the same or a similar violation of a standard, regulation, rule or order at any other facility in federal enforcement states within the last five years. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known. ""What's frustrating is that these employers had been cited before for fall-related hazards but allowed the hazards to recur,"" said Jeffrey Erskine, OSHA's area director for Middlesex and Essex counties. ""These hazards could have been prevented by planning ahead to do the job safely, providing workers with proper equipment, and training them to recognize and address fall hazards."" Each employer has 15 business days from receipt of its citations and proposed penalties to comply, meet with OSHA or contest the findings before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. To ask questions, obtain compliance assistance, file a complaint, or report workplace hospitalizations, fatalities or situations posing imminent danger to workers, the public should call OSHA's toll-free hotline at 800-321-OSHA (6742) or the agency's Andover office at 978-837-4460. Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. OSHA's role is to ensure these conditions for America's working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education and assistance.

"August 20, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20120820-1,US Labor Department sues to restore more than $34 million to 2 worker pension funds of Michigan-based vehicle parts manufacturer,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor has sued to restore more than $34 million in assets to two retirement funds of Michigan-based vehicle parts manufacturer Metavation LLC that allegedly were used in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The department named in its lawsuit George Hofmeister, chairman and director of Metavation, and Bernard Tew, managing director of Tew Enterprises LLC and Bluegrass Investment Management LLC. The latter two companies acted as investment advisers to the two plans. The suit also names Metavation LLC, a subsidiary of Lexington, Ky.-based Revstone Industries LLC. “Retirees who rely on pension plans should not have to worry about whether these funds are secure,” said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. “That is why those who are entrusted with managing pension funds are held to the highest legal standards and will be held accountable by the Labor Department if they violate that trust.” In 2008, Revstone subsidiary Cerion LLC acquired Metavation LLC, formerly Hillsdale Automotive, and took control of the pension plans. The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky, is based on the results of an investigation by the Labor Department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration that found numerous ERISA violations beginning in February 2009, just three months after Hillsdale had been acquired. The violations include prohibited loans to related companies within the Revstone Industries corporate family, prohibited use of plan assets for the purchase and lease of employer property, prohibited purchase of customer notes from companies within Revstone Industries, prohibited purchase of investments from adverse parties, payment of excessive fees to services providers, and the improper allocation of income and expense payments between the pension plans. The suit alleges that, as a result of the defendants engaging in these prohibited transactions, approximately $12.1 million from the Hillsdale Salaried Pension Plan and approximately $22.5 million from the Hillsdale Hourly Pension Plan were improperly used. Together, the plans report having assets now valued at approximately $36 million. As of November 2010, there were 367 participants in the salaried plan and 1,161 participants in the hourly plan, the latest data available. “The Department of Labor is committed to protecting the assets of workers’ pension plans from misuse by plan fiduciaries and service providers,” said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Employee Benefits Security Phyllis C. Borzi. “These workers are relying on their money being there for them when they retire. Our aim is to make this situation right.” The department’s suit asks the court to order the defendants to correct all prohibited transactions related to the loans and use of plan assets, restore any losses to the plans (including interest) resulting from fiduciary breaches and transfer to the plans all gains resulting from their ERISA violations. The suit also asks the court to remove the defendants as fiduciaries of the plans and prohibit them from serving as fiduciaries or service providers in the future to any plan covered by ERISA. Finally, the suit seeks the appointment of an independent fiduciary to administer the plans. Revstone Industries LLC designs, engineers and manufactures components for use in the transportation and heavy truck industries. Revstone Industries wholly owns Cerion LLC, which wholly owns Metavation LLC. George Hofmeister also is the chairman of Revstone Industries. This case was investigated by EBSA’s Cincinnati Regional Office. It is being litigated by the department’s Chicago Regional Office of the Solicitor. Employers and workers can contact EBSA’s Cincinnati office at 859-578-4680 or toll-free at 866-444-3272 for help with problems relating to private sector retirement and health plans.

"August 13, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20120813,"US Labor Department announces nearly $100 million in grants available for states to implement, improve short-time compensation or 'work sharing'","WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor today announced the availability of nearly $100 million in grants for states to implement or improve existing short-term compensation, commonly referred to as ""work sharing,"" programs. This funding has been made available through the bipartisan Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 signed by President Obama in February, which authorized states to set up programs to give employers an alternative to layoffs. ""Establishing or expanding work-sharing programs nationwide will help business owners better weather hard economic times by temporarily reducing their labor costs while still keeping their existing skilled employees,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""This program is a win-win for businesses and employees alike."" Work sharing allows employees to keep their jobs and helps employers to avoid laying off their trained workforces during economic downturns by reducing the hours of work for an entire group of affected workers. Workers affected by reduced hours can have their wages compensated with a portion of their weekly unemployment compensation payments. The legislation requires each state to submit a complete application to the Labor Department in order to receive a grant. Any state that currently has an active short-time compensation program is eligible to apply if the state's law on work sharing conforms to Section 3306(v) of the Federal Unemployment Tax Act and its program is not subject to discontinuation. Each state has a designated allotment from the total grant funds available. One-third of the allotted grant money for each state will be used to implement or improve a short-time compensation program, and two-thirds will be available to promote and enroll employers in the program. The department will provide technical assistance through webinars and other methods to help states achieve the purposes of the grants. The department also will collect and disseminate successful practices based on program implementation as well as outreach tools developed as a result of these grants. For more information and an application checklist, read the Unemployment Insurance Program Letter No. 27-12 distributed by the Labor Department's Employment and Training Administration at http://s.dol.gov/UR.

"August 6, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20120806,MSHA's 'examinations' rule for underground coal mines effective Aug. 6,"ARLINGTON, Va. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration's final rule ""Examinations of Work Areas in Underground Coal Mines for Violations of Mandatory Health or Safety Standards,"" which was published April 6, 2012, in the Federal Register, becomes effective today. The rule requires mine operators to identify and correct hazardous conditions and violations of nine health and safety standards that pose the greatest risk to miners, including the kinds of conditions that led to the deadly explosion at the Upper Big Branch Mine in April 2010. ""Effective pre-shift, supplemental, on-shift and weekly examinations are the first line of defense to protect miners working in underground coal mines,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. After analyzing its accident reports and enforcement data for underground coal mines covering a five-year period, MSHA determined that the same types of violations of health or safety standards are found by MSHA inspectors in underground coal mines every year, and that these violations present some of the most unsafe conditions for coal miners. ""These repeated violations expose miners to unnecessary safety and health risks that should be found and corrected by mine operators. The final rule, effective today, will increase the identification and correction of unsafe conditions in mines earlier, removing many of the conditions that could lead to danger, and improve protection for miners in underground coal mines,"" said Main. The rule requires that, during pre-shift, supplemental, on-shift and weekly examinations, underground coal mine operators, in addition to examining for hazardous conditions as in the existing regulations, examine for violations of the nine specific health and safety standards. The rule also requires operators to record the actions taken to correct hazardous conditions, as in the existing regulations, and violations of the nine standards. Additionally, operators must review with mine examiners, on a quarterly basis, citations and orders issued in areas where pre-shift, supplemental, on-shift and weekly examinations are required. The nine standards address ventilation, methane, roof control, combustible materials, rock dust, equipment guarding and other safeguards. They are consistent with the standards emphasized in MSHA's Rules to Live By initiative and the types of violations cited in MSHA's accident investigation report on the Upper Big Branch Mine explosion as contributing to the cause of that deadly accident. MSHA launched Rules to Live By, an outreach and enforcement program designed to strengthen efforts to prevent mining fatalities, in February 2010. In 2011, MSHA issued approximately 158,000 violations, of which approximately 77,000 were attributable to underground coal mines, even though these mines represent just 4 percent of all mines."

Applicants must respond to the entire scope of work outlined in the solicitation and demonstrate a proven ability to manage complex projects designed to improve the lives of children. Applications must be submitted by Oct. 2 at 5 p.m. EDT electronically via http://www.grants.gov or as hard copies mailed to the U.S. Department of Labor, Office of Procurement Services, 200 Constitution Ave. NW, Room S-4307, Washington, D.C. 20210, Attention: Brenda White and James Kinslow.

"August 3, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20120803,Statement by Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis on July employment numbers,"WASHINGTON – Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis issued the following statement on the July 2012 Employment Situation report released today: ""Our nation's labor market added 163,000 nonfarm payroll jobs in July, which exceeded all forecasts and represented the country's strongest July job growth since 2006. ""The unemployment rate remained essentially unchanged at 8.3 percent, while the share of long-term unemployed fell to its lowest level since 2009. The Latino unemployment rate dropped nearly a percentage point last month to 10.3 percent. ""Over 29 straight months of private sector job growth, the economy has created 4.5 million jobs that didn't exist when President Obama came to office, including 172,000 new private sector jobs in July and 1.1 million generated in 2012 alone. We still have more work to do to help every American looking for work find a good job, but this report reinforces that we remain on the right track. If we continue to invest in the American worker and avoid wrong-headed tax increases on middle-class families, we'll stay on our current trajectory to achieve a full recovery in record time. ""July's job growth was broad-based and reached nearly every sector. With bipartisan cooperation, I believe we can grow jobs even faster. For instance, over the last 30 months, our manufacturing sector has seen its largest job gains since 1989. We added 25,000 new manufacturing jobs last month alone, but we could grow this number in the months ahead if Congress would embrace President Obama's proposal to end tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas and instead reward companies that bring good jobs home. Unfortunately, obstructionists on Capitol Hill blocked the administration's common-sense plan to do so. ""One of the most damaging things we could do to our recovery is raise taxes on the middle class. We know that spending by the middle class stimulates growth, and that spending on the middle class generates a ripple effect throughout our economy. Keeping earnings in the pockets of hardworking families to spend on our economy helps our job creators grow their businesses and make new hires. The efforts by some in Congress to hold middle-class tax relief hostage to more tax cuts for the wealthy is deeply irresponsible and unhelpful to our recovery."""

"July 31, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20120731,MSHA announces results of June impact inspections,"ARLINGTON, Va. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration today announced that federal inspectors issued 177 citations, 22 orders and one safeguard during special impact inspections conducted at nine coal mines and three metal/nonmetal mines last month. The monthly inspections, which began in force in April 2010 following the explosion at the Upper Big Branch Mine, involve mines that merit increased agency attention and enforcement due to their poor compliance history or particular compliance concerns, including high numbers of violations or closure orders; frequent hazard complaints or hotline calls; plan compliance issues; inadequate workplace examinations; a high number of accidents, injuries or illnesses; fatalities; and adverse conditions such as increased methane liberation, faulty roof conditions and inadequate ventilation. As an example from last month, MSHA conducted an impact inspection on June 21 during the second shift at Bledsoe Coal Corp.'s Abner Branch Rider Mine in Leslie County, Ky. Inspectors immediately seized and monitored the mine's communications systems to ensure that advance notification was not provided to the miners underground. The 19 citations and 12 withdrawal orders inspectors issued as a result of violations found effectively shut down the entire mine for eight days. Violations included accumulations of combustible materials in the motor compartment of a utility vehicle located in the primary escapeway; accumulations of loose coal, coal dust, black float coal dust and hydraulic oil on the roof bolting machine, along the mine floor and against the ribs; and an improperly functioning methane monitor, which did not provide a warning or de-energize the mechanized mining unit when necessary. MSHA also cited the operator for defective, bare electrical wires and inadequate splices on the utility vehicle in the primary escapeway. If left uncorrected, these conditions could spark a methane ignition, which, combined with inadequate rockdusting, could cause or contribute to a coal dust explosion. Additionally, the mine operator did not provide adequate roof/rib control and failed to follow the mine's approved roof control plan. The operator also failed to identify, record and correct the absence of mesh that would prevent the fall of sections of the mine's ribs and roof. On April 12, 2011, MSHA had issued a pattern of violations notice to the Abner Branch Rider Mine, one of only two mines ever to receive such a notice. Since then, the mine has been issued 53 orders. Last month's impact inspection was the third conducted at the Abner Branch Rider Mine. The mine's operations returned to normal on June 29 after the violations were abated and the withdrawal orders terminated. ""The Federal Mine Safety and Health Act requires operators to provide a safe workplace, and that includes finding and fixing hazards in order to keep miners from getting injured or killed. If operators ignore that responsibility and leave it to MSHA to find their problems, they should know that MSHA will use the full force of the law – including closure orders – to protect the nation's miners,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""It is clear that, in the case of Abner Branch, a mine already on a pattern of violations, all of MSHA's tools may not be enough. But until that changes, we will use what we have and aggressively enforce the law to ensure men and women who go into a mine at the beginning of a shift can come back out at the end of it."" As a second example from last month, MSHA personnel conducted an impact inspection on June 20 at Tunnel Ridge LLC's Tunnel Ridge Mine in Ohio County, W.Va., during the evening shift. The inspection party secured the mine's phones to prevent advance notice of the inspection. MSHA issued 34 enforcement actions, including 29 citations and five unwarrantable failure orders. This impact inspection was the second of the Tunnel Ridge Mine. An unwarrantable failure order was issued for failure to maintain the intake escapeway on the longwall section from the mine's working face. The escapeway was obstructed with mud and water up to 15 inches deep for a distance of 300 feet. A subsequent order was issued for the mine operator's failure to identify this hazardous condition during the preshift examination. By not recognizing and recording this hazard, the mine operator placed miners at risk of not having a safe way to exit the mine. The mine operator also was cited for failing to conduct required methane tests at each working face. The Tunnel Ridge Mine has a history of methane liberation. Failure to perform adequate methane checks during the mining and roof bolting cycle could allow an unknown quantity of methane gas to accumulate without miners' knowledge and lead to a possible methane ignition. An additional order was issued for the mine operator's failure to conduct an adequate preshift examination of the section. Conducting proper examinations and correcting hazardous conditions are essential to protect the health and safety of miners. Inadequate examinations allow miners to remain in areas where hazardous conditions may exist which, if left uncorrected, expose miners to the risk of severe injuries, illnesses or death. Since April 2010, MSHA has conducted 464 impact inspections, which have resulted in a total of 8,283 citations, 833 orders and 33 safeguards.

"July 27, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20120727,Statement by Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis on death of Lupe Ontiveros,"WASHINGTON – Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis today issued the following statement regarding the death of Lupe Ontiveros: ""Lupe Ontiveros' great talent extended far past television, stage and motion pictures. Indeed, she was a fine actress, but more than that, she was a woman of great action. And she was my friend for more than 20 years. ""Growing up in East Los Angeles in the 1970s, I never saw a family like mine on television, except portrayed as maids or farmworkers. And then Lupe came along and helped to change that. ""Certainly she played her share of maids. She once confided that she was cast as a maid somewhere between 150 and 300 times. Typical Lupe: She was proud that she could give maids a sense of dignity and the respect they deserved through her portrayals. ""As she established herself and her reputation as an actress, more and more different kinds of roles became available to her. Once she saw opportunities open up for her, she helped open opportunities for others. She used her celebrity, creativity and boundless energy to make a difference. That's when I really became a fan of hers. ""Whatever the issue – HIV/AIDS prevention; domestic violence prevention and legislation; women's health and employment; access to education; the rights of people with disabilities, especially individuals who are deaf and those with Down syndrome; representation of people of color in front of and behind the camera – Lupe was there. ""Few people know that, before she became an actress, Lupe was a social worker. She brought the skills she developed in that profession to all of her advocacy: She did her homework. She consulted experts. She rallied support and enlisted champions. She knew that every case is different and statistics are important, but behind them are people. She never complained. She always showed up. ""As an actress and entertainer, she made us laugh, and she made us cry. As an advocate, she made us think and, more importantly, she made us do something. I will miss her.""

""The federal grants announced today will provide job training to enhance low-income seniors' employment opportunities and contribute millions of community service hours to nonprofit and civic organizations throughout the country,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""These organizations are crucial partners in serving seniors who face challenges in re-entering the workforce and attaining economic stability."" Sixteen one-year grants are being made to 15 national nonprofit organizations through the program's general funds or funds set aside by statute to serve Native Americans or Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders. The grants will support more than 35,000 positions. In addition, state and territorial grantees that previously received funding through this program will continue to support more than 10,000 positions. The Senior Community Service Employment Program, authorized by Title V of the Older Americans Act, is the only federally sponsored employment and training program targeted specifically to unemployed, low-income individuals age 55 and older. Individuals served by the grants receive training through part-time, service-oriented positions in their communities while earning the highest of the federal, state or local minimum wage. The program has dual goals of promoting community service and helping participants achieve economic self-sufficiency by guiding them into unsubsidized employment, where appropriate. Program participants provide more than 48 million hours of community service to public agencies and nonprofit organizations annually. The Government Accountability Office reports in its paper ""Unemployed Older Workers: Many Experience Challenges Regaining Employment and Face Reduced Retirement Security"" that older workers who become unemployed tend to stay unemployed longer, and those who regain employment generally sustain greater wage losses than do younger workers. According to the 2011 SCSEP Customer Satisfaction Survey, program participants who attained unsubsidized employment indicated that SCSEP was very helpful in preparing them for a job.

"July 26, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20120726,US Department of Labor resolves action holding Lettire Construction Corp. responsible for labor violations,"Landmark enhanced compliance measures also secured covering company and its subcontractors on federal prevailing wage construction projects NEW YORK — The U.S. Department of Labor sent a strong message today that it will seek to hold general contractors responsible not only for their own violations of federal labor law, but also for those committed by their subcontractors, when it filed consent findings and an order against Lettire Construction Corp. The consent findings and order were filed today with the department's Office of Administrative Law Judges against Lettire Construction Corp., an industry leader in affordable housing construction, and its president, Nicholas Lettire, a New York general contractor. The filing follows a project-based investigation conducted by the department's Wage and Hour Division that found Lettire Construction and 16 of its subcontractors had violated provisions of the federal Davis-Bacon and Related Acts as well as the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act. The consent findings and order must be approved by the chief administrative law judge. This filing resolves an action brought by the department against Lettire Construction and its president claiming that the company and its subcontractors had committed numerous violations of federal law while constructing Hobbs Court and Ciena, two federally funded affordable housing developments in East Harlem, N.Y. ""The settlement makes absolutely clear that responsibility for complying with the federal prevailing wage laws rests with Lettire Construction and Nicholas Lettire, and the agreement requires them to take those actions that any 'high road' contractor should be taking to ensure its compliance and the compliance of its subcontractors with federal law on federal taxpayer funded projects,"" said Nancy J. Leppink, deputy administrator of the Wage and Hour Division. ""If Lettire Construction and Mr. Lettire fail to comply with the full terms of the agreement, there should be no doubt that the Wage and Hour Division will take action seeking to prohibit the company from bidding on future federal taxpayer funded projects. This action will help ensure that local prevailing wages and working conditions are not undercut by contractors who violate the law, and employers who play by the rules can compete on a level playing field for government contracts."" Solicitor of Labor M. Patricia Smith added, ""This action should serve as a warning to other contractors that the department's Wage and Hour Division has many enforcement tools available, including surveillance of workers moving on and off project sites, withholding of contract funds, litigation and debarment, to hold all parties from the top of the contract chain to the bottom accountable for compliance with the law."" The Hobbs and Ciena projects were part of the Metro North Rehabilitation and Redevelopment Program, which was funded in part by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 through the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal and the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development. The Wage and Hour Division's project-based investigation, which included several days of surveillance, found numerous violations of the DBRA and CWHSSA by Lettire Construction and 16 of its subcontractors. The investigation found some employees working more than 60 hours per week without proper payment. Violations included contractors failing to pay required prevailing wages and overtime compensation, providing inaccurate or falsified payroll records to the government, failing to keep accurate records of hours employees worked, failing to pay for all hours employees worked and improperly classifying employees who performed work on the projects, resulting in the underpayment of wages and fringe benefits. To protect the rights of workers on these projects, upon finding these violations, the Wage and Hour Division secured the withholding of project funds sufficient to pay the back wages owed. The settlement agreement calls for Lettire Construction to take affirmative steps to ensure its own and its subcontractors' future compliance, to guarantee payment for some of its subcontractors' violations as determined through administrative and court proceedings, and to guarantee payment for any future violations committed by its subcontractors on federally funded local, state and federal prevailing wage projects. Lettire Construction has agreed to hire a monitor approved by the Wage and Hour Division for at least three years to conduct regular compliance reviews of the company and its subcontractors on Davis-Bacon and other federally funded projects with the terms of the consent findings and order, as well as applicable federal and state laws. The monitor will provide training to Lettire Construction's staff and to its subcontractors, and will set up a hotline to collect confidential reports of noncompliance. The monitor will regularly report to the Wage and Hour Division the findings of all reviews, conduct reviews at the request of the division and provide notice to the division of all complaints received from workers on the hotline. Lettire Construction will be required to make corrections in response to the monitor's findings. Under the consent findings and order, Lettire Construction will be required to investigate prospective subcontractors. This requirement includes assessing subcontractors' bids on federal prevailing wage projects to determine whether they are adequate to ensure financial compliance with the law and taking this information into consideration when selecting subcontractors. The company must establish internal controls, including an electronic timekeeping system and electronic certified payrolls, to ensure accuracy and timeliness of certified payroll submissions, and will assign dedicated supervisors to oversee compliance on prevailing wage projects. In addition, the order will require Lettire Construction and its subcontractors to provide employees notice of their job classifications, wage and fringe benefit rates, and the hotline number. The notice also must advise workers of their rights to file a complaint without retaliation. The Wage and Hour Division resolved matters involving 14 of Lettire Construction's subcontractors on the Hobbs and Ciena projects that included the payment of $142,345 in DBRA back wages and fringe benefits to 85 mechanics and laborers. The division also has obtained debarments for a period of three years of three of Lettire Construction's subcontractors on the projects: Fairmont Industries, Sant-Tec Electric and Finest Security Service. A case against Lettire Construction subcontractors Enviro & Demo Masters Inc. and Gladiators Contracting Corp. and their principals, which seeks debarment and approximately $815,638 in additional DBRA back wages and fringe benefits for 40 mechanics and laborers, has been tried and is currently pending before an administrative law judge. The Davis-Bacon Act requires all contractors and subcontractors performing work on federal and certain federally funded projects to pay their laborers and mechanics the proper prevailing wage rates and fringe benefits as determined by the secretary of labor. The Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act applies to contractors and subcontractors with federal service contracts and federally funded and assisted construction contracts exceeding $100,000.

Awarded to the Louisiana Workforce Commission, the funds will provide help to the workers in conjunction with services they will receive in the form of Trade Adjustment Assistance benefits. The city of Shreveport is responsible for managing re-employment activities under the grant, including career counseling, job search assistance, training and support services. Of the $2 million announced today, $510,750 will be released initially. Additional funding up to the amount approved will be made available as the state demonstrates a continued need for assistance.

"July 24, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20120724,"Georgia, Illinois, North Carolina and Texas receive $3 million in grants to help recent Army veterans find civilian employment more quickly","WASHINGTON – The states of Georgia, Illinois, North Carolina and Texas will receive grants totaling $3 million to develop strategies aimed at helping returning Army veterans find employment more quickly through the public workforce system, Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis announced today. This funding represents an initiative of the U.S. Department of Labor and the U.S. Army under the Unemployment Compensation for Ex-service Members program. ""The Labor Department is deeply committed to providing employment services and benefits that best support the men and women who have served our country, and the grants announced today are an example of that commitment,"" said Secretary Solis. ""Ensuring Army veterans have expedited access to job training and job placement services is one way our nation honors their sacrifices."" This initiative will provide each of the four states with $750,000 to develop new strategies to enhance outreach and re-employment services for Army unemployment compensation claimants. Examples of strategies include improved tracking of claimants across federal programs to better link unemployed veterans to potential job opportunities; increasing staff capacity to help claimants understand which military skills can be transferred to civilian careers; expanding service delivery through agency partnerships, such as opening employment service satellite offices in U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs locations; and expanding outreach activities to better connect these veterans to American Job Centers, job fairs and other services that can expedite their return to work. ""These grants are an important step toward ensuring that the soldiers who so valiantly and selflessly served our nation get the help they need transitioning back to civilian life,"" said Secretary of the Army John McHugh. ""By sharing information, improving access to re-employment services and increasing outreach opportunities, we can help Army veterans get better access to and information about job opportunities. I'm grateful to Secretary Solis and the Department of Labor for their support. This is great news for the Army and its veterans."" The four states selected have large populations of Army veterans who are unemployment compensation claimants and have been actively collaborating with both the Labor Department and the Army to improve veterans' access to the public workforce system. These grants will be implemented over the next two years, and the promising practices developed with these investments will be shared with other states and expanded to include other branches of the military.

"July 24, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20120724,"C.J.'s Seafood of Breaux Bridge, La., instructed to pay fines and back wages after US Department of Labor investigations","OSHA proposes more than $34,000 in fines for exposing workers to hazards; Wage and Hour Division seeks nearly $214,000 in back wages and penalties BATON ROUGE, La. — The U.S. Department of Labor today issued findings from investigations of C.J.'s Seafood Inc. in Breaux Bridge. The department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration has cited C.J.'s Seafood with 11 serious and one other-than-serious safety violation for exposing workers to blocked exit, fire, electrical and chemical hazards. Additionally, the department's Wage and Hour Division found that the company failed to pay minimum wage and overtime compensation to 73 workers as required by the Fair Labor Standards Act, and to comply with provisions of the H-2B temporary foreign worker visa program established under the Immigration and Nationality Act. ""It is imperative that employers comply with applicable laws that protect the health and safety of their workers,"" said Dr. David Michaels, assistant secretary of labor for occupational safety and health. ""Every worker deserves to go home safe at the end of a workday, and the employees at C.J.'s Seafood are entitled to nothing less."" OSHA's Baton Rouge Area Office conducted an investigation of the company's facility in Breaux Bridge, where employees peel and boil seafood. Some of the serious violations cited pertain to the building not being equipped with fire extinguishers, exit signs or emergency eyewash stations. In addition, electrical breakers were not labeled, electrical outlets were not covered, an exit was blocked and temporary wiring was being used instead of permanent wiring. Finally, the employer did not have a written hazard communications program and did not make material safety data sheets available to employees to inform them of hazards in the workplace. These citations carry proposed penalties of $32,200. A serious violation is one in which there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known. The other-than-serious violation involves failing to maintain the OSHA 300 log, in which employee injuries and illnesses must be recorded. This citation carries a monetary penalty of $2,100. An other-than-serious violation is one that has a direct relationship to job safety and health, but probably would not cause death or serious physical harm. C.J.'s Seafood has 15 business days from receipt of the citations and proposed penalties to comply, request an informal conference with OSHA's Baton Rouge area director or contest the citations and penalties before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. The Wage and Hour Division's New Orleans District Office conducted an investigation that found C.J.'s Seafood violated the FLSA's minimum wage, overtime compensation and record-keeping requirements by paying ""straight time"" instead of the required overtime rate for hours beyond 40 in a workweek; making illegal deductions from employees' wages for items required by their jobs, such as gloves, hairnets and aprons; and failing to maintain records of the hours employees worked. The employer also violated H-2B provisions by misrepresenting its temporary need for foreign workers, including the dates of need and number of workers needed, and also by failing to pay the required wage rate. ""This employer took illegal advantage of the H-2B program, which put it in a position to undercut its competition that plays by the rules,"" said Nancy Leppink, deputy administrator of the Wage and Hour Division. ""American workers seeking jobs should not be compelled to accept substandard wages and working conditions due to employers' abuse of temporary foreign worker visa programs."" A total of $76,608 is due to the 73 workers, and the company is liable for an additional $70,014 in liquidated damages. The division also has assessed $32,120 in civil money penalties under the FLSA for willful violations of the employer's obligation to pay overtime and $35,000 in civil money penalties for willful violations of the H-2B program. C.J.'s Seafood has refused to pay the full amount of back wages that the division found due, and the liquidated damages and civil money penalties. The division will pursue all appropriate administrative and legal remedies to the full extent of its authority. These may include legal proceedings before the Labor Department's Administrative Review Board and in federal district court. The FLSA requires that covered employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour for all hours worked, plus time and one-half their regular rates, including commissions, bonuses and incentive pay, for hours worked beyond 40 per week. Employers also must maintain accurate time and payroll records. The H-2B guest worker program permits employers to temporarily hire nonimmigrants to perform nonagricultural labor or services in the United States. The employment must be of a temporary nature, such as a one-time occurrence or for a seasonal or peak load need. The program requires the employer to attest to the Department of Labor that it will offer a wage that equals or exceeds the highest of the prevailing wage, applicable federal minimum wage, state minimum wage or local minimum wage for the occupation in the area of intended employment during the entire period of the approved certification. Additionally, certain recruitment and displacement standards have been established in order to protect similarly employed workers in the United States. Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. OSHA's role is to ensure these conditions for America's working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education and assistance. Employers and employees with questions regarding workplace safety and health standards can call OSHA's Baton Rouge office at 225-298-5458 or the agency's toll-free hotline at 800-321-OSHA (6742) to report workplace incidents, fatalities or situations posing imminent danger to workers.

"July 24, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20120724,US Department of Labor files suit to recover losses to employee stock ownership plan of SJP Group,"CLIFFWOOD BEACH, N.J. ‒ The U.S. Department of Labor has filed a lawsuit seeking to recover losses suffered by participants in the SJP Group Inc. Employee Stock Ownership Plan. The department’s suit is based on an investigation conducted by its Employee Benefits Security Administration that found violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. SJP Group Inc., a paving and building site company, is headquartered in Cliffwood Beach. The suit names as a defendant First Bankers Trust Services Inc., which was hired as an independent fiduciary to advise the company’s ESOP on whether, and at what price, to purchase shares of SJP Inc. from its majority shareholder, Vincent DiPano. DiPano, who also is named as a defendant, was a fiduciary of the plan as well as an officer and member of the board of directors of SJP Group. The ESOP, too, is a defendant. The suit alleges that on or around April 16, 2007, First Bankers Trust Services did not fulfill its fiduciary duties when it approved the ESOP’s purchase of 38 percent of the outstanding stock of SJP Group from DiPano for $16 million, which was more than fair market value. DiPano allegedly sold his shares to the plan for what he knew or should have known was in excess of what the stock was worth. An ESOP is a type of retirement plan that is permitted to invest some or all of its assets in employer stock. Because participants’ benefits depend on the ESOP buying and selling stock for fair market value, the department intends to make certain that the price an ESOP pays for the plan sponsor’s stock reflects its true market value, those retained to advise an ESOP about the stock purchase fulfill their fiduciary duties under ERISA and those who sell their shares to an ESOP do not receive a windfall. In addition to recovering all losses, the suit seeks to have First Bankers Trust Services and DiPano permanently enjoined from serving as fiduciaries to ERISA-covered plans. The suit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey and is being litigated by the department’s Regional Office of the Solicitor in New York. Employers and workers can reach EBSA’s New York office at 212-607-8600 or toll-free at 866-444-3272 for help with problems related to private sector retirement and health plans.

"July 19, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20120719,US Department of Labor finds 2 companies in violation of   Federal Railroad Safety Act for retaliating against 3 Midwest whistleblowers,"CHICAGO – The U.S. Department of Labor has ordered two railroad companies to pay three workers a total of $650,729.14 in back wages and damages for retaliating against them for reporting workplace injuries and safety concerns. The orders resulted from investigations conducted by the Chicago office of the department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which were initiated upon receiving complaints from the employees. ""It is critically important that railroad employees in the Midwest and across the nation know that OSHA intends to defend the rights of workers who report injuries and safety concerns,"" said Dr. David Michaels, assistant secretary of labor for occupational safety and health. ""We will use the full force of the law to make sure that workers who are retaliated against for reporting health and safety concerns are made whole."" OSHA conducted the investigations under the whistleblower provisions of the Federal Railroad Safety Act, as amended by the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007. Railroad carriers are subject to the FRSA, which protects employees who report violations of any federal law, rule or regulation relating to railroad safety or security, or who engage in other protected activities. OSHA determined that Illinois Central Railroad violated the FRSA by retaliating against two employees in separate incidents for reporting workplace injuries at the Markham Railroad Yard in Markham, Ill. The first employee, a conductor, was injured in August 2008 when he was knocked unconscious and sustained injuries to his shoulder, back and head while switching railcars in the Markham Yard. A knuckle that connects the cars allegedly broke, causing the cars to suddenly jolt and the employee to fall. The railroad held an investigative hearing and consequently terminated the conductor, alleging that he had violated safety rules. However, OSHA found that the worker was terminated in reprisal for reporting a work-related injury. The department's order requires the railroad to pay the conductor a total of $269,707.27, which includes $81,393.49 in back wages, $4,695.78 in vacation pay, $4,368 for medical bills and $4,250 in attorney's fees, as well as punitive damages of $100,000 and compensatory damages of $75,000. The second employee, a carman, reported an arm/shoulder injury that occurred in February 2008. While walking along a platform to inspect railcars in the poorly lit yard, the carman slipped on ice and tried to catch himself, which jolted his left arm and shoulder. The railroad held an investigative hearing and consequently terminated the carman's employment for allegedly violating the company's injury reporting procedures. OSHA concluded that the carman had properly reported the injury, and has ordered the railroad to reinstate the worker if he is medically released by his physician and passes a functional capacity evaluation. Additionally, the railroad must pay the employee a total of $154,694, including $14,694 in back wages, punitive damages of $75,000 and compensatory damages of $65,000. Illinois Central Railroad also must provide a copy of OSHA's ""Whistleblower Protection for Railroad Workers"" fact sheet to every employee at the Markham Yard. In the third incident, OSHA determined that Chicago Fort Wayne & Eastern Railroad violated the FRSA by terminating a conductor in retaliation for raising concerns about workplace safety while serving in his role as local chairman of the union and for reporting that a trainmaster had instructed him to operate a train in violation of certain Federal Railroad Administration rules in June 2009 near Fort Wayne, Ind. The railroad alleged that the conductor was terminated for failing to pass a locomotive engineer certification test. OSHA's order requires the railroad to provide the conductor with training and another opportunity to pass the test, and then upon his passing the test to reinstate his employment under the same terms and conditions as if he had passed the exam in 2009. Furthermore, the railroad must pay the conductor a total of $226,327.87, including back wages of $67,736.12, compensatory damages of $75,000, punitive damages of $75,000 and attorney's fees of $8,591.75. The respondents and the complainants have 30 days from receipt of these findings to file objections and to request a hearing before an administrative law judge. OSHA enforces the whistleblower provisions of the FRSA and 21 other statutes protecting employees who report violations of various airline, commercial motor carrier, consumer product, environmental, financial reform, food safety, health care reform, nuclear, pipeline, public transportation agency, maritime and securities laws. Employers are prohibited from retaliating against employees who raise various protected concerns or provide protected information to the employer or to the government. On July 16, OSHA and the U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Railroad Administration signed a memorandum of agreement to facilitate coordination and cooperation with enforcement of the FRSA's whistleblower provisions. Between 2007 and 2012 to date, OSHA received more than 900 whistleblower complaints under the FRSA. Almost 63 percent involved an allegation that a worker was retaliated against for reporting an on-the-job injury. Employees who believe that they have been retaliated against for engaging in protected conduct may file a complaint with the secretary of labor to request an investigation by OSHA's Whistleblower Protection Program. Detailed information on employee whistleblower rights, including fact sheets, is available at http://www.whistleblowers.gov . Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. OSHA's role is to ensure these conditions for America's working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education and assistance. For more information, visit http://www.osha.gov . Editor's note: The U.S. Department of Labor does not release the names of employees involved in whistleblower complaints."
"July 19, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20120719,US Labor Department's MSHA releases midyear mine fatality update,"ARLINGTON, Va. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration today released a midyear summary of mining deaths across the country. During the first half of 2012, 19 miners died in work-related accidents at the nation's mines. Among 10 coal mining deaths, three resulted from slips or falls, two from rib falls and one each from the following categories: exploding vessels under pressure, drowning, handling materials, machinery and electrical. An uncharacteristic trend identified is that five of these fatalities – three involving mine supervisors – occurred on five consecutive weekends. Among nine metal and nonmetal mining deaths, four were attributed to powered haulage incidents, two were the result of a falling face/rib/highwall, and one each was linked to an accident involving machinery, falling material and a person falling. ""While 19 is the second-lowest number of mining deaths recorded in mining midyear, we know that these deaths are preventable,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""Many mines operate every shift of every day, year in and year out, without a fatality or a lost-time injury. Mining workplaces can and must be made safe for all miners."" MSHA has taken a number of actions to identify mines with health and safety problems, and has initiated several outreach and enforcement initiatives, including ""Rules to Live By,"" a fatality prevention program highlighting the safety and health standards most frequently cited during fatal accident investigations. Fatalities can be prevented by using effective safety and health management programs in the workplace. Workplace examinations for hazards – pre-shift and on-shift, every shift – can identify and eliminate hazards that kill and injure miners. Effective and appropriate training positions miners to recognize and understand hazards and find ways to control or eliminate them. Furthermore, miners must be free to exercise their rights under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 and be full participants in maintaining a safe and healthful workplace. ""We believe these actions, along with initiatives by the mining industry, can make a positive difference,"" said Main. To review MSHA's analysis of mining fatalities that occurred during the first half of 2012, along with best practices to help mining operations avoid similar fatalities, visit the agency's website at http://www.msha.gov/fatals/summaries/summaries.asp . This information also has been provided directly to miners, mine operators and mine safety trainers."
"July 19, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ofccp/ofccp20120719,"US Labor Department settles charges of hiring discrimination
with federal contractor Leprino Foods","Agreement includes $550,000 in compensation for more than 250 job applicants who are African-American, of Asian or Hispanic descent LEMOORE, Calif. — The U.S. Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs has entered into a consent decree with Leprino Foods Inc. to resolve charges of systemic hiring discrimination at the company's Lemoore West facility. The consent decree, signed today by an administrative law judge with the Labor Department, settles OFCCP's allegations that Leprino Foods' use of a pre-employment test called WorkKeys to select hires for on-call laborer positions resulted in discrimination against African-American job applicants and applicants of Asian and Hispanic descent. ""I am pleased that we were able to reach a fair settlement in this matter,"" said OFCCP Director Patricia Shiu. ""While employers can and should hire the most qualified workers for the job, they cannot create artificial barriers to employment that unfairly block any individual from competing for good jobs."" OFCCP determined that Leprino Foods violated Executive Order 11246, which prohibits federal contractors and subcontractors from discriminating on the bases of race, color, religion, sex and national origin in their employment practices. The agency made its findings after a scheduled compliance review in which OFCCP investigators conducted interviews, analyzed company data and reviewed documents provided by the company. Through this review, OFCCP discovered that the administration of the WorkKeys exam had an adverse impact on minority job applicants for these specific positions. The agency further determined that the exam was not job-related, as it tested applicants' skills in mathematics, locating information and observation — skills that are not critical to the entry-level tasks performed by on-call laborers, such as inspecting products, monitoring equipment and maintaining sanitation at the facility. Under the terms of the consent decree, Leprino will pay $550,000 in back wages, interest and benefits to 253 minority workers who were rejected for on-call laborer positions between January 2005 and October 2006 because they failed the WorkKeys exam. Additionally, the company has agreed to discontinue use of the test for this purpose, hire at least 13 of the original class members, undertake extensive self-monitoring measures and immediately correct any discriminatory practices. Leprino Foods is one of the largest producers of mozzarella cheese in the world and is based in Denver, Colo. Since 2005, the company has received contracts totaling nearly $50 million from U.S. Department of Agriculture's Farm Services Agency to provide mozzarella and other dairy products to the federal government. In addition to Executive Order 11246, OFCCP enforces Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974. As amended, these three laws require those who do business with the federal government, both contractors and subcontractors, to follow the fair and reasonable standard that they not discriminate in employment on the basis of sex, race, color, religion, national origin, disability or status as a protected veteran.

"July 19, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20120719,US Labor Department to hold women’s retirement forum July 28 at University of Illinois-Chicago,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor’s Employee Benefits Security Administration will hold a free women’s retirement savings forum on Saturday, July 28, 10 a.m.–12:30 p.m. CDT, at the University of Illinois-Chicago, Student Center East Building, Illinois Room A, 750 S. Halsted St., Chicago, Ill. 60607. “What Every Woman Should Know About Retirement Savings and How to Make It Last” will be open to the public and the media. Women are more likely than men to leave and re-enter the workforce during the course of a career. Combined with a longer life expectancy, this reality can result in inadequate retirement savings. The forum is designed to help attendees overcome such challenges, understand what they can do now to increase their savings and learn what to guard against when they seek out investment advice. “For a host of reasons, women are more likely than men to have smaller savings or even no nest egg at all when heading into retirement. It’s a problem that can be made more severe since women tend to live longer than men,” said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Employee Benefits Security Phyllis C. Borzi. “It is important that both women and men saving for retirement have the information needed to prepare for a secure retirement and avoid potential pitfalls in the savings marketplace. We intend for this forum to be a helpful tool for those giving thought to how they will spend their golden years.” The event will feature panel discussions as well as remarks by Borzi; Hubert H. “Skip” Humphrey III, assistant director, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Office for Older Americans; Doug Nguyen, deputy regional communications director, Social Security Administration; Lara Hinz, director of programs, Women’s Institute for a Secure Retirement; and Joseph C. Peiffer, attorney and member, Public Investors Arbitration Bar Association. Christine Benz, director of personal finance for Morningstar, will moderate the forum. Additionally, free educational materials will be available to all attendees. Space is limited, and members of the public who wish to attend this forum must register in advance with Meredith Regine, who may be reached at regine.meredith.e@dol.gov or 202-693-8300.

"July 18, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20120718-1,"US Labor Department action results in order to restore half a million dollars to worker retirement plans sponsored by Columbus, Ohio-based company","COLUMBUS, Ohio – In a lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Labor that followed an investigation by its Employee Benefits Security Administration, a federal judge has ordered the president of Columbus-based Clark Graphics, Mary Clark, to restore $505,551.46 to the company’s two employee retirement plans. Additionally, Marcia Dowdell, the president of Pension Retirement Planning who served as administrator for the plans, has been ordered to restore funds to both plans. The department’s suit alleged insufficient oversight and mishandling of plan assets resulting in multiple violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Specifically, the suit alleged that Clark Graphics’ owners, Mary Clark, James Clark and Stephen Clark, failed in their fiduciary responsibilities as plan trustees by neglecting to monitor the actions of the plans’ administrator. They also failed to review and reconcile the plans’ trust account statements, review participant distribution calculations and require the administrator to issue participant statements. Finally, Dowdell failed to maintain accurate records for participants in both plans; consequently, some participants have not received the correct retirement benefits. “Employers that sponsor retirement plans have a fiduciary duty to monitor plan assets and ensure they are handled appropriately and protected,” said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Employee Benefits Security Phyllis C. Borzi. “Contracting with an outside firm to manage those assets does not absolve them of their legal responsibilities. Congress made it clear long ago that money set aside for retirement is much too important to mishandle, abuse or neglect, and enacted strict protections with respect to workers’ hard-earned savings.” The order requires the restoration of all plan losses for which the defendants are liable plus appropriate interest. Specifically, Mary Clark has been ordered to restore $142,797.23 to the Clark Graphics Defined Benefit Plan and $362,754.23 to the Clark Graphics Profit Sharing Plan. The judgment also permanently enjoins Mary and James Clark from serving as fiduciaries to any employee benefit plan subject to ERISA. Dowdell has been ordered to restore to the profit sharing plan a total of $425,586.73, less any payments made by other defendants. She also has been ordered to restore $142,797.23 less any payments made by other defendants, to the defined benefit plan. Additionally, Dowdell has been enjoined from serving as a fiduciary or service provider to any ERISA-covered plan in the future. Her company, Pension Retirement Planning, provided third-party record-keeping services to as many as 51 ERISA-covered pension plans during the decade leading up to 2010, when it ceased operations. “Employees should be assured that those who are entrusted with the assets of their retirement plans will be held accountable,” said L. Joe Rivers, director of EBSA’s Cincinnati Regional Office. “The Labor Department will continue to fight for workers when fiduciaries fail in their responsibilities to properly administer employee benefit plans.” EBSA’s Cincinnati office conducted the investigation and the case was litigated by the Labor Department’s regional solicitor in Chicago.

"July 18, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20120718-0,US Labor Department improves procedures for plan sponsors seeking relief under new fee disclosure rules,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor's Employee Benefits Security Administration has announced improved procedures for plan sponsors who wish to obtain fiduciary relief for a service provider’s failure to comply with the department’s plan-level fee disclosure rule. http://webapps.dol.gov/FederalRegister/HtmlDisplay.aspx?DocId=26218&AgencyId=8&DocumentType=2 The final “408(b)(2)” regulation (77 FR 5632, Feb. 3, 2012), effective on July 1, 2012, includes a provision to protect plan sponsors or other responsible plan fiduciaries from liability for a breach of their fiduciary duties under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) when, unbeknownst to the plan sponsor, a service provider failed to comply with the regulation’s comprehensive disclosure requirements. If a plan sponsor discovers that required information has not been furnished, the sponsor must notify the department, by regular mail or electronically, when efforts to obtain the undisclosed information from a service provider are not successful. The direct final rule continues to permit paper or electronic submissions, but enhances the existing procedures by providing a dedicated P.O. box address (U.S. Department of Labor, Employee Benefits Security Administration, Office of Enforcement, P.O. Box 75296, Washington, DC 20013) and a web-based tool, at https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ebsa/employers-and-advisers/plan-administration-and-compliance/fiduciary-responsibilities/fee-disclosure-failure-notice , that will assist plan sponsors in ensuring that all required information is submitted and providing immediate confirmation that notices have been received by the department. ""These revised submission procedures will help plan sponsors who, through no fault of their own, do not receive the disclosures promised to them by the 408(b)(2) regulation. When efforts to resolve the disclosure failure with their service provider are ineffective, plan sponsors will be able to take advantage of an easy-to-use, online tool that will guide them through the information that must be submitted to the department and provide immediate confirmation that their notice has been received. Of course, plan sponsors who wish to submit a paper notice may continue to do so,” said Assistant Secretary of Labor for EBSA Phyllis C. Borzi. “Department staff also will be able to more efficiently receive, process, and review these notices, which will in turn benefit the plan sponsors who seek relief.” Parties wishing to comment on this direct final amendment to the 408(b)(2) regulation may do so by August 15, 2012 in accordance with instructions provided in the direct final rule. Unless significant adverse comment is received, these revised procedures will be effective on September 14, 2012. U.S. Department of Labor news materials are accessible at www.dol.gov.

The act protects railroad employees from retaliation when they report safety violations, or work-related personal injuries or illnesses. Rail safety regulations are developed and enforced by the FRA in cooperation with rail stakeholders, including rail labor organizations. Through inspection, enforcement and education, the FRA plays a key role in rail safety, and railroads are among the safest modes of transportation for passengers and freight. The FRA has broad authority over rail safety but does not have direct authority to address whistleblower incidents. ""The safety of railroad employees depends on workers' ability to report injuries, incidents and hazards without fear of retaliation,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health Dr. David Michaels. ""OSHA welcomes the opportunity to work with the FRA to protect these rights and make our nation's railroads a safer place to work."" Whistleblower complaints in the railroad industry have been on the rise in recent years. Between 2007 and 2012, OSHA received more than 900 whistleblower complaints under the FRSA, and almost 63 percent involved an allegation that a worker was retaliated against for reporting an on-the-job injury. The memorandum establishes procedures for the agencies to follow for whistleblower complaints. Under the agreement, the FRA will refer railroad employees who complain of alleged retaliation to OSHA. OSHA will provide the FRA with copies of the complaints it receives under the FRSA's whistleblower provision, as well as any findings and preliminary orders that OSHA issues. The agencies will jointly develop training to assist FRA enforcement staff in recognizing complaints of retaliation, and to assist OSHA enforcement staff in recognizing potential violations of railroad safety regulations revealed during whistleblower investigations. FRA and OSHA also sent a joint letter to railroad and transportation associations that expresses the agencies' commitment to working together to ensure that injury/illness reporting is as accurate and consistent as possible. The letter highlights troubling railroad reporting trends and provides concrete ways that the associations' member organizations can improve workplace safety and improve compliance with federal regulations. ""This memorandum is a watershed moment for both railroads and labor alike,"" said FRA Administrator Joseph Szabo. He continued, ""Securing a process that protects employees who report safety violations is critical to maintaining safety standards in the workplace."" The memorandum is available at http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=MOU&p_id=1125 .

"July 16, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20120716,MSHA Assistant Secretary Main addresses concerns of aggregate associations,"FLORENCE , Ky. – In remarks today in Florence before representatives of several Midwest state aggregate associations, Assistant Secretary of Labor for Mine Safety and Health Joseph A. Main outlined a number of important initiatives and reforms his agency has undertaken over the last two years. Since his appointment in October 2009, Main has placed the U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration on an aggressive path to improve overall conditions for miners. The disaster that killed 29 miners at the Upper Big Branch Mine in April 2010, however, changed everything. ""It unquestionably shook the very foundation of mine safety and health, and caused all of us to take a deeper look at the weaknesses in the safety net expected to protect the nation's miners,"" said Main. ""There has been an intense examination of that tragedy, and MSHA and the industry have undergone significant change as we have sought to find and fix deficiencies in mine safety and health."" Actions by MSHA and some in the mining industry have resulted in positive change, and Main pointed to a number of specific improvements. For example, in 2011 MSHA inspected approximately 14,170 mines and issued 157,613 citations and orders – an 8 percent decline in issuances from 2010, during which MSHA issued 170,909 citations and orders. The number of significant and substantial, known as S&S, citations and orders (those contributing to a safety or health hazard that is likely to result in a reasonably serious injury or illness), dropped 12 percent from 2010 to 2011. In 2011, 37 miners died on the job, the second-lowest number since statistics first were recorded in 1900. With a cautionary note, Main added, ""We all know that one death is one too many, and mining deaths are preventable."" MSHA also has increased its emphasis on health issues, noted Main, including the need for mine operators to monitor their employees' exposure to harmful air contaminants by conducting dust, gas, mist and fume surveys to determine the adequacy of control measures. ""Effective exposure monitoring can identify unhealthful levels of contaminants and assist in preventing disease,"" said Main. He discussed changes and improvements in MSHA's Small Mine Consultation Program to make it more efficient and able to work more closely with state aggregate associations. ""An important goal is to locate needed resources and help small mine operators understand and comply with the law,"" Main said. Finally, he outlined several initiatives in which MSHA, aggregate associations and other stakeholders have collaborated to advance the health and safety of miners related to guarding, fall protection, and improvements in enforcement consistency and compliance. The following initiatives are among those Main discussed: Enhanced enforcement: Following the Upper Big Branch Mine disaster, MSHA initiated its impact inspection program targeting mines that merit increased attention and enforcement due to poor compliance records. From April 2010 through May 2012, MSHA conducted 452 impact inspections at mines, resulting in 8,106 citations, 811 orders and 32 safeguards for a total of 8,949 issuances. Compliance has improved at mines receiving impact inspections: Since September 2010, violations per inspection hour are down 13 percent S&S violation rates are down 21 percent, 104(d) orders are down 43 percent and the total lost-time injury rate is down 13 percent. Under MSHA's Pattern of Violations program , mines are screened to determine if they have met the potential POV criteria. If they do, they are required to make compliance improvements to avoid POV closure orders when S&S violations are found. MSHA has strengthened the criteria for POV and, since November 2010, has placed two mines on a POV, marking the first time in the history of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act that mines successfully have been subject to a POV closure order. In 2011, eight mines were issued potential POV notices, down from 17 in 2010. A review of 14 mines that received potential POV notices in 2010 indicated that the total violation rate is down 23 percent, the S&S violation rate is down 42 percent, the rate of 104(d) withdrawal orders is down 64 percent and the lost-time injury rate down is 44 percent. MHSA also has created a new online tool that can track whether a specific mine meets potential POV criteria. ""Rules to Live By"": This multiphase initiative, which includes education and training, focuses on the most common causes of mining deaths and the standards cited most often in mining death investigations. Guarding: In 2010, MSHA published the guide ""Guarding Conveyor Belts at Metal and Nonmetal Mines"" on its website to help eliminate violations. Guarding-related citations and orders are down 39 percent from 2010. A sequel to this guide, which will provide detailed compliance information on all types of equipment guarding other than conveyor belts, will be released soon. Fall protection: In June, MSHA published a program policy letter clarifying compliance with the fall protection standard. The policy recognizes that, in many cases, OSHA's standard on unprotected sides and edges would satisfy MSHA's standard. However, the policy also provides that MSHA will evaluate (on a case-by-case basis) ""all work area hazards to ensure appropriate fall protection provisions are in place to protect miners from fall hazards."" Pre-assessment conferencing: This process was implemented in MSHA districts where resources permit and allows disputes to be resolved before they are contested and added to the backlog of contested cases. Mine emergency preparedness: MSHA, working with its stakeholders, has made significant progress in developing technologies to aid in mine rescue, improving command and control capabilities, and increasing mine emergency response. Consistency in mine inspections: MSHA has improved oversight of the inspection program and consistency in the enforcement of the Mine Act with a new training program for all field office supervisors. All supervisors have received the training to date and will receive re-training every two years. A half-day course on professionalism and consistency has been added to the two-week refresher training for each metal and nonmetal mine inspector. Corrective actions for improving MSHA's effectiveness: An internal review of MSHA's actions in the months leading up to the Upper Big Branch Mine disaster has resulted in the initiation of several corrective actions, including a comprehensive review of agency directives and guidance, a complete overhaul of policy directives, increased oversight of MSHA programs and further training of MSHA personnel. ""Improving mine safety and instilling a culture of prevention in the industry is of great importance to President Obama, Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis and me,"" said Main. ""The secretary has articulated a forward-looking vision of ensuring good jobs for every worker in the United States, which includes safe and healthy workplaces – particularly in high-risk industries – and a voice in the workplace for all workers."""

The complaints also seek injunctions and cash performance bonds from each mine operator to guarantee that future penalties will be paid. ""Over a period of several years, these employers either reneged on promises to pay these penalties or they failed to contest them and then chose to ignore them. Mine operators cannot be permitted to violate mine safety laws and simply refuse to pay the penalties assessed for those violations,"" said Michael Felsen, the department's regional solicitor of labor for New England. ""The Department of Labor will use all the tools available, including litigation in federal court, to pursue these scofflaws.""

Inc.'s P-1 Mine in Harlan County, Ky., for four violations. The proposed penalties were assessed as a result of an investigation into the June 2011 death of a miner who was fatally injured when a large section of rock fell from the underground coal mine's wall, or rib, and knocked him into a dolly. Although there were no witnesses to the accident, federal accident investigators believe that the continuous haulage system backed up during the mining process, causing the dolly to move along the conveyer belt structure and drag the victim, David A. Partin, from beneath the fallen material. MSHA determined that the accident occurred because the mine operator failed to support or control the ribs to protect the miner on one of its mechanized mining units, or MMUs. Additionally, the operator failed to conduct adequate pre-shift and on-shift examinations, and ignored the hazardous rib conditions on the MMU. Finally, the operator failed to revise and upgrade the roof control plan to address changing geological conditions that had occurred on the MMU. The agency has proposed penalties for one violation at $70,000 and three flagrant violations at $174,700 each. A flagrant violation is defined as a reckless or repeated failure to make reasonable efforts to eliminate a known violation of a mandatory safety and health standard that substantially and proximately caused, or reasonably could have been expected to cause, death or serious bodily injury. Flagrant violations, which were established under the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006, may be assessed a maximum civil penalty of $220,000 each. ""Dozens of miners are injured by rib and roof falls every year and, tragically, some are killed,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""The accident investigation found that, had the mine operator properly secured the mine's ribs and revised its roof control plan to address changing geologic conditions, this tragedy might have been averted."" Last month, MSHA launched its annual Preventive Roof Rib Outreach Program, an educational initiative designed to alert miners and mine operators about the dangers of roof and rib falls, as well as the methods for thoroughly checking and addressing hazardous roof and rib conditions. The mine operator has contested all of the violations related to the June 2011 fatality. MSHA's accident investigation report is available at http://www.msha.gov/FATALS/2011/FTL11c09.asp ."
"July 12, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20120712,BP agrees to pay more than $13 million and abate violations in settlement agreement with US Department of Labor,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration today announced that OSHA and BP Products North America Inc. have resolved 409 of the 439 citations issued by the agency in October 2009 for willful violations of OSHA's process safety management standard at BP's refinery in Texas City, Texas. Under the agreement, BP will pay $13,027,000 in penalties, and already has abated or will abate all existing violations by the end of 2012. ""Protecting workers and saving lives is the ultimate goal of this agreement,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""For the workers at BP's Texas City refinery, this settlement will help establish a culture of safety. The workers who help keep our nation's oil and gas industries running deserve to go to work each day without fear of losing their lives."" In September 2005, OSHA cited BP for a then-record $21 million as a result of the explosion at its Texas City refinery that killed 15 workers in March of that year. Upon issuance of the citations, the parties entered into an agreement that required BP to identify and correct deficiencies. In a 2009 follow-up investigation to evaluate BP's performance under the 2005 agreement, OSHA found that although BP had made improvements at the plant, the company had failed to correct a number of items, which led OSHA to issue 270 failure-to-abate notices. In a 2010 settlement, BP agreed to pay a penalty of $50.6 million to resolve those notices. Also in 2009, OSHA cited BP for 439 willful violations of the agency's PSM standard, including failing to follow industry-accepted engineering practices for pressure relief safety systems. Those citations carried total proposed penalties of $30.7 million. Under today's agreement, all violations covered in this settlement have been corrected or will be corrected by Dec. 31, 2012, using the procedures established under the 2010 agreement. Under the 2010 agreement with OSHA, independent third-party experts provided oversight of BP processes for relief and safety instrumented system evaluation, as well as quarterly progress reports on BP's activity. The 2010 agreement also required BP to hire independent experts to monitor BP's efforts and obligated the company to allocate $500 million to ensure safety at the Texas City refinery. Of the 439 October 2009 willful citations, all but 30 are settled by this agreement. The breakdown of the citation settlement is as follows: BP accepted 57 willful and 31 serious citations as issued; 61 original willful citations have been grouped as 34 repeat citations; 150 willful citations have been grouped as 92 unclassified citations; 110 citations have been withdrawn by OSHA; and 30 unresolved citations have been grouped as 22 unresolved citations and remain under contest, and will be litigated or settled in the future. The 110 citations were withdrawn because BP provided additional documentation after the citations were issued, showing several pieces of equipment originally cited were not covered by the PSM standard, were out of service at the time of the inspection or met the applicable Recognized and Generally Accepted Good Engineering Practices requirements. BP's documentation was reviewed and verified by OSHA and independent third-party experts. RAGAGEP is a safety concept set forth in OSHA's PSM standard that requires employers covered by the standard to operate potentially hazardous facilities using good engineering practices accepted by their industry. The 30 unresolved violations, which were grouped in the settlement as 22 citations, address BP's failure to protect certain pressure relief valves in accordance with RAGAGEP. ""Make no mistake, the scope of this agreement should send a clear signal that OSHA is committed to ensuring BP takes seriously the safety and health of America's most important natural resource – its workers,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health Dr. David Michaels. OSHA's evaluation of working conditions at this refinery was conducted by the agency's Houston South Area Office. To read today's agreement, visit http://www.osha.gov/dep/bp/FINALEXECUTEDSettlement.pdf . For a timeline on OSHA's actions regarding BP, visit http://www.osha.gov/dep/bp/bp.html . Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. OSHA's role is to ensure these conditions for America's working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education and assistance.

An investigation by the department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration found that the fund’s trustees made loans to participants that were improper, unsecured and allowed to become delinquent. Pursuant to the consent order, the amount of the improper loans – totaling more than $1.7 million – will be subject to corrected loan documentation, repaid by plan participants or treated as taxable distributions. “Plan fiduciaries have a special obligation to maintain the integrity of the plan for the purpose of ensuring future retirement income. Allowing participants to withdraw plan assets without regard to ERISA’s safeguards violates that basic principle,” said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Employee Benefits Security Phyllis C. Borzi. “Our legal action underscores the Labor Department’s commitment to hold accountable those who are entrusted with the assets of employee benefit plans.” David Fensler and Anthony Monaco, as trustees to the fund, allegedly approved at least 194 improper loans from the fund to individual participants between January 1997 and Dec. 31, 2009. As of that date, none of the loans approved by the trustees had been paid back to the fund in full, and only six of the participants had ever made any payments on loans issued to them. Fensler and Monaco allegedly made no effort to enforce the terms of the loan documents or collect payments, in violation of the plan’s governing documents and ERISA. Under the terms of the consent order, the fund’s trustees will correct all prohibited transactions in which they engaged since August 2008 and will ensure that all loans meet all the requirements of ERISA and the IRC going forward. Specifically, the plan’s governing documents will be amended to include requirements that a participant must demonstrate and document an emergency need before he or she can receive a loan from the fund. In addition, the fund will issue an Internal Revenue Service Form 1099 at the end of the plan year for the full unpaid loan, in the event a loan is delinquent for more than 120 days. For all loans issued after Aug. 30, 2008, the fund will issue a notification to the participant within 45 days that the individual will receive a Form 1099 for plan year 2012 for the outstanding loan balance plus any outstanding interest in accordance with IRC rules. The United Employee Benefit Fund was established by the Professional Workers Master Contract Group and the National Production Workers Union Local 707 to provide welfare, medical, death, disability and child care facility benefits to the fund’s participants. As of Dec. 31, 2009, the fund had approximately 281 participants. The suit resulted from an investigation by EBSA’s Chicago Regional Office and was litigated by the department’s Regional Office of the Solicitor in Chicago. For help with problems related to private sector retirement and health plans, employers and workers can reach EBSA’s Chicago office at 312-353-0900 or toll-free at 866-444-3272.

$2.3 million in back wages to temporary foreign agricultural workers","Agreement provides record back wage amount for H-2A program, plus $500,000 penalty SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Yerington, Nev.-based onion grower Peri & Sons has agreed to pay a record total of $2,338,700 in back wages to 1,365 workers, along with a civil money penalty of $500,000, for violations under the H-2A program. U.S. Department of Labor Administrative Law Judge Steven Berlin in San Francisco signed the order granting the consent findings. ""We are pleased to have reached this record agreement to pay workers the wages and expenses they are due,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""In order for the H-2A program to operate as intended, all employers must comply with the law."" An investigation by the department's Wage and Hour Division determined that workers employed by Peri & Sons involved in irrigation, as well as harvesting, packing and shipping onions sold in grocery stores nationwide, were not paid properly for work performed. All of the workers came to the U.S. from Mexico under the H-2A temporary agricultural worker visa program. In most cases, their earnings fell below the hourly wage required by the program, as well as below the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour for a brief period of time. Investigators also found that workers were not paid for time spent in mandatory pesticide training or reimbursed for subsistence expenses while traveling to and from the U.S. Additionally, their return transportation costs at the end of the contract period were not paid, as was required. The H-2A temporary agricultural worker program establishes a means for employers who anticipate a shortage of domestic workers to bring nonimmigrant foreign workers to the United States to perform temporary or seasonal agricultural work. The employer must file an application stating that a sufficient number of domestic workers are not available and the employment of these workers will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of similarly employed workers in the U.S. Employers using the H-2A program must meet a number of specific conditions relating to recruitment, wages, housing, meals and transportation. More information about H-2A requirements is available at http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs26a.htm .

""We have seen 28 straight months of private sector job growth, during which time our economy has added back close to 4.4 million private sector jobs, with nearly one million jobs added this year. We have added an average of 150,000 private sector jobs per month in 2012, continuing at the same steady pace as last year and with jobs being created across all sectors and regions of the country. Gross domestic product growth has now been positive for 11 consecutive quarters. We remain on a path toward stable and durable growth. ""We continue to face headwinds from the threat of recession in Europe, our largest trading partner. Though less demand from across the ocean could present challenges for our exporters as they work to create jobs here at home, U.S. exports to the European Union in the first quarter of the year were at the highest level since 1997. Also, fortunately, there are signs that European leaders are moving away from an austerity approach and toward stabilization and growth strategies that will have a positive impact on our own recovery and ease concerns at home. ""I'm encouraged by several developments here at home that will reduce uncertainty and help put more Americans back to work. Passage of a bipartisan highway bill shows Congress can work together to boost hiring in the construction sector. Approval of student loan relief will help more people finish their education and get the skills to make them employable in today's competitive labor market. And the Supreme Court's health care ruling will allow businesses to plan long-term strategies that will lead to more healthy workers who are critical to a healthy economy. ""This administration continues to work to promote the return of good jobs back to American communities. As wages spike in countries like China, more companies are discovering a cost advantage of bringing manufacturing jobs back to the United States. That's why it's so important for Congress to encourage this in-sourcing trend and pass legislation to provide incentives for companies to bring jobs home and embrace the Made in the USA' label. ""While the private sector is creating jobs and corporate profits have never been higher, a big drag on our economy is the continued layoffs of teachers, firefighters and police officers. We should embrace the president's proposal to put these Americans back to work, while giving additional tax cuts to small businesses that are key contributors to job creation."""

"July 5, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20120705,"National Rural Electric Cooperative Association agrees to restore $27.3 million to benefit plans, settling US Labor Department claims","ARLINGTON, Va. ‒ The National Rural Electric Cooperative Association agreed to restore $27,272,727 to three association-sponsored employee benefit plans covered by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. This agreement follows an investigation by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Employee Benefits Security Administration that found the association selected itself as a service provider to the plans, determined its own compensation and made payments to itself that exceeded NRECA’s direct expenses in providing services to the plans, in violation of ERISA. “Workers should be able to have confidence that their hard-earned retirement savings are being properly managed,” said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. “This settlement benefits tens of thousands of NRECA plan participants by reducing their plan administration costs.” Under the terms of the agreement, NRECA will not provide administrative services to the NRECA Retirement Security Plan, the NRECA 401(k) Plan and the NRECA Group Benefits Plan without entering into a written contract or agreement with the plans that must be approved by an independent fiduciary. The independent fiduciary must determine whether the use of NRECA to provide administrative services to the plans is prudent and reasonable, determine the categories of direct expenses that NRECA may charge to the plans and the methods of calculating those expenses, and monitor NRECA’s compliance with certain terms of the agreement. The agreement also provides that during a 60-month period following the implementation date, NRECA shall discount the amount of permissible direct expenses for which it seeks reimbursement from all three plans in the amount of $22,727,272. The balance of the settlement payment, $4,545,455, already has been paid directly to the NRECA 401(k) Plan. “This settlement sends a clear message to plan fiduciaries that they cannot profit from selecting themselves to provide services to plans,” said Phyllis Borzi, assistant secretary of labor for employee benefits security. In addition to the amounts returned to the plans, NRECA will pay $2,727,276 in civil penalties. Headquartered in Arlington, NRECA is a nonprofit trade association for electric power cooperatives. The sponsored plans are open to members of the trade association as well as the association’s employees. As of 2010, the latest information available, the NRECA 401(k) Plan had 68,970 participants, the NRECA Retirement Security Plan had 64,286 participants and the NRECA Group Benefits Plan had 73,644 participants. The settlement follows an investigation by EBSA’s Washington District Office. Employers and workers can contact that office at 202-693-8700 or toll-free at 866-444-3272 for help with problems relating to private sector pension and health plans.

"July 2, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/vets/vets20120702,"US Labor Department announces more than $20 million in grants to provide job training for more than 11,000 homeless veterans","WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor today awarded 90 grants totaling more than $20 million to fund job training and support services that will help more than 11,000 veterans succeed in civilian careers. The grants are being awarded through the department's Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program. ""Americans who have served their country should not find themselves without a home,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""The grants announced today will help these heroes find good jobs and take us one step closer to the goal of ending veteran homelessness altogether."" The grants announced today are second- and third-year awards to state and local workforce investment boards, local public agencies and nonprofit organizations – including faith-based and community organizations – that demonstrated satisfactory performance during the past year. All 90 grants are awarded through the HVRP program, with some of the grants specifically set aside to serve formerly incarcerated veterans, and homeless female veterans and veterans with families. The grant recipients are familiar with the areas and populations they are serving. Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program grants provide occupational, classroom and on-the-job training, as well as job search and placement assistance, including follow-up services. Grantees are expected to maximize available assistance and find good jobs for veterans by coordinating efforts and resources with the U.S. departments of Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development, and Health and Human Services, as well as other national, state and local agencies in accordance with the VA's five-year plan to end homelessness for veterans and their families. In June, Secretary Solis announced the award of 64 grants through the Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program. Those grants – which are separate from the 90 receiving funds today – are first-year awards totaling more than $15 million and aimed at providing about 8,600 homeless veterans nationwide with job training.

"June 28, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20120628,"US Labor Department announces more than $12 million in grants to provide job training, employment services for formerly incarcerated women and girls","WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor today awarded a total of $12,096,172 in grants to nine nonprofit organizations across the country to provide critical employment and support services for previously incarcerated female adults and youth as they make the transition back into their communities. ""This is a great opportunity for these women and girls to turn their lives around,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""These federal grants will help them obtain the job training and support services they need to positively contribute to their communities and their families."" Seven grantees have been selected to work with adults and two to work with youth. The funds will be used to provide services including job training that leads to credentials in high-demand industries; employment preparation; mentoring; supportive services such as housing, and substance abuse and mental health treatment; family counseling; and assistance with parenting and child reunification. Providing guidance and support in addition to job training gives previously incarcerated women the stability necessary to improve their educational and employment outcomes, including increasing high school graduation rates, improving literacy and math skills, and entering college and/or other postsecondary training and employment. Reintegrating formerly incarcerated individuals is a government-wide effort supported by the Federal Interagency Re-entry Council. Chaired by the U.S. Department of Justice, the council brings together numerous federal agencies to advance policies and programs to make communities safer and assist individuals returning to communities from prison or jail in becoming productive, taxpaying citizens. According to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports, women accounted for 25.5 percent of all arrests in 2010, including 19.5 percent of arrests for violent crime and 37.6 percent of arrests for property crimes. Over the past 10 years, arrests of men declined by 6.8 percent while arrests of women increased by 10.5 percent.

Worldwide, an estimated 60 percent of children who work do so in the agricultural sector. The USDA's 2011 Guidelines for Eliminating Child and Forced Labor in Agricultural Supply Chainslay out the key elements ofeffective company programs to reduce the likelihood that child or forced labor is used in agricultural products or commodities imported into the United States. Prospective applicants must represent a partnership that includes a nongovernmental organization and a company that is active in agricultural supply chains. Applicants must demonstrate expertise in areas such as international children's issues, labor issues and company supply chain compliance programs. The project funded as a result of this competition will involve piloting a program for one or more companies to reduce child labor (and forced labor if applicable) in an agricultural supply chain in one country. In addition, the projects will involve documenting lessons learned and recommendations for future application of the USDA's guidelines. Eligible applicants must respond to the entire scope of work outlined in the solicitation. Applications must be submitted by Aug. 20 at 5 p.m. EDT electronically via http://www.grants.gov or as hard copies to the U.S. Department of Labor, Procurement Services Center, 200 Constitution Ave. NW, Room S-4307, Washington, D.C. 20210, Attention: Brenda White and Jim Kinslow.

"June 27, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20120627,MSHA announces results of May impact inspections,"ARLINGTON, Va. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration today announced that federal inspectors issued 158 citations, 26 orders and three safeguards during special impact inspections conducted at nine coal mines last month. In a separate two-day inspection blitz, MSHA inspectors targeted 40 underground coal mines formerly owned by Massey Energy, where they issued 225 violations. The incident that precipitated these inspections was a burned conveyer belt at Road Fork No. 51 Mine in Wyoming County, W.Va. No similar violations were found during the subsequent 40 inspections. The monthly impact inspections, which began in force in April 2010 following the explosion at the Upper Big Branch Mine, involve mines that merit increased agency attention and enforcement due to their poor compliance history or particular compliance concerns, including high numbers of violations or closure orders; frequent hazard complaints or hotline calls; plan compliance issues; inadequate workplace examinations; a high number of accidents, injuries or illnesses; fatalities; and adverse conditions such as increased methane liberation, faulty roof conditions and inadequate ventilation. As an example from last month, MSHA conducted an impact inspection on May 16 at K and D Mining Inc.'s Mine No. 17 in Harlan County, Ky. MSHA personnel arrived at the mine during the second shift, capturing the phones to ensure that no advance notice of their presence was given. Among 43 violations issued were 16 unwarrantable failure withdrawal orders. Inspectors found that the continuous mining machine was operating with the ventilation curtain rolled up and a 60-foot-deep visible cloud of dust. Water pressure on the machine was inadequate, and several sprays were inoperative. Withdrawal orders also were issued for other hazardous conditions, including accumulations of combustible materials on conveyer belts, defective and stuck belt rollers, a nonpermissible pump starter in the return air shaft, and inadequate electrical and on-shift examinations. Such a confluence of hazards can create conditions that lead to methane and coal dust explosions. The mine was shut down for nine days after the inspection until the operator corrected all of the hazardous conditions. ""Mine operators know full well the consequences that occur when these kinds of conditions exist, and we cannot and will not tolerate this type of noncompliance that endangers miners' lives and leads to potentially disastrous results,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""What goes on at some of these mines when MSHA is not there is of great concern and likely would not be detected if it were not for the special tactics MSHA employs."" K and D Mining Inc.'s Mine No. 17 was not the only mine inspectors found to be exhibiting serious violations. On May 2, MSHA personnel conducted an impact inspection at Pay Car Mining Inc.'s No. 58 mine in McDowell County, W.Va., during the evening shift. The inspection party secured the mine's phones to prevent advance notice of the inspection. MSHA issued nine citations, one unwarrantable failure citation and six unwarrantable failure orders. This impact inspection was the mine's second, and the mine also had been issued a notice for a potential pattern of violations in November 2011. The mine subsequently implemented a corrective action program and met the target criteria, and it continues to be monitored by MSHA for a potential POV. During the May inspection, inspectors found that the mine operator failed to follow an approved mine ventilation plan on two working sections. Although the mine has a history of methane liberation, MSHA's inspection team found insufficient ventilation in two mine entries, the last open crosscut of one mining mechanized unit section, and the working faces and last open crosscut of another such section. The operator was issued five unwarrantable failure orders when no air movement could be measured using calibrated anemometers and, in one instance, the blades of the anemometer reversed, indicating that the ventilation was flowing in the wrong direction. Also, in the area where a continuous mining machine was operating, inspectors found that the ventilation line curtain rolled up to the mine roof, and 18 feet of curtain across the break were missing. Ventilation to another working face was not provided because 27 feet of curtain were missing. Additional citations were issued for inadequate roof control, faulty electrical equipment and a conveyor belt, and accumulations of combustible materials. These egregious working conditions exposed miners to potential illnesses associated with black lung and other respiratory diseases, as well as serious injury or death from fire and explosion hazards. Since April 2010, MSHA has conducted 452 impact inspections, which have resulted in a total of 8,106 citations, 811 orders and 32 safeguards Editor's note : A spreadsheet containing the results of impact inspections in May 2012 accompanies this news release.

""This additional federal funding will enable American Samoa to continue providing training and re-employment services to the workers who assisted with the cleanup and recovery efforts after the worst disaster in American Samoa's history,"" said Jane Oates, assistant secretary of labor for employment and training. ""The services provided through this grant will help these hardworking individuals find permanent employment."" The Labor Department approved a grant of up to $24,857,608 to the American Samoa Department of Human Resources on Oct. 19, 2009, with $8,285,870 released initially, to fund temporary jobs for individuals to assist with cleanup and recovery efforts. On April 21, 2010, incremental funding of $16,571,738 from the same grant was awarded to continue funding the temporary jobs as well as to provide workforce development services to the workers to help them transition to unsubsidized employment once the cleanup jobs ended. The jobs have now ended. Today's supplemental funding to continue services brings the total funds awarded to date to $25,357,608.

"June 26, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20120626,US Department of Labor announces $1.8 million in grants to support women in nontraditional occupations,"WASHINGTON – Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis today announced awards of $1.8 million in grants to consortia in six states through the Women in Apprenticeship and Nontraditional Occupations program. ""Apprenticeship programs are effective pipelines into growing industries. But too often, these programs are not as accessible to women. The federal grants announced today will better connect women with apprenticeships, helping them to gain skills in fields that offer long-term career opportunities,"" said Secretary Solis. The grants will support innovative projects that improve the recruitment, hiring, training, employment and retention of women in apprenticeships in industries such as advanced manufacturing, transportation and construction. Within these industries, the grants will fund activities focused on three occupational areas: existing occupations expected to experience primarily an increase in employment demand, existing occupations with significant changes to work and worker requirements, and new and emerging green occupations. The six grantees are community-based organizations, each of which has formed a consortium with a local Workforce Investment Area and at least one Registered Apprenticeship program sponsor. This consortium-based approach is intended to ensure that women served by WANTO grants have access to a range of supportive services and training, as well as to specific nontraditional employment opportunities. Each grantee will be required to place at least 50 participants annually and at least 100 participants over the life of the two-year grant into a Registered Apprenticeship program. The grants are jointly administered by the Labor Department's Women's Bureau and its Employment and Training Administration's Office of Apprenticeship.

"June 25, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20120625,"US Labor Departments OSHA fines 4 contractors more than $460,000 for exposing workers to falls, other safety hazards at Jersey City, NJ, construction site","JERSEY CITY, N.J. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration has cited four New Jersey contractors working on a 20-story building in Jersey City for exposing workers to fall hazards following a December 2011 inspection during which inspectors observed employees working on the fourth floor without personal fall protection or fall protection systems. Altura Concrete Inc. and Nathil Corp., both of Hasbrouck Heights, and White Diamonds Properties LLC and Blade Contracting Inc., both of Jersey City, face total proposed fines of $463,350. ""Year after year, falls remain the leading cause of death in the construction industry, accounting for almost one in every three construction worker deaths,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health Dr. David Michaels. ""We know how to prevent falls, and employers have a clear responsibility to provide the right equipment and procedures. When working at heights, everyone needs to plan ahead to get the job done safely, provide the right equipment and train workers to use the equipment safely. OSHA's message is simple: Safety pays and falls cost."" Altura Concrete, Inc. and Nathil Corp., the concrete contractors for the foundation and superstructure of the building, directed 75 employees on-site. The two companies have been cited for five willful violations – including four instance-by-instance (that is, egregious) violations – for failing to protect workers from fall hazards created by open sides and edges on the fourth, sixth, seventh, eighth, 10th and 13th floors, as well as protect workers from fall hazards created by the misuse of self-supporting stepladders. A willful violation is one committed with intentional knowing or voluntary disregard for the law's requirements, or with plain indifference to worker safety and health. The citations carry $315,000 in penalties. The companies also have received citations for nine serious violations, including failing to provide personal protective equipment, provide a cap for an acetylene tank in storage, store cylinders in an upright position, separate oxygen and acetylene tanks, provide fall protection for workers installing ribs, provide protection from protruding rebar, maintain shoring/reshoring plans on-site, provide railings on stairs, protect workers from fall hazards created by open holes, secure the cover over a floor hole and mark the floor hole cover. The citations carry $40,500 in penalties. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known. One other-than-serious violation has been cited for failing to record an injury on the OSHA 300 log. The citation carries a $900 penalty. An other-than-serious violation is one that has a direct relationship to job safety and health, but probably would not cause death or serious physical harm. General contractor White Diamonds Properties, with seven employees on-site, has been issued citations for two willful violations involving failing to protect workers from fall hazards, as well as citations for five serious violations related to improper storage of compressed gas cylinders, unprotected rebar and failing to have drawings for shoring/reshoring on-site. The citations carry $95,400 in penalties. Masonry contractor Blade Contracting, with 21 employees on-site, has been cited with three serious violations for failing to protect workers from fall hazards, properly use a scaffold and inspect scaffold components for defects. The citations carry $11,550 in penalties. ""A project of this magnitude clearly needs an aggressive injury and illness prevention plan in place to prevent falls and other hazards,"" said Robert Kulick, OSHA's regional administrator in New York. ""When management and workers together proactively identify and eliminate hazardous conditions, workers are better protected."" In April, Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis announced a new campaign to provide employers and workers with lifesaving information and educational materials about working safely from ladders, scaffolds and roofs in an effort to prevent deadly falls in the construction industry. In 2010, more than 10,000 construction workers were injured as a result of falling while working from heights, and more than 250 workers were killed. OSHA's fall prevention campaign was developed in partnership with the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health and NIOSH's National Occupational Research Agenda program.

"June 25, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20120625,Kentucky coal operator ordered to reinstate miner to job,"Administrative law judge increases penalty proposed by MSHA ARLINGTON, Va. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration today announced that an administrative law judge with the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission has ordered Cumberland River Coal Co. to reinstate miner Charles Howard to his former job and pay a civil penalty of $30,000, increasing MSHA's original proposed penalty of $20,000. Howard, who worked at Band Mill No. 2 Mine in Letcher County, Ky., suffered head injuries on the job in June 2010 and was discharged almost immediately upon his return the following May. Howard filed a complaint of discrimination with MSHA, alleging that he was fired for engaging in activity protected by the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 on numerous occasions beginning in April 2007. Section 105(c)(2) of the Mine Act states that a miner cannot be discharged, discriminated against or interfered with in the exercise of his statutory rights because he has filed a complaint regarding a health or safety violation. MSHA initiated an investigation, and upon finding merit to the complaint, filed the case with the review commission. According to court documents, Cumberland River Coal Co. refused to allow Howard to return to his job after being released to return to work by his treating physician. Instead, the mine operator sought the supplemental opinion of a doctor who, after changing his mind from his earlier diagnosis, determined that Howard could not return to work. ""There is no suggestion that Howard was terminated due to poor work performance and there was no incident that would have justified his termination,"" wrote Administrative Law Judge Margaret A. Miller. ""The only difficulty that [the mine operator] had with Howard was the fact that he continued to make safety complaints and continued to contact MSHA. Finally, not only was there open hostility against Howard, he was treated differently than other miners who had suffered a work-related injury."" ""Among the most critical provisions of the Mine Act – and one of my top priorities – is the protection of miners against retaliation for raising health and safety concerns,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""This decision represents a victory not only for Mr. Howard but for all miners who speak out about hazardous conditions."""
"June 25, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ofccp/ofccp20120625,Baldor Electric to pay $2 million to settle hiring discrimination case with US Labor Department,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs today announced that Baldor Electric Co. has agreed to settle allegations of systemic discrimination stemming from the company's applicant screening process at its facility in Fort Smith, Ark. OFCCP investigators determined that the process violated Executive Order 11246 by creating a disparate impact on women and minorities. As a result, 795 qualified women, African-Americans and job seekers of Asian and Hispanic descent were denied the opportunity to advance to the interview stage when applying for production and laborer positions. ""I am pleased with this settlement, which reflects a mutual commitment between the Department of Labor and the leadership of Baldor to ensure that all workers have a fair and equal shot at competing for good jobs,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""Our shared goal is to create lasting change so that anyone who comes looking for work at Baldor can be sure that discrimination will never be a factor in determining who gets the job."" Under the terms of the conciliation agreement negotiated by OFCCP, Baldor will pay a total of $2 million in back wages and interest to the affected individuals and will make at least 50 job offers to members of the original class as positions become available. The company also has agreed to undertake extensive self-monitoring measures to ensure that all hiring practices fully comply with the law, including record-keeping requirements. ""Discrimination is preventable when employers have certain processes in place and see to it that they are followed,"" said OFCCP Director Patricia A. Shiu. ""That's why it's so important for federal contractors to implement their affirmative action programs, keep accurate employment records and commit to ending barriers to fair employment. A proactive strategy is the best way to guarantee that all workers have an equal opportunity to succeed in the workplace. Plus, it's the law."" Baldor Electric, which is owned by Zurich, Switzerland-based ABB Ltd., manufactures industrial motors and generators. The company currently holds federal contracts worth more than $18 million with the General Services Administration and the U.S. departments of Veterans Affairs and Justice. From 1997 to 2010, Baldor received $79 million to produce batteries and generators for federal agencies including GSA, the Justice Department and the Army. In addition to Executive Order 11246, OFCCP enforces Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974. As amended, these three laws require those who do business with the federal government, both contractors and subcontractors, to follow the fair and reasonable standard that they not discriminate in employment on the basis of sex, race, color, religion, national origin, disability or status as a protected veteran.

"June 21, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20120621,OSHA and NIOSH issue hazard alert on ensuring workers in hydraulic fracturing operations have appropriate protections from silica exposure,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health today issued a hazard alert on ensuring that employers in hydraulic fracturing operations take appropriate steps to protect workers from silica exposure. Today's action, which is taken after consultation with stakeholders, including industry, meets the Obama administration's focus on ensuring that this important resource continues to be developed safely and responsibly. The hazard alert follows a cooperative study by NIOSH and industry partners that identified overexposure to silica as a health hazard to workers conducting hydraulic fracturing operations. As noted in the alert, respirable silica is a hazard common to many industries and industrial processes. Because large quantities of silica sand are used during hydraulic fracturing, NIOSH began a cooperative effort in January 2010 to collect data regarding silica exposure at hydraulic fracturing operations. NIOSH worked in cooperation with oil and gas industry partners to sample the air at 11 sites in five states where hydraulic fracturing operations were taking place. NIOSH identified seven primary sources of silica dust exposure during fracturing operations and found that workers downwind of sand mover and blender operations, especially during hot loading, had the highest silica exposures. Workers who breathe silica day after day are at greater risk of developing silicosis, a disease in which lung tissue reacts to trapped silica particles, causing inflammation and scarring, and reducing the lungs' ability to take in oxygen. Silica also can cause lung cancer and has been linked to other diseases, such as tuberculosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and kidney and autoimmune disease. Today's action responds to the NIOSH findings. The alert states that employers must ensure that workers are properly protected from overexposure to silica. The alert describes how a combination of engineering controls, work practices, protective equipment and product substitution, where feasible, along with worker training, can protect workers who are exposed to silica. Engineering controls and work practices provide the best protection for workers. According to the alert, transporting, moving and refilling silica sand into and through sand movers, and along transfer belts and into blender hoppers, can release dust into the air containing up to 99 percent silica that workers breathe. ""Hazardous exposures to silica can and must be prevented. It is important for employers and workers to understand the hazards associated with silica exposure in hydraulic fracturing operations and how to protect workers,"" said Dr. David Michaels, assistant secretary of labor for occupational safety and health. ""OSHA and NIOSH are committed to continuing to work with the industry and workers to find effective solutions to address these hazards."" ""Through partnerships, both businesses and safety professionals are able to collaborate on assessing and managing occupational safety and health risks,"" said NIOSH Director John Howard, M.D. ""The recommendations for protecting workers in the hazard alert are practical, evidence-based and effective solutions to help support the safe growth of American-made energy."" ""We applaud the efforts of the NIOSH NORA Council for Oil and Gas Extraction, OSHA and our partners from industry for helping to raise awareness of this hazard,"" said Kenny Jordan, executive director of the Association of Energy Service Companies. ""We are proud of the development of an industry focus group in cooperation with those agencies which will further explore this issue, share best practices and continue to build upon the many engineering controls currently in place and those under development over the last several years. The safety and health of our workforce is a top priority, and the industry strives to follow and improve best practices for safe operations and works closely with OSHA and NIOSH to help ensure a strong culture of safety. We look forward to sharing improvements not only within our industry, but with others as well."" AFL-CIO Health and Safety Director Margaret Seminario stated, ""The AFL-CIO strongly supports this hazard alert that provides important information to employers and workers involved in hydraulic fracturing operations regarding the serious health threat from silica exposures. It is critical that OSHA and NIOSH disseminate this information, so that immediate action can be taken to protect workers from silicosis and other silica-related diseases."" The hazard alert can be viewed at http://www.osha.gov/dts/hazardalerts/hydraulic_frac_hazard_alert.html . Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. OSHA's role is to ensure these conditions for America's working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education and assistance.

Overall contest winners in three categories were announced in late May, and the public was asked to participate by voting for the top two videos out of four runners-up. Nearly 900 votes were cast. The first runner-up video, ""Hire Me for My Ability,"" was submitted by Developmental Disabilities Service Organization Inc.'s Employment Plus program, which is based in Sacramento, Calif. The video shows the many occupations in which people with disabilities are using their talents to contribute to the workplace and reminds viewers that people with disabilities should be hired for their abilities. The second runner-up video, ""Yes I Can,"" was submitted by students from the Henry Viscardi School in Albertson, N.Y. The video features people with disabilities who are valuable assets to their workplaces. It encourages employers to provide opportunities, hire people with disabilities and focus on abilities. The runner-up winners will receive $250 each, courtesy of the U.S. Business Leadership Network, a founding partner of the campaign. Everyone is encouraged to view and share the videos in support of the Campaign for Disability Employment's mission to challenge negative perceptions about disability employment, and increase knowledge and understanding of the skills and talents of people with disabilities.

The department also has prepared a 16-page booklet, available online, that explains the FLMA and answers common questions. ""The Family and Medical Leave Act provides America's workers one of the country's most important job protections: the right to take leave for a serious health condition or to care for an immediate family member,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""Unfortunately, too many workers don't know about their rights under the FMLA and fail to take advantage of its protections. This webinar will make the law easier to understand, including recent guidance for nontraditional families."" The webinar will give workers and employers a chance to submit questions that will be answered by an FMLA expert from the department. Workers and employers who wish to participate can register at http://s.dol.gov/T2. Members of the news media planning to cover the webinar should notify Joshua Lamont or Jason Surbey in the Labor Department's Office of Public Affairs using the contact information above. As part of the department's continuing effort to make the FMLA more accessible, the department has published ""Need Time? The Employee's Guide to the Family and Medical Leave Act."" The booklet is designed to answer questions such as who can take qualifying leave and what protections the law provides, and is available at http://www.dol.gov/whd/fmla/employeeguide.htm . The FMLA currently provides eligible employees of covered employers 12 workweeks of unpaid, job-protected leave in a 12-month period: for the birth and care of a newborn child of the employee; for the placement with the employee of a son or daughter for adoption or foster care; to care for a spouse, son, daughter or parent with a serious health condition; for a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the essential functions of his or her job; and for qualifying exigencies arising out of the fact that the employee's spouse, son, daughter or parent is a covered military member on ""active duty."" Up to 26 workweeks of leave may be taken during a single 12-month period to care for a covered service member with a serious injury or illness if the eligible employee is the service member's spouse, son, daughter, parent or next of kin (military caregiver leave)."

Solis today announced the award of 64 grants totaling more than $15 million that are aimed at providing approximately 8,600 homeless veterans nationwide with job training to help them succeed in civilian careers. The grants are being awarded under the U.S. Department of Labor's Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program. ""Today, the Department of Labor is taking an important step to help homeless veterans reintegrate into the American labor force,"" said Secretary Solis. ""This is a complicated challenge that requires an all hands on deck' response.

Funds are being awarded on a competitive basis to state and local workforce investment boards, local public agencies and other groups, including faith-based and community organizations. These recipients are familiar with the geographic areas and populations to be served, and have demonstrated that they can provide effective help to homeless veterans. To assist homeless veterans with reintegration into the workforce, in addition to the new grants announced today, during the upcoming program year, the Labor Department will provide more than $19 million in funding to support continuing HVRP grants. Under these grants, homeless veterans may receive occupational, classroom and on-the-job training, as well as job search and placement assistance, including follow-up services.

"June 18, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20120618-0,"US Labor Departments OSHA cites Tribe Mediterranean Foods for safety violations following death of a worker in Taunton, Mass.","BRAINTREE, Mass. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration has cited Tribe Mediterranean Foods, a subsidiary of Nestle SA that manufactures Tribe brand hummus products, for 18 alleged violations of workplace safety standards following the death of a worker at its Taunton production plant. OSHA's South Boston Area Office opened an inspection on Dec. 16, 2011, after a contract employee who was cleaning and sanitizing a machine used in the hummus manufacturing process was caught, pulled into the machine and crushed to death between two rotating augers. OSHA's investigation found that Tribe Mediterranean Foods had not trained the deceased worker and six other workers who cleaned plant machinery on hazardous energy control or ""lockout/tagout"" procedures. These are the procedures employers must put into effect and train workers to follow to shut down machines and lock out their power sources before cleaning or performing maintenance on them. The purpose of lockout/tagout procedures is to ensure that the machines are not operating, and cannot unexpectedly activate and harm workers. OSHA requires that employers train workers so that they understand the purpose of the energy control procedures, and have the knowledge and skills required to safely utilize them. ""The employer knew it needed to train these workers so they could protect themselves against just this type of hazard but failed to do so. The result was a needless and avoidable loss of life,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health Dr. David Michaels. ""In this case, Tribe Mediterranean Foods' knowledge and continuous disregard for an obvious and deadly hazard was so pronounced that we are issuing seven willful citations for lack of training, one for each untrained worker exposed to the hazard."" When there is a particularly egregious lack of compliance and exposure to hazards, OSHA can issue citations on a per-instance basis, in this case, representing one willful violation for each untrained employee exposed to a hazard. OSHA has issued Tribe Mediterranean Foods citations for two additional willful violations, one for failing to adequately train maintenance workers to recognize hazardous energy sources, and one for failing to develop and utilize lockout/tagout procedures. A willful violation is one committed with intentional knowing or voluntary disregard for the law's requirements, or with plain indifference to worker safety and health. Citations for three repeat violations have been issued for failing to conduct periodic inspections of the energy control procedures, inadequate guarding of rotating blades on blending tanks, and an exposed chain and sprocket on a conveyor. A repeat violation can be cited when an employer previously has been cited for the same or a similar violation of a standard, regulation, rule or order at any facility in federal enforcement states within the last five years. OSHA cited Tribe Mediterranean Foods, doing business as FoodTech International Inc., in October 2009, for similar hazards at its New Haven, Conn., plant. Finally, Tribe Mediterranean Foods has been issued citations covering six serious violations for electrical, slipping, fall, pallet jack and additional machine guarding hazards. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known. The citations can be viewed at http://www.osha.gov/ooc/citations/TribeMediterraneanFoodsIncorporated_315145953_0612_12.pdf . Tribe Mediterranean Foods, which faces a total of $702,300 in proposed fines, has 15 business days from receipt of its citations and proposed penalties to comply, meet with OSHA or contest the findings before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. Due to the willful and repeat violations and the nature of the hazards, OSHA has placed Tribe Mediterranean Foods in its Severe Violator Enforcement Program, which mandates targeted follow-up inspections to ensure compliance with the law. The program focuses on recalcitrant employers that endanger workers by committing certain willful, repeat or failure-to-abate violations. For more information on the program, visit http://s.dol.gov/J3. Tribe Mediterranean Foods is a subsidiary of Tivall 1993 LTD, which is owned by Osem Investments Limited, a subsidiary of Nestle SA. The Osem Group of companies produces and distributes certified-kosher food products in Israel, Europe and the United States. In addition to Osem and Migdanot Habayit products, the company imports, markets and distributes throughout the United States products from Wissotzki, Matzot Rishon, Matzot Karmel, Einat, Couscous Maison, Milos, Progress, Tempo, Beit Hashita, Beigel & Beigel, Manamim, Creative and Menora Candles.

""These additional funds will allow these workers, many of whom have significant language and literacy barriers, to continue receiving services that equip them with the necessary skills to re-enter the workforce,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Employment and Training Jane Oates. Awarded to the Massachusetts Department of Workforce Development, the grant is being used for training and support services to be offered in conjunction with other services some of the workers are receiving under the Trade Adjustment Assistance to prepare them for new employment.

"June 18, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20120618-1,US Labor Department announces guidance to state Unemployment Insurance agencies on implementing short-time compensation or work sharing,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor today announced guidance to state agencies responsible for Unemployment Insurance regarding short-time compensation, commonly referred to as ""work sharing."" Today's announcement is the latest in a series of innovative reforms to the UI program made possible by the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 signed by President Obama in February. ""Work sharing is a win-win for workers and employers,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""This program will provide more flexibility to workers and employers so they may more efficiently and effectively weather the ups and downs of the economy."" Work sharing allows employees to keep their jobs and helps employers to avoid laying off their trained workforces during economic downturns by reducing the hours of work for an entire group of affected workers. Workers affected by reduced hours can have their wages compensated with a portion of their weekly unemployment compensation payments. The guidance issued today provides detailed information about a new federal definition of short-time compensation – which includes more worker protections such as maintenance of health insurance and retirement benefits – as well as how states currently operating short-time compensation programs can transition to the new definition. The guidance also provides information to states that already have permanent short-time compensation programs on how to begin receiving 100 percent federal reimbursement of payments made by state programs. The Labor Department will issue additional guidance to address other aspects of short-time compensation found in the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, including a two-year federal initiative to enable states to quickly implement and try out short-time compensation programs; and the provision of approximately $100 million in grants to states for the implementation or improved administration of, or for promotion of and enrollment in, a short-time compensation program. The department also is developing model legislative language, to be provided in the near future, that will assist states in amending their laws so they can adopt short-time compensation programs.

"June 18, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20120618,"Norfolk Southern Railway Co. ordered by US Labor Department's OSHA to pay more than $800,000 after terminating injured workers","WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration has found that Norfolk Southern Railway Co. violated the whistleblower protection provisions of the Federal Railroad Safety Act and consequently has ordered the company to pay three whistleblowers $802,168.70 in damages, including $525,000 in punitive damages and attorneys' fees. Additionally, the company has been ordered to expunge the disciplinary records of the whistleblowers, post workplace notices regarding railroad employees' whistleblower protection rights and provide training to its employees about these rights. Three concurrent investigations were completed by OSHA's offices in Columbia, S.C.; Nashville, Tenn.; and Harrisburg, Pa. The investigations revealed reasonable cause to believe that the employees' reporting of their workplace injuries led to internal investigations and, ultimately, to dismissals from the company. A laborer based in Greenville, S.C., was terminated on Aug. 14, 2009, after reporting an injury as a result of being hit by the company's gang truck. The railroad charged the employee, a laborer, with improper performance of duties. OSHA found that the employee was treated disparately in comparison to four other employees involved in the incident. The laborer was the only employee injured and, thus, the only employee who reported an injury. He also was the only employee terminated. OSHA has ordered the railroad to pay punitive damages of $200,000 as well as compensatory damages of $110,852 and attorney's fees of $14,325. In Louisville, Ky., an engineer at a Norfolk Southern facility was terminated on March 31, 2010, after reporting an injury as a result of tripping and falling in a locomotive restroom. The railroad, after an investigative hearing, charged the employee with falsifying his injury. OSHA found that the investigative hearing was flawed and orchestrated to intentionally support the decision to terminate the employee. OSHA has ordered the railroad to pay the employee $150,000 in punitive damages, $50,000 in compensatory damages and $7,375 in attorney's fees. On July 22, 2010, a railroad conductor based in Harrisburg, Pa., was terminated after reporting a head injury sustained when he blacked out and fell down steps while returning from the locomotive lavatory. The company, after an investigative hearing presided over by management officials, found the employee guilty of falsifying a report of a work-related injury, failing to promptly report the injury, and making false and conflicting statements. The day before the injury, the employee had been lauded for excellent performance, highlighted by no lost work time due to injuries in his 35-year career. OSHA found that the investigative hearing was flawed, and there was no evidence the employee intended to misrepresent his injury. OSHA is ordering the railroad to pay the employee $175,000 in punitive damages, $76,623.27 in back wages plus interest and $17,993.43 in compensatory damages, as well as all fringe benefits. ""Firing workers for reporting an injury is not only illegal, it also endangers all workers. When workers are discouraged from reporting injuries, no investigation into the cause of an injury can occur,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health Dr. David Michaels. ""To prevent more injuries, railroad workers must be able to report an injury without fear of retaliation. The Labor Department will continue to protect all employees, including those in the railroad industry, from retaliation for exercising these basic worker rights. Employers found in violation will be held accountable."" These actions follow several other orders issued by OSHA against Norfolk Southern Railway Co. in the past year. OSHA's investigations have found that the company continues to retaliate against employees for reporting work-related injuries and has effectively created a chilling effect in the railroad industry. Any party to this case can file an appeal with the Labor Department's Office of Administrative Law Judges. Norfolk Southern Railway Co. is a major transporter/hauler of coal and other commodities, serving every major container port in the eastern United States with connections to western carriers. Its headquarters are in Norfolk, Va., and it employs more than 30,000 union workers worldwide. OSHA enforces the whistleblower provisions of the FRSA and 20 other statutes protecting employees who report violations of various securities laws, trucking, airline, nuclear power, pipeline, environmental, rail, maritime, health care, workplace safety and health regulations, and consumer product safety laws. Under the various whistleblower provisions enacted by Congress, employers are prohibited from retaliating against employees who raise various protected concerns or provide protected information to the employer or to the government. Employees who believe that they have been retaliated against for engaging in protected conduct may file a complaint with the secretary of labor for an investigation by OSHA's Whistleblower Protection Program.

"June 18, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20120618,"Former CEO of defunct Southern California electrical contractor agrees to restore more than $570,000 in 401(k) funds to employees","LOS ANGELES – The U.S. Department of Labor has reached an agreement with the former president and CEO of Aliso Viejo-based Journey Electrical Technologies Inc., a defunct electrical contractor, to restore $570,983 to the company’s 401(k) plan. According to a partial consent judgment and order, Mark Dell Donne of San Clemente has agreed to restore $472,235 to the plan. Dell Donne, who served as a fiduciary of the plan, already has restored $98,748 to the plan’s accounts. “We are pleased to be able to secure these retirement funds for the company’s former employees,” said Phyllis C. Borzi, assistant secretary of labor for employee benefits security. “Employees working on government construction or service contracts are often unaware of the benefits they are entitled to under prevailing wage laws, including fringe benefit payments to their employee benefit plans. Plan fiduciaries have a legal responsibility to ensure that this money is properly deposited in employee accounts.” The Labor Department’s lawsuit resulted from an investigation by its Employee Benefits Security Administration, which determined that, between January 2004 and March 2008, some of the employees’ wages for work performed on public works projects were deposited in the company’s general funds instead of the workers’ 401(k) plan accounts as required under the government contracts. Employee elective 401(k) contributions and participant loan payments also were not forwarded for deposit into plan accounts, in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The plan had 105 participants and a balance of more than $1.9 million as of Dec. 31, 2010, the latest information available. The partial consent judgment and order, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California in Fresno, permanently bars Dell Donne from violating ERISA and removes him as a plan trustee upon the appointment of an independent fiduciary who will collect and pay out the assets in the plan’s accounts. The action resulted from an investigation by EBSA’s Los Angeles Regional Office and was litigated by the department’s regional Office of the Solicitor. Employers and workers can contact EBSA at 626-229-1000 or toll-free at 866-444-3272 for assistance with problems related to private sector pension and health plans.

Solis on deferred action process for young people who are low enforcement priorities,"WASHINGTON – Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis today issued the following statement on the deferred action process for young people who are low enforcement priorities: ""The major change to our nation's immigration policy announced today by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security will not only benefit young immigrants, who know no other country than this as their own, but our economy and our nation as a whole. ""The policy change will have a very real and meaningful impact on our workforce and on our work at the U.S. Department of Labor. We know that a skilled, educated and entrepreneurial workforce is critical to our economic success in the 21st century. These young immigrants give our workforce a competitive advantage at home and in the international economy. Not only will they contribute to U.S. businesses as workers, but they will also contribute as consumers – helping to boost our economic growth and prosperity. ""The administration has taken a big step in the right direction today. Now it's time for Congress to get to work and pass the DREAM Act and comprehensive immigration reform.

Solis today announced nearly $147 million in grants to develop and expand innovative strategies to help Americans return to work by delivering services more efficiently, facilitating cooperation across programs and funding streams, and focusing on partnerships with specific employers or industry sectors to develop programs that reflect current and future skill needs. ""The Workforce Innovation Fund was created to cultivate and test innovative approaches to workforce training and encourage the replication of evidence-based practices in the workforce development field,"" said Secretary Solis. ""Developing new and creative strategies and expanding existing programs we know work will help make the workforce system more effective to unemployed Americans and employers looking for qualified employees."" One of the overarching goals of the Workforce Innovation Fund is to better assess the effectiveness of each workforce strategy, so all grants include an evaluation component. By evaluating projects, the fund will significantly increase the body of knowledge about the most effective strategies in workforce development. Twenty-six grants, ranging from $1 million to $12 million each, have been awarded to a combination of state workforce agencies and local workforce investment boards, as well as one Workforce Investment Act Section 166 grantee serving Indian and Native American communities. The original solicitation for grant applications announced that $98 million would be awarded. Because of a tremendous response, the quality of applications received and the immediate need for additional resources, the department has elected to provide additional grants using $49 million from fiscal years 2011 and 2012 funds. The Labor Department also is highlighting the availability of up to $20 million through the second round of Workforce Innovation Fund funding – expected to be announced in spring 2013 – to pilot the ""Pay for Success"" model. This model represents a new way of financing workforce investment projects through which the government only pays for services that achieve measurable results, shifting the risk of investment from the government to the private sector.

Hutcheson and Hutcheson Walker Advisors LLC,"WASHINGTON — On June 13, the U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho granted the U.S. Department of Labor's motion for preliminary injunction against Matthew D. Hutcheson and Hutcheson Walker Advisors LLC. The court found that the department had ""demonstrated the type of immediate and irreparable injury necessitating entry of a preliminary injunction."" On May 15, the department filed a complaint in the same court against Hutcheson and others alleging that Hutcheson had violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The complaint alleged that, toward the end of 2010, Hutcheson used more than $3.2 million in retirement plan savings of workers from multiple employers for his own personal benefit and in an attempt to purchase an interest in the Tamarack Resort, a failed ski and golf resort in Idaho. Hutcheson's alleged misconduct has left the affected retirement plans without sufficient funds to pay participants all the benefits owed to them. Hutcheson also faces a separate criminal indictment, filed by the U.S. Department of Justice in the same court on April 10, in connection with the same transaction and others. Concurrent with its civil complaint, the department filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, seeking removal of defendants Hutcheson and Hutcheson Walker Advisors as fiduciaries of the Retirement Security Plan and Trust, formerly known as the Pension Liquidity Plan and Trust. The secretary of labor also requested the appointment of Jeanne B. Bryant of Receivership Management Inc. as independent fiduciary to the Retirement Security Plan and Trust and the plans. On May 16 the court granted the secretary's motion for a temporary restraining order and took the motion for preliminary injunction under advisement. The order is the court's granting of the injunctive relief sought by the department. In addition to Hutcheson and Hutcheson Walker Advisors LLC, defendants in the secretary's action include Green Valley Holdings LLC and the Retirement Security Plan and Trust.

"June 13, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20120613,Assistant secretary of labor kicks off seminar on achieving a culture of prevention in the mining industry,"Enhanced enforcement strategies are working, says MSHAs Joseph Main ARLINGTON, Va. – Despite a number of challenges confronting the mining industry over the past two and a half years, including the worst coal mine disaster in four decades, the actions being taken by the U.S. Labor Department's Mine Safety and Health Administration and many in the industry are making a positive difference and moving mine safety and health in the right direction. That was the central theme of Assistant Secretary of Labor for Mine Safety and Health Joseph A. Main's remarks delivered today at ""Measuring Progress Toward a Safety Culture of Prevention in Mining,"" a one-day seminar sponsored by Pennsylvania State University's Miner Training Program near Pittsburgh, Pa. ""Following the April 2010 explosion of the Upper Big Branch Mine, one of my most significant challenges was keeping MSHA focused on our overall mission and agenda to advance mine safety,"" said Main. ""That tragedy clearly identified that more needed to be done to provide miners with a voice in the workplace, and that MSHA needed to more aggressively use its tools under the Mine Act to enforce the law. We began taking actions immediately after the disaster, and we are still continuing to implement a number of initiatives to make mines safer."" Three months ago, the agency released the results of its internal review into actions leading up to and immediately following the UBB explosion, including recommendations for improving MSHA's effectiveness. ""We are changing how we do business at MSHA,"" said Main. To that end, the agency has undertaken a comprehensive review of its policy directive system, as well as a complete overhaul of its coal mine inspectors' handbook to make it clear and concise. MSHA also is increasing staff training and addressing shortcomings repeatedly identified in several past agency internal reviews. The enhanced enforcement strategies MSHA is implementing are working, according to Main. During the more than two-year-old impact inspection program, which targets mines with chronic compliance issues, MSHA has conducted 443 inspections, resulting in 7,948 citations, 785 orders and 29 safeguards. ""Overall compliance is improving at these mines,"" he said. Violations per inspection hour are down 13 percent after mines received an initial impact inspection. The significant and substantial, or S&S, violation rate is down 21 percent and 104(d) withdrawal orders are down 43 percent. The total lost-time injury rate at these mines is down 13 percent. Main added, ""Unfortunately, there are some mine operators that still haven't gotten the message."" Main noted also that the agency's pattern of violations initiative is netting positive results. In a recent review of enforcement data on the 14 mines that received initial potential POV notices in 2010, the total violation rate at these mines is down 25 percent, the total S&S violation rate is down 44 percent and the rate of 104(d) withdrawal orders is down 66 percent. The lost-time injury rate at these mines has dropped 43 percent. Compliance data also show that improvements are occurring in the mining industry as a whole. In 2011, MSHA inspected about 14,170 mines and issued 157,678 citations and orders. This is down from 2010, when MSHA issued 171,018 citations and orders. In 2011, MSHA issued 49,582 S&S and 2,920 unwarrantable failure citations and orders, down from 56,502 S&S and 3,370 unwarrantable issued in 2010, a decrease of about 9 percent. Main outlined other important initiatives currently being implemented: ""Rules to Live By"": This multiphase initiative focused in phase one on the most common mining deaths and standards cited most often in mining death investigations. Phase two focused on preventing catastrophic accidents, and phase three highlights 14 safety standards chosen because violations related to each have been cited as contributing to at least five mining accidents and at least five deaths during a 10-year period. Regulatory Actions: New rules have been issued requiring more rock dusting in underground mines to prevent explosions and thorough examinations of underground coal mines to improve compliance and prevent injuries, illnesses and deaths. MSHA's final rule on examinations in underground mines, effective Aug. 6, mandates operators to identify and correct violations of standards related to ventilation, methane, roof control, combustible materials, rock dust and guarding. (Forty-nine percent of all violations in 2011 were cited at underground coal mines, even though these mines represent just 5 percent of all mines inspected.) Mine Emergency Response: Significant progress has been made through the development of new technologies to aid mine rescue, improving command and control preparedness and engaging the mining community in a dialogue to identify and implement additional improvements. Guarding Compliance: Two years ago, the most commonly cited violations involved guarding of equipment and conveyer belts in metal and nonmetal mining. Following the publication of ""Guarding Conveyer Belts at Metal and Nonmetal Mines,"" compliance has improved and guarding citations and orders are down 40 percent from 2010 levels. Stakeholder Outreach: Meetings have been held with industry stakeholders on the front end of new initiatives, and MSHA has provided them with the same education and training that inspectors receive. Consistency in mine inspections: MSHA improved oversight of the inspection program and consistency in the enforcement of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 with a new training program for all field office supervisors. To date, all supervisors have received the training and will receive retraining every two years. In 2011, 37 miners died in work-related accidents at the nation's mines the second lowest figure since statistics have been recorded. ""As low as those numbers are, we all know that one death is one too many and that mining deaths are preventable,"" said Main. ""The distance to zero is much shorter than in 1977, when the Mine Act went into effect. I know we all share the goal of zero fatalities."" Editor's note: All figures based on data through March 2012."

"June 12, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20120612,US Labor Department suit results in court order requiring Chicago-area investment service provider to restore $1.2 million to worker retirement plans,"CHICAGO – Following an investigation by the U.S. Department of Labor and resulting lawsuit, a federal court has issued a default judgment against the co-founder and director of the now defunct Elmhurst-based investment management company Results One Financial LLC. Steven Salutric has been ordered to restore $1,211,902.25 to four pension plan client accounts from which he allegedly withdrew funds from 2005 through 2009 in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. “It is particularly egregious when those entrusted with protecting workers’ retirement assets jeopardize them by committing illegal acts for personal gain,” said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. “The Labor Department is committed to taking all necessary actions to ensure that workers’ hard-earned income and benefits are protected. America’s workers deserve and are entitled to keep what they have rightfully earned for themselves and their families.” The department’s suit, filed in federal district court in Chicago, alleged that Salutric misdirected the assets of client plans to entities in which he had an interest, including a film distribution company, a restaurant and a real estate partnership, and to a church where he served as treasurer. Results One Financial LLC was a registered investment advisory company that provided services to a wide range of clients, including ERISA-covered employee benefit plans. “Worker retirement savings accounts were given special protections by Congress due to the significant role they play in providing a secure retirement,” said Phyllis C. Borzi, assistant secretary of labor for employee benefits security. “The Labor Department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration will continue to help workers understand their rights and fight to protect their assets.” The court order requires Salutric to restore all losses, including lost opportunity costs, to the four pension plan clients and to correct the prohibited transactions involved. The judgment also bars Salutric from serving as a fiduciary or service provider to any employee benefit plan governed by ERISA in the future. EBSA’s Chicago Regional Office investigated the case in coordination with the Chicago Regional Office of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Employers and workers can contact EBSA’s Chicago office at 312-353-0900 or the agency’s toll-free number at 866-444-3272 for help with problems related to private sector health and pension plans.

Solis today issued the following statement celebrating Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Pride Month: ""This month, Americans continue our march to a more perfect union by proudly celebrating our many victories in the fight for LGBT equality. ""We are proud to live in a country where gays and lesbians can now serve openly in the armed forces, just as we are proud that our military is led by a commander-in-chief who understands that sexual orientation has nothing to do with one's fitness to serve. ""We are proud of our president's history-making support for the right to marry regardless of sexual orientation, just as we are proud that he refuses to use taxpayer dollars to defend the Defense of Marriage Act. ""We are proud of our country's leadership at home and abroad in protecting Americans from violence, hate crimes, bullying and harassment. ""We are proud that we've now enshrined into our laws the rights of our LGBT friends to receive the same health care benefits as their straight neighbors, and we are proud that our government has said to America's federally funded hospitals that they may no longer separate loving same-sex couples when they are sick and need each other the most. ""At the Department of Labor, we are proud to have clarified that the Family and Medical Leave Act applies to all kinds of families. Two million children are being raised by parents in same-sex relationships, and our action ensures that, regardless of a parent's legal relationship to his or her child, he or she can take leave to care for the child in the event of a medical emergency. In other words: If you act like a parent, do the work of a parent and raise a child like a parent, then you are a parent, as far as the Department of Labor is concerned. ""Like all of the great civil rights victories in our nation's history, this hard-won progress was forged by the determined advocacy of so many pioneers who refused to settle for second-class citizenship based on who they love. While we know many battles lie ahead in the fight to secure full equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans, this June, let's pause to reflect on the many barriers we've overcome as we strive to realize the promise of equal justice under law for every LGBT American."""

""Our labor market continues to recover. We continue to add jobs to an economy that was once bleeding 800,000 a month under the previous administration.

""This is a critical moment, and more must be done to put Americans back to work. This administration has put forward a number of efforts to support the unemployed and spur more economic growth.

These numbers provide more precise estimates and focus our attention on the magnitude of this global crime and on the plight of those who continue to be coerced or deceived into forced labor or sexual exploitation, and are a welcome addition to the research in this important area. ""The Department of Labor commends the ILO for the transparency of its research process and for its commitment to improving survey methodologies to estimate hidden and vulnerable populations. The department funded the ILO's efforts to develop survey guidelines to estimate forced labor of adults and children, and worked with four governments to conduct national forced labor surveys. When the tools of research are used to inform policies and programs, the effectiveness of our efforts to eradicate modern slavery will be long-lasting. The department commends those governments that contributed to the global estimate by opening their doors to data collection in order to better understand the complexities regarding modern slavery, and we encourage other governments to do so as well. ""The United States will continue to bring resources to bear on the scourge of modern slavery through the President's Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons, in partnership with civil society and the private sector. Today we reaffirm our commitment to eradicating this affront to human dignity and justice."""
"May 31, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20120531,Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis receives award from Association of Farmworker Opportunity Programs,"WASHINGTON – Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis today was honored by the Association of Farmworker Opportunity Programs, which presented her with the Champion for the Futures of Farmworker Children Award for her commitment to improving the lives of farmworkers around the country through education and training. The Association of Farmworker Opportunity Programs promotes better living and working conditions for farmworkers by providing job training, supportive services and housing assistance to more than 20,000 migrant and seasonal farmworkers each year. The association's efforts include the ""Children in the Fields Campaign,"" an initiative that aims to better protect America's youth working in agricultural fields. Recently, the U.S. Department of Labor announced more than $80 million in grants through the National Farmworker Jobs Program that many organizations – including AFOP – are using to combat chronic unemployment that plagues those who harvest in our fields. The AFOP uses funding from the National Farmworker Jobs Program to help farmworkers upgrade their agricultural job skills or acquire new skills that enable them to earn higher wages and find more stable employment. ""The Association of Farmworker Opportunity Programs and the Department of Labor share an interest in helping migrant and seasonal farmworkers earn a living with dignity and respect,"" said Secretary Solis. ""I am honored to receive this award and commend the AFOP on its good work."" AFOP Executive Director David A. Strauss, joined by other AFOP staff, presented Secretary Solis with the award at Labor Department headquarters in Washington.

"May 31, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20120531,MSHA announces results of April impact inspections,"ARLINGTON, Va. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration today announced that federal inspectors issued 335 citations, orders and safeguards during special impact inspections conducted at eight coal mines and four metal/nonmetal mines last month. The coal mines were issued 254 citations, 19 orders and one safeguard, while the metal/nonmetal operations were issued 52 citations and nine orders. These inspections, which began in force in April 2010 following the explosion at the Upper Big Branch Mine, involve mines that merit increased agency attention and enforcement due to their poor compliance history or particular compliance concerns, including high numbers of violations or closure orders; frequent hazard complaints or hotline calls; plan compliance issues; inadequate workplace examinations; a high number of accidents, injuries or illnesses; fatalities; and adverse conditions such as increased methane liberation, faulty roof conditions and inadequate ventilation. As an example from last month's impact inspections, on April 17, MSHA personnel visited Rebco Coal Inc.'s Valley Mine No. 1 in Claiborne County, Tenn., during the production shift. They secured the communications systems to prevent advance notification of the inspection and traveled the primary escapeway to inspect all four conveyor belts to the mechanized mining unit. MSHA issued 81 enforcement actions as a result of the inspection, including 74 citations, four failure-to-abate orders for previously issued citations, one unwarrantable failure citation and two unwarrantable failure orders. The inspection party cited a broad spectrum of violations covering ventilation, accumulations of combustible materials, electrical equipment, trailing cables and fire protection. During previous inspections at the mine, equipment had been tagged out of service; however, when the operator resumed production a week prior to the impact inspection, the equipment had not been repaired. MSHA found numerous defects on the mechanized mining unit's roof bolter, including accumulations of combustible materials. An unwarrantable failure order was issued for the operator's failure to conduct an adequate electrical examination on the continuous miner to ensure that the equipment is maintained in a safe operating condition. Citations were issued for 18 defects of the continuous miner that affect the permissibility of the machine, and additional citations were issued for failing to maintain the lighting system on the remote-controlled machine, accumulations on the continuous miner, failing to install a methane-sensing device as close to the working face as practical and failing to adequately insulate the trailing cable for the miner. The operator's failure to adequately examine the equipment and maintain it in a safe and permissible condition posed a high degree of danger to the miners. ""This unexpected inspection found several safety violations that placed miners at serious risk, a failure by the mine operator to conduct basic find and fix examinations, and a disregard for violations previously cited by MSHA,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""As evidenced by the recent inspection blitz, MSHA will not hesitate to take action to protect workers at risk."" As another example from last month's inspections, on April 24, MSHA personnel visited Argus Energy WV LLC's Deep Mine No. 8 in Wayne County, W.Va. – the second impact inspection at this mine. The mine's communication system was captured to prevent advance notice of the inspection. The inspection party issued 87 104(a) citations, one unwarrantable failure 104(d) citation and eight unwarrantable failure 104(d) orders for violations of 51 sections of MSHA regulations. Deep Mine No. 8 was selected for an April inspection due to its frequent number of accidents and repeated noncompliance with mandatory safety and health standards. Since April 2011, there have been 23 separate accidents, 12 having occurred since this January. The operator has been issued a total of 386 citations and 22 orders, 11 of which were unwarrantable failure orders. During last month's impact inspection, the mine operator was cited for combustible material that was permitted to accumulate in the belt entry, on and under belt equipment, and along moving belts. MSHA inspectors found coal in large piles for distances up to 100 feet and up to 2 feet in depth in numerous locations. Conveyor belts were rubbing the belt structure, and the tail roller had been turning in accumulations 2 feet deep and 7 feet wide – conditions that pose a significant fire and explosion hazard. The inspection team also issued two 104(d)(1) orders for failure to conduct adequate examinations on the belt conveyors. The operator also was cited for failure to adequately support the mine's roof and ribs, and allowing miners to work and travel under an unsupported roof, exposing them to potential roof falls and serious injury. Finally, inspectors found multiple electrical violations, including a failure to maintain permissible face equipment and provide an accurate electrical system map, have a qualified examiner, and properly install and insulate wires and cables for communications and power. Since April 2010, MSHA has conducted 443 impact inspections at coal and metal/nonmetal mines. These inspections have resulted in 7,948 citations, 785 orders and 29 safeguards for a total of 8,762 issuances.

"May 29, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20120529,Statement by Secretary Solis on Dolores Huerta receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom,"WASHINGTON – Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis today issued the following statement regarding the selection of Dolores Huerta for the Presidential Medal of Freedom: "" As a young girl growing up in La Puente, Calif., I was mesmerized by images of Dolores Huerta. I remember seeing in the newspaper the iconic photo of her holding up the HUELGA sign and seeing her on television, standing behind Robert F. Kennedy just seconds before he was assassinated. ""I thought she was beautiful, with a mane of raven-colored hair, eyes that danced, and a soft, sweet voice that carried an extraordinary message whenever she spoke to crowds. But for me, her true beauty came from the inside. She lived an authentic life, in service to others. Her passion was and is justice. She has for more than half a century dedicated her life to helping the men and women who harvest America's fields. She has advocated for non-violent protest and has taught people that they have both the personal power and the responsibility to work together to improve their lives. Back then, I never dreamed that I would ever meet her, let alone have the honor of calling her my friend. ""I don't know if Dolores inspired me to become a public servant, but I do know that she inspired – and insisted – that I become the best public servant I could be. We got to know each other in the early 1990s, when I was in the California State Legislature. Wherever there was injustice... Dolores was there. I remember one of our first meetings as if it were yesterday: I was serving in the State Senate and working with a group of female farmworkers who were organizing a union. There were reports of violence during the campaign, and Dolores came to my office in Sacramento to see me. ""She showed me a video of a man brutally throwing an entire crate of strawberries on the head of a woman working in the fields. When the video concluded, she looked up at me and simply said, We need to do something. Let's get to work.' And we did, crafting legislation and collaborating closely with the Agricultural Labor Relations Board in California. Our efforts made a difference. ""Dolores was no stranger to acts of violence or threats of intimidation against her. At the age of 58, she was beaten and nearly killed by a San Francisco police officer during a non-violent and lawful protest. She suffered broken bones but never a broken spirit. ""Today, President Obama will honor her with the Presidential Medal of Freedom for a lifetime dedicated to workers' rights and social justice. She joins the ranks of other luminaries throughout history, including C sar Ch vez, Martin Luther King Jr. and Mother Teresa, who have received this much-deserved honor. ""At 82 years young, Dolores still continues to empower people through the Dolores Huerta Foundation, which organizes low-income immigrant communities in the Central San Joaquin Valley for better access to education, health care, fair lending and a cleaner environment. Her passion for justice has expanded to include women's equality, reproductive rights and LGBT issues. Her dancing eyes and sweet voice continue to inspire people across the country and around the world, just like they did for a young girl from La Puente who grew up to be the first Latina in a president's Cabinet. Today, she is my mentor, adviser and wonderful friend. And she is still beautiful."" Read this news release en Espa ol ."
"May 29, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20120529,Obama administration launches $26 million multi-agency competition to strengthen advanced manufacturing clusters across the nation,"14 federal agencies collaborate to enhance global competitiveness of US manufacturers and create jobs WASHINGTON – The Obama administration today announced a $26 million multi-agency Advanced Manufacturing Jobs and Innovation Accelerator Challenge to foster innovation-fueled job creation through public-private partnerships. These coordinated investments will help catalyze and leverage private capital, build an entrepreneurial ecosystem and promote cluster-based development in regions across the United States. This is the third round of the Jobs Accelerator competition, which is being funded by the U.S. Department of Commerce's Economic Development Administration as well as the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Department of Labor's Employment and Training Administration, the Small Business Administration and the National Science Foundation. ""The Jobs Accelerator Challenge is one way the federal government is helping to support the manufacturing industry, a vital source of middle-class jobs,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""The innovative products developed as a result of this federal grant program will help our economy maintain its global competitive advantage, while also creating jobs at home."" ""This $26 million Jobs Accelerator Challenge is yet another example of the Obama administration's commitment to supporting American manufacturers in building things here and selling them everywhere,"" said Commerce Secretary John Bryson. ""We are so pleased to join with our federal agency partners to further strengthen the American manufacturing sector, which creates high-quality, good-paying jobs. Commerce's Economic Development Administration has a strong record of investing in regional innovation clusters that foster the job creation and business development crucial to an economy that is built to last. This challenge further bolsters our efforts and builds on the momentum we have seen in the manufacturing sector in recent months, including the 489,000 U.S. manufacturing jobs that have been added since January 2010."" Advanced manufacturing is critical to the health of the national economy and provides essential goods and equipment directly to consumers as well as to a wide range of industries, including the energy production, agriculture, medical and computing industries, and the security and intelligence sectors. Manufacturing accounts for 70 percent of private sector research and development, and 60 percent of U.S. exports – including a record $1.2 trillion in goods exported in 2011. Over the past 25 months, manufacturers have created nearly half a million jobs – the best streak since 1995. The Jobs Accelerator Challenge is designed to assist the development and implementation of regionally driven economic development strategies that will support advanced manufacturing and cluster development. The goals are to create jobs, grow the economy and enhance the competitiveness of U.S. manufacturers in the global marketplace. ""'Made in America' is making a comeback,"" said SBA Administrator Karen Mills. ""The Jobs Accelerator Challenge is an opportunity to build on the momentum we're seeing in U.S. manufacturing and to support small businesses and local economies through regional innovation clusters. By working with other federal agencies, we can link, leverage and align our resources to give small businesses the tools they need to work together, grow and create jobs in the manufacturing sector."" Approximately 12 projects are expected to be chosen through a competitive interagency grant process. Applicants are encouraged to submit proposals that will help grow a region's industry clusters by strengthening connections to regional economic development opportunities and advanced manufacturing assets, enhance a region's capacity to create high-quality sustainable jobs, develop a skilled and diverse advanced manufacturing workforce, increase exports, encourage the development of small businesses and accelerate technological innovation. ""Through this partnership, the National Science Foundation will connect innovations from NSF-supported advanced manufacturing research with stakeholders who can accelerate technology commercialization and economic growth,"" said Thomas Peterson, NSF assistant director for engineering. ""NSF is making available up to $1 million for existing NSF Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer Phase II grantees that are part of winning projects."" The deadline for Advanced Manufacturing Jobs and Innovation Accelerator Challenge applications is July 9, and guidelines for submissions are accessible at http://www.manufacturing.gov . In addition to the six funding partners, the initiative is supported by eight other federal agencies: the U.S. Departments of Agriculture, Education, Housing and Urban Development; the U.S. Department of Commerce's International Trade Administration; the Environmental Protection Agency; the Denali Commission; the Minority Business Development Administration; and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. ""As President Obama made clear, an American economy built to last will depend on American manufacturing, American energy and skills for American workers,"" said Energy Secretary Steven Chu. ""This is why the Energy Department invests in innovative, public-private initiatives like the Advanced Manufacturing Jobs and Innovation Accelerator Challenge that support American leadership and competitiveness in manufacturing."" As part of President Obama's commitment to putting more people back to work and creating an economy built to last, the administration has invested more than $200 million promoting regional innovation clusters. The administration also created an interagency task force, known as the Taskforce for the Advancement of Regional Innovation Clusters, to develop and administer interagency grant competitions. More than a dozen federal agencies have participated in TARIC-led grant competitions by providing grant funding or other forms of support to the winners of the Jobs and Innovation Accelerator Challenges."
"May 29, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/odep/odep20120529,Campaign for Disability Employment announces 'What can YOU do?' video contest winners,"Public asked to vote for runner-up videos WASHINGTON — The Campaign for Disability Employment, a collaborative of leading disability and business organizations funded by the U.S. Department of Labor's Office of Disability Employment Policy, has selected the winning videos in the 2012 ""What can YOU do?"" video contest. This nationwide contest challenged filmmakers to produce disability employment awareness videos that reflect the diversity of skills people with disabilities offer, challenge common misconceptions about disability employment and reinforce the CDE's core message that, at work, it's what people CAN do that matters. The 2012 ""What can YOU do?"" video contest winners were selected in three categories: employer, youth and general public. Judging was based on originality, content, reflection of campaign themes and categories, production value, impact and accessibility. Winning videos now will be used in support of the campaign's national effort to increase the employment of people with disabilities. In the employer category, Adam Dylewski of Washington, D.C., and the Chemists with Disabilities Committee of the American Chemical Society were recognized for their video, ""Chemists with Disabilities: We All Can."" The video, which features chemists with disabilities sharing the value and talent they bring to their industry, demonstrates ACS' leadership on the issue of disability employment and the benefits of fostering a work culture welcoming of the talents of all individuals, including workers with disabilities. The youth category winner is Jake Johnson of Clarence, N.Y., for his video ""What WILL You Do?"" The video illustrates the importance of developing and reaching goals and believing in oneself. Finally, in the general public category, the honor goes to Dylan Johanson of Rosendale, N.Y., for his video ""Challenge Your Assumptions."" The video shares the true story of Margaret, a school cafeteria employee who helped a child who was choking, potentially saving her life. Margaret is a hard-working and valued employee who has a disability. Everyone is encouraged to view and share the winning videos in support of the CDE's mission to challenge negative perceptions about disability employment and increase knowledge and understanding of the skills and talents of people with disabilities. The CDE now seeks public participation in the ""What can YOU do?"" video contest by asking everyone to vote for their two favorite runner-up videos. Two videos will receive $250.00, courtesy of the US Business Leadership Network, a CDE founding partner. Cast your vote today at http://whatcanyoudocampaign.org/videoVOTE.html!

"May 24, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20120524,US Labor Department's OSHA identifies 30 safety and health violations at Veterans Affairs health care facilities in Northern California,"SAN FRANCISCO – The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration has issued 30 notices of unsafe and unhealthful working conditions for violations found during inspections of four U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs medical facilities. OSHA began the inspections during November 2011 at the VA hospital in Mather and at outpatient clinics in Martinez, Fairfield and Oakland. All are part of the VA's Northern California Health Care System. ""The safety hazards identified at these four clinics demonstrate a need for a renewed commitment by the Department of Veterans Affairs to provide a safe workplace for the VA employees who care for our nation's wounded and aging soldiers,"" said David Shiraishi, director of OSHA's Oakland Area Office. OSHA issued notices for 25 serious violations involving blocked emergency exit doors and routes, multiple electrical hazards, a lack of proper machine guarding and exposure to contaminated needles. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known. A notice also has been issued for a repeat violation involving the improper storage of biological hazardous waste. A repeat violation exists when an employer previously has been cited for the same or a similar violation of a standard, regulation, rule or order at any other facility in federal enforcement states within the last five years. A notice for a similar violation at the Mather hospital was issued in 2007. OSHA also has issued notices for four other-than-serious violations involving an incomplete written hazard communication program and failing to identify exit doors. An other-than-serious violation is one that has a direct relationship to job safety and health, but probably would not cause death or serious physical harm. Under Executive Order 12196, federal agencies must comply with the same safety and health standards as private sector employers covered under the Occupational Safety and Health Act.The federal agency equivalent to a private sector citation is the Notice of Unsafe or Unhealthful Working Conditions. The OSHA notice is used to inform establishment officials of violations of OSHA standards, alternate standards and 29 Code of Federal Regulations citable program elements. OSHA cannot propose monetary penalties against another federal agency for failure to comply with OSHA standards. The VA's Northern California Health Care System has 15 business days from receipt of the notices to comply, request an informal conference with OSHA's area director or appeal the notices by submitting a summary of its position on the unresolved issues to OSHA's regional administrator. To ask questions, obtain compliance assistance, file a complaint, or report workplace hospitalizations, fatalities or situations posing imminent danger to workers, call OSHA's toll-free hotline at 800-321-OSHA (6742) or the agency's Oakland office at 510-637-3800. Under Section 19 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 and Executive Order 12196, the head of each agency is responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for his or her employees. OSHA's role is to ensure these conditions for all federal employees by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education and assistance.For more information, visit http://www.osha.gov ."

"May 24, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20120524,US Labor Department announces availability of $35 million in grants to implement or improve Self-Employment Assistance programs,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor today announced the availability of $35 million in funds to develop, enhance and promote Self-Employment Assistance programs in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. In addition, guidance released today clarifies that states may enroll participants who are currently receiving or eligible for federally funded Emergency Unemployment Compensation and Extended Benefits. This announcement is the latest in a series of innovative reforms to the Unemployment Insurance program made possible through the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, which was signed by President Obama in February. ""Self-Employment Assistance has proven to be a valuable tool in helping many unemployed Americans realize the dream of business ownership,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""These grants will help states improve and expand the program while strengthening the economy and creating new jobs as more startups launch and grow."" Participants in these voluntary programs are provided with financial assistance equal to their Unemployment Insurance benefits while they receive important entrepreneurial training and resources to help launch their own businesses. In order to allow participants to devote full-time attention to creating new businesses that have the potential to create additional jobs, state work search requirements are waived. Grant money can be used by states to implement a new Self-Employment Assistance program or improve the administration of current programs, as well as to promote programs and enroll eligible participants. In order to receive federal funding, states' UI laws must meet the Labor Department's requirements. Five states (Delaware, Maine, New Jersey, New York and Oregon) have active Self-Employment Assistance programs and are eligible now to apply for these grant funds. The other states have until June 30, 2013, to submit complete applications to the department. The Labor Department will work with interested states to assist them in developing legislation as needed, and to implement Self-Employment Assistance programs. The department also will work with states on outreach strategies to identify potential entrepreneurs who are good candidates to start their own businesses. Additionally, the department is partnering with the Small Business Administration to provide technical assistance to states and to ensure that SBA resources are leveraged as states design Self-Employment Assistance programs.

"May 24, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20120524,"US Labor Department suit frees more than $2 million in retirement assets for workers of defunct Weehawken, NJ, employer","WEEHAWKEN, N.J. ‒ The U.S. Department of Labor has obtained a court order appointing an independent fiduciary to manage the abandoned 401(k) plan of Worldwide Trade Resources Inc., formerly located in Weehawken. As of Jan. 31, 2011, the latest information available, the plan had 52 participants and assets totaling approximately $2.2 million. Under the order, entered in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, M. Larry Lefoldt of Lefoldt & Co. P.A. has been appointed to serve as an independent fiduciary of the 401(k) plan. As such, he has the authority to manage the plan, distribute its assets to eligible participants and beneficiaries, and terminate it. The order resolves a lawsuit filed by the Labor Department in October 2011 that was based on an investigation conducted by the New York Regional Office of the department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration. “Retirement savings are extremely important to workers and their families, especially to those who have left the workforce and are relying on those savings as their primary source of support,” said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. “We are pleased that these plan participants soon will once again have access to the hard-earned savings they entrusted to the plan established by their former employer.” “Workers and beneficiaries are still entitled to collect their retirement savings even if an employer goes out of business,” said Phyllis C. Borzi, assistant secretary of labor for employee benefits security. “My agency is committed to protecting the rights of plan participants and ensuring they have access to the retirement benefits they have earned.” The department’s suit alleged that Worldwide Trade Resources Inc. ceased operations in or around October 2010 and did not provide for the distribution of individual account balances. Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, plans must be managed by named fiduciaries. In the absence of a plan fiduciary, participants and beneficiaries cannot obtain plan information, make investments or collect retirement benefits. Employers and workers can reach EBSA’s New York office at 212-607-8600 or toll-free at 866-444-3272 for help with problems related to private sector retirement and health plans.

These grants represent the fifth round of funding under the department's Reintegration of Ex-Offenders-Adult program, through which more than $98 million has been awarded to date. ""A strong support network is the key for formerly incarcerated individuals to successfully transition back to their communities,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""The federal grants announced today will help to establish this network, while also providing job training to ensure long-term stability and success."" Grantees will use the funds to provide occupational training that leads to credentials in high-demand industries; mentoring; and assistance in connecting formerly incarcerated adults with supportive services such as housing, substance abuse programs and mental health treatment. In 2010, nearly 709,000 people were released from state and federal prisons, an increase of almost 20 percent from 2002. Research indicates that, without assistance to make a successful transition, the majority of former offenders return to criminal activity. This program aims to break that cycle.

Nearly 22 years after the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act and 39 years after the passage of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, people with disabilities continue to be employed at much lower levels than those without disabilities. The goal of the app challenge is to promote recruitment resources for employers, develop job training and skill-building tools for job seekers, facilitate employment-related transportation options and expand information communication technology accessibility. ""I am thrilled to announce the Labor Department's first disability employment app challenge. Using today's technology, we hope to inspire creative and innovative solutions to the pressing employment-related problems faced by people with disabilities,"" said Kathy Martinez, assistant secretary of labor for disability employment policy. Submissions should provide access to important data and resources; attract users with different skill sets and language preferences; be accessible (that is, compatible and interoperable with assistive technology commonly used by individuals with disabilities, such as screen reading and speech recognition software); and consider partnerships that will ensure sustainability of the app. In addition, they should be targeted toward a variety of audiences such as students, teachers, employers, career counselors and workforce professionals, as well as individuals with disabilities working or seeking work at all levels in a variety of salaried and hourly jobs. Awards with cash prizes — totaling $10,000 — will be given to the top three submissions, including the grand prize Innovation Award, the second prize People's Choice Award, and the third prize Above and Beyond Accessibility Award. The winners will be featured prominently on ODEP's website, http://www.dol.gov/odep/ , as well as at http://disability.gov and through other public outreach vehicles. Contestants must register for the contest on the Challenge.gov website by creating an account at http://challenge.gov/users/login . Each registrant will receive a confirmation email and may then enter a submission via the ""Post a Submission"" tab at http://disability.challenge.gov . Submissions must be entered between May 23 at 12 a.m. EDT and Aug. 23 at 11:59 p.m. EDT. Late entries will not be eligible for prizes."

The committee will advise, consult with and make recommendations to the secretary of labor and the assistant secretary of labor for occupational safety and health on ways to improve the efficiency, effectiveness and transparency of OSHA's administration of whistleblower protections. ""Workers who expose securities and financial fraud, adulterated foods, air and water pollution, and workplace safety hazards have a legal right to speak out without fear of retaliation, and the laws that protect these whistleblowers also protect the health, safety and well-being of all Americans,"" said Dr. David Michaels, assistant secretary of labor for occupational safety and health. ""Establishing a federal advisory committee is another important effort to strengthen protections for whistleblowers."" In particular, the committee will advise OSHA on the development and implementation of improved customer service models, enhancements in the investigative and enforcement process, training, and regulations governing OSHA investigations. In addition, it will advise OSHA in cooperative activities with other federal agencies that are responsible for areas covered by the whistleblower protection statutes enforced by OSHA. ""This new Whistleblower Protection Advisory Committee will help our agency sustain an open dialogue with stakeholders and experts, and will promote the transparency and accountability that are the cornerstone of this administration,"" added Michaels. OSHA enforces the whistleblower provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Act and 20 other statutes protecting employees who report violations of various workplace, airline, commercial motor carrier, consumer product, environmental, financial reform, food safety, health care reform, nuclear, pipeline, public transportation agency, railroad, maritime and securities laws. Under these various whistleblower provisions enacted by Congress, employers are prohibited from retaliating against employees who raise various protected concerns or provide protected information to the employer or the government. Employees who believe that they have been retaliated against for engaging in protected conduct may file a complaint with the secretary of labor for an investigation by OSHA's Whistleblower Protection Program. Detailed information on employer whistleblower rights, including fact sheets, is available online at the newly revamped http://www.whistleblowers.gov .

"May 17, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20120517,"US Department of Labors MSHA files complaint against mining company in Thomaston, ME, to reinstate miner unlawfully discharged","ARLINGTON, Va. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration has filed a complaint with the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission against Ferraiolo Construction Inc. to reinstate a worker to his former position and provide compensation for wages lost as a result of his being unlawfully fired. On Nov. 29, 2011, a complaint was filed with MSHA against Ferraiolo, alleging that the company had terminated the miner's employment on Sept. 30, 2011, at Thomaston, Maine-based Portable Pioneer Plant, in retaliation for his having made recurring safety complaints. MSHA investigated the complaint and found that the miner had engaged in protected activity when he alerted the company about unresolved safety problems, refused to turn on the plant's generator until required safety guards had been installed, and called MSHA to report the company's failure to install those safety guards. Portable Pioneer Plant is a stone crushing operation that produces gravel for use by the public and cement mills. MSHA seeks a finding from the Commission that Ferraiolo unlawfully discriminated against the worker in violation of Section 105(c) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, which states that miners, their representatives, and applicants for employment are protected from retaliation for engaging in safety and/or health-related activities, such as identifying hazards, asking for MSHA inspections, or refusing to engage in unsafe acts. More specifically, an administrative law judge from the Commission will determine whether the miner, a general laborer since 2007, had engaged in activities protected under the Mine Act, and whether Portable Pioneer Plant officials took adverse action against him in retaliation for those activities. In this case, MSHA is seeking an order requiring Ferraiolo to cease and desist from discharging or otherwise discriminating against the miner or any other miner because she or he engages in protected activity; remove from the miner's personnel file and other company records any adverse references to him arising from the events leading to the unlawful discharge; and extend an offer of reinstating the miner to his former position, along with the same rate of pay and benefits prior to his unlawful discharge. Additionally, MSHA seeks imposition of a $20,000 civil penalty. ""Every miner has the right to identify hazardous conditions and refuse unsafe work without fear of discrimination or retaliation,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""The Mine Act allows workers to exercise this right without fear of being fired, demoted, harassed, transferred, refused employment or suffering any loss of wages."" ""A Guide to Miners' Rights and Responsibilities Under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977"" is available on MSHA's website at http://www.msha.gov/S&HINFO/minersrights/minersrights.asp ."

"May 16, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20120516,US Department of Labor alleges Idaho plan administrator misused funds,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Labor has filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho against Matthew D. Hutcheson alleging that he violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The complaint alleges that, toward the end of 2010, Hutcheson used more than $3.2 million representing the retirement plan savings of workers from multiple employers for his own personal expenses and in an attempt to purchase an interest in the Tamarack Resort — a failed ski and golf resort in Idaho. This prohibited transaction has left affected retirement plans without sufficient funds to pay participants all the benefits owed to them. Hutcheson also faces a separate criminal indictment, which was filed in the same court on April 10, in connection with the same transaction. ""This is a case of a fiduciary violating the trust of retirement plan participants who relied on him to invest and grow their hard-earned savings,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Employee Benefits Security Phyllis C. Borzi. ""The Labor Department is taking all actions necessary to recover money for workers who are counting on these savings for a secure retirement."" The department also has filed an application for a temporary restraining order and for an order to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not be granted. The department seeks to remove Hutcheson and other named defendants as fiduciaries of the affected plans, and to appoint an independent fiduciary to administer the plans. In addition to Hutcheson, defendants include Hutcheson Walker Advisors LLC; Green Valley Holdings LLC; and the Retirement Security Plan and Trust, formerly known as the Pension Liquidity Plan and Trust. The case was investigated by staff from the Labor Department's Employee Benefits Security Administration's Dallas Regional Office. The case is being litigated by the Labor Department's Office of the Solicitor in Washington, D.C.

Hovensa was the largest private employer in the U.S. Virgin Islands and operated one of the largest oil refineries in the Western Hemisphere.

""The federal funding announced today will provide re-employment services to help individuals impacted by the layoffs find good jobs in high-growth industries."" In February, the refinery ceased all operations, resulting in layoffs of 1,158 workers employed directly by Hovensa and many more employed by 17 of the company's contractors. ""Today's announcement reflects the Labor Department's commitment to address the effects of Hovensa's closure on the St. Croix community and the federal interagency collaboration needed to address the challenges faced by all U.S. territories,"" said Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar, whose assistant secretary for insular affairs, Tony Babauta, co-chairs with the White House the Interagency Group on Insular Areas.

"May 14, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20120514,US Department of Labor action restores nearly $1.3 million to employee pension plan,"LOS ANGELES — The U.S. Department of Labor has reached an agreement with a California fruit and nut company to restore a total of $1,287,901 to the company's pension plan. In a consent judgment entered this month in the U.S. District Court's Central District in Los Angeles, officers of Los Angeles-based Western Mixers Inc. agreed to restore $802,901to participants' accounts within 10 days. During the course of the investigation leading up to the lawsuit, the company repaid to the plan $485,000 of the total funds identified as missing. The consent judgment fully recovers unpaid contributions and unauthorized withdrawals, plus interest. The agreement follows an investigation by the Los Angeles Regional Office of the Labor Department's Employee Benefits Security Administration. The investigation determined that, over a five-year period, the company and two officers who served as trustees of the plan failed to make approximately $952,511 in mandatory employer contributions for the benefit of participants and beneficiaries. Investigators also found that the same two officers as well as the company's chief financial officer made $565,000 in unauthorized withdrawals from the plan accounts, comingling those funds in the company's general accounts and using them for the benefit of the business. In addition to repaying the missing funds with interest, the defendants will be assessed a penalty equal to 20 percent of the recovered amount. ""This case demonstrates a clear breach of fiduciary duty,"" said Phyllis C. Borzi, assistant secretary of labor for employee benefits security. ""Employers hold positions of trust that are violated when money intended for retirement benefits is directed to some other use. Individual trustees have a duty to protect a retirement plan and, as in this case, may be personably liable for the funds. The Labor Department is committed to protecting workers' retirement funds so that they can continue to provide for themselves and their families during retirement."" The department's Regional Office of the Solicitor litigated this case. The court has appointed an independent fiduciary to terminate the plan and to collect, marshal, pay out and administer plan assets. Frank L. Rudy and David H. Bolstad, owners of the company, are removed as plan trustees and fiduciaries. Together with Robert J. Fischer, Western Mixers' chief financial officer, they are permanently enjoined and restrained from violating the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and from serving as fiduciary or service providers to any ERISA-covered plan in the future. Western Mixers distributes nuts, dried fruits, beans, rice and other produce to retail outlets nationwide, including grocery stores and major warehouse chains. EBSA protects the security of the retirement, health and other workplace-related benefits of America's workers, retirees and their families.

Solis during a ceremony at the department's headquarters in Washington. The secretary of labor's Honor Awards are the highest level of recognition for employees whose work and accomplishments achieve an outstanding level and demonstrate excellence in promoting the department's mission in all of the goals set by the secretary. As a tribute to the exceptional efforts of the secretary's honorees, the Gary Job Corps students made medallions out of bare bronze metal, which is prized in metalworking for its performance strength and durability. Display boxes for the medallions were made out of hard pecan and walnut lumber. Each award was completed with a patriotic red, white and blue ribbon. The awards, which were made at no cost to taxpayers, were made as part of a training project and crafted from available materials in workshops. In the case of the display boxes, recycled wood was used, in keeping with the department's ""green"" environmental initiatives. The secretary has long been a champion of the department's Job Corps program as an educational and training opportunity for disadvantaged youth, and has turned to its students in the past to produce important departmental awards. These include hand-made mementos produced by Job Corps students in Cleveland, Ohio, that were given by the secretary to foreign finance ministers who attended the 2010 G20 Summit meetings. Students from the Westover Job Corps Center in Massachusetts used coal-like materials in honor of the miners who were killed by the explosion at the Upper Big Branch Mine in West Virginia to recognize the department's first responders and rescue teams. A Guthrie, Okla., Job Corps student created a unique picture award depicting the beauty of the Gulf Coast, which was given to employees in recognition of their outstanding efforts and service to help those in the Gulf Region impacted by the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill. ""Young people have been hit the hardest in unemployment and that is why the Job Corps program is so vital,"" Secretary Solis said, adding, ""Job Corps is the nation's largest career technical training and education program for young people, and offers hands-on training in more than 100 career technical areas including some of the fastest growing job sectors, such as health care, information technology and renewable energy. Job Corps is a sound investment in preparing our young people to become a well-skilled, productive workforce."" During today's ceremony, Solis presented the awards to dozens of the department's employees in recognition of their outstanding displays of professionalism, teamwork and dedication on various issues ranging from recovering workers' compensation funds and ensuring mine emergency systems compliance to developing a user-friendly Unemployment Insurance portal and implementing jobs clubs for unemployed workers. The department honored employees from a number of its agencies including the Office of the Solicitor, Mine Safety and Health Administration, Bureau of International Labor Affairs, Office of Administrative Law Judges, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs, Employee Benefits Security Administration, Employment and Training Administration, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration and Management, Center for Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships, Office of Inspector General, Office of Labor-Management Standards and Office of Public Affairs. In future regional ceremonies, employees from the following agencies also will receive medallions: the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, Wage and Hour Division, Bureau of Labor Statistics and Veterans' Employment and Training Service. ""These awards are a daily reminder that the Department of Labor's employees have dedicated themselves to improving the lives of all Americans through work that is hard, urgent and at times thankless,"" Secretary Solis said. ""Whether it is protecting our workplaces, safeguarding our pensions, or offering educational and training opportunities, the Department of Labor touches the lives of every single American every single day,"" she said. About the Gary Job Corps Center and the Secretary of Labor Award Design Job Corps, administered by the Labor Department's Employment and Training Administration, serves approximately 60,000 young people ages 16 through 24 each year at 125 centers in 48 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Students from Gary's machining, carpentry, and arts and crafts programs came together as a team to design and craft what the award should look like, be composed of and symbolize. Under the direction of machining instructors Saysamone Manyseng – a 1984 Gary graduate – and Bob Costa, machining students used a power saw to cut a 6-foot-long bare bronze metal bar stock into 50 pieces. Each piece was individually ""faced"" using both a manual mill and lathe. A computer numerical control, or CNC, milling machine was used to profile and engrave the awards. The slot for the ribbon was cut with a 1/8-inch bit. Each piece was polished to a high-shine finish. Carpentry students, under the direction of instructors Joe Nazarene and Nelson Beard, created two-piece display boxes for each award, using pecan and walnut lumber that was cut on table and miter saws. After the boxes were sanded to a smooth surface, arts and crafts program students helped line the boxes with felt and attached patriotic red, white and blue ribbons to each.

The U.S. Department of Labor has cited Wilmington, Mass.-based UniFirst Corp., a uniform and laundry service, for three willful and four serious safety and health violations, including some involving bloodborne pathogen and lead exposure hazards, at its West Caldwell facility. A complaint alleging hazards prompted OSHA's inspection. Proposed penalties total $186,000. ""The violations at this facility compromise the safety and health of UniFirst's workers,"" said Kris Hoffman, director of OSHA's Parsippany Area Office, which conducted the inspection. ""It is vital that the company take appropriate steps to eliminate all identified hazards."" Three willful violations involve a failure to conduct proper training and provide hepatitis B vaccinations, as well as to have engineering and work practice controls in place to eliminate or minimize exposure to bloodborne pathogens. A willful violation is one committed with intentional knowing or voluntary disregard for the law's requirements, or with plain indifference to worker safety and health. The citations carry $165,000 in penalties. Four serious violations involve a locked emergency door, a lack of training on fire extinguisher use, lead-contaminated surfaces, inadequate training on OSHA's lead standard and not providing gloves to workers exposed to potentially contaminated clothing. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known. The citations carry $21,000 in penalties. ""A first step toward a safer, healthier workplace is to develop and implement an illness and injury prevention program in which management and workers proactively identify and eliminate hazardous conditions,"" said Robert Kulick, OSHA's regional director in New York. The citations can be viewed at http://www.osha.gov/ooc/citations/UnifirstCorporation_315956458_04_12.pdf .

"May 9, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20120509,US Labor Department kicks off summer campaign to prevent heat-related illnesses and fatalities among outdoor workers,"Educational materials and mobile application available HONOLULU – The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration has cited GM Logistics in Guam for five alleged serious and one other-than-serious safety violation following an inspection that was prompted by a Nov. 16, 2011, workplace fatality. Barrigada-based GM Logistics collects scrap metal for recycling. The fatality occurred while the crew was preparing to transport a 40-foot-long bus from a privately owned lot to the Formosa Recycling Facility in Harmon. The employee had attempted to jump out of a forklift that was tipping over, and was crushed. ""This fatality could have been prevented had the employer ensured that everyone was abiding by OSHA's forklift safety standards,"" said Galen Lemke, director of OSHA's Honolulu Area Office. ""Instead, a family and a community have suffered an irreplaceable loss."" The serious violations involve permitting employees to operate the forklift without using a seat belt; not examining the forklift for defects prior to operation; allowing the operation of the forklift despite obvious and serious defects affecting the accelerator and steering mechanism, as well as leaking steering fluid and unreadable safety information affixed to the equipment. Additionally, the employer was unable to document whether the worker who was killed had received the required forklift operation and safety training. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known. The other-than-serious violation is failing to report the fatality to OSHA within eight hours. An other-than-serious violation is one that has a direct relationship to job safety and health, but probably would not cause death or serious physical harm. The citations carry proposed penalties totaling $19,800. GM Logistics has 15 business days from receipt of its citations and proposed penalties to comply, meet with OSHA's area director or contest the findings to the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. Detailed information on forklift operation hazards and safeguards is available at http://www.osha.gov/dcsp/products/etools/pit/. To ask questions, obtain compliance assistance, file a complaint, or report workplace hospitalizations, fatalities or situations posing imminent danger to workers, the public should call OSHA's toll-free hotline at 800-321-OSHA (6742) or the agency's Honolulu office at 808-541-2680. Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. OSHA's role is to ensure these conditions for America's working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education and assistance.

"May 8, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/odep/odep20120508,US Labor Departments Office of Disability Employment Policy announces 2012 theme for National Disability Employment Awareness Month,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Labor's Office of Disability Employment Policy today announced the official theme for October's National Disability Employment Awareness Month: ""A Strong Workforce is an Inclusive Workforce: What Can YOU Do?"" The theme promotes the benefits of a diverse workforce that includes workers with disabilities, who represent a highly skilled talent pool. ""Employers who ensure that inclusive workplace policies and practices are woven into the fabric and culture of the organization create an environment that encourages all workers — including those of us with disabilities — to work to their full capacity and contribute fully to the organization's success,"" said Kathy Martinez, assistant secretary of labor for disability employment policy. Early announcement of the theme helps communities nationwide plan a series of announcements, events and meetings to begin in October, some of which will continue throughout the year. Such activities include proclamations, public awareness programs and job fairs that showcase the skills and talents of workers with disabilities. As background, Public Law 176, enacted by Congress in 1945, designated the first week in October each year as ""National Employ the Physically Handicapped Week."" President Harry S. Truman designated the President's Committee on Employment of People with Disabilities to carry out the observance. In 1962, the word ""physically"" was removed from the week's name to acknowledge the employment needs of all Americans with disabilities. In 1988, Congress expanded the week to a month and changed its name to ""National Disability Awareness Month,"" which eventually evolved to its current name. The Labor Department's Office of Disability Employment Policy took over responsibility for National Disability Employment Awareness Month in 2001. Members of the public with questions related to the 2012 theme should contact Carol Dunlap in ODEP at 202-693-7902. The media should contact Bennett Gamble using the information above. ODEP's mission is to provide national leadership by developing and influencing disability-related policies and practices to increase the employment of people with disabilities."
"May 7, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20120507-0,US Labor Department kicks off summer campaign to prevent heat-related illnesses and fatalities among outdoor workers,"Educational materials and mobile application available WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration has kicked off a national outreach initiative to educate workers and their employers about the hazards of working outdoors in hot weather. The outreach effort builds on last year's successful summer campaign to raise awareness about the dangers of too much sun and heat. ""For outdoor workers, 'water, rest and shade' are three words that can make the difference between life and death,"" Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis said. ""If employers take reasonable precautions, and look out for their workers, we can beat the heat."" Every year, thousands of workers across the country suffer from serious heat-related illnesses. If not quickly addressed, heat exhaustion can become heat stroke, which has killed – on average – more than 30 workers annually since 2003. Labor-intensive activities in hot weather can raise body temperatures beyond the level that normally can be cooled by sweating. Heat illness initially may manifest as heat rash or heat cramps, but quickly can become heat exhaustion and then heat stroke if simple prevention steps are not followed. ""It is essential for workers and employers to take proactive steps to stay safe in extreme heat, and become aware of symptoms of heat exhaustion before they get worse,"" said Dr. David Michaels, assistant secretary of labor for occupational safety and health. ""Agriculture workers; building, road and other construction workers; utility workers; baggage handlers; roofers; landscapers; and others who work outside are all at risk. Drinking plenty of water and taking frequent breaks in cool, shaded areas are incredibly important in the hot summer months."" In preparation for the summer season, OSHA has developed heat illness educational materials in English and Spanish, as well as a curriculum to be used for workplace training. Additionally, a Web page provides information and resources on heat illness – including how to prevent it and what to do in case of an emergency – for workers and employers. The page is available at http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/heatillness/ . OSHA also has released a free application for mobile devices that enables workers and supervisors to monitor the heat index at their work sites. The app displays a risk level for workers based on the heat index, as well as reminders about protective measures that should be taken at that risk level. Available for Android-based platforms and the iPhone, the app can be downloaded in both English and Spanish by visiting http://s.dol.gov/RI. In developing last year's inaugural national campaign, federal OSHA worked closely with the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration and adapted materials from that state's successful campaign. Additionally, OSHA is partnering with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for the second year to incorporate worker safety precautions when heat alerts are issued across the nation. NOAA also will include pertinent worker safety information on its heat watch Web page at http://www.noaawatch.gov/themes/heat.php (link is external) . Read this news release en Espa ol ."
"May 7, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20120507,US Department of Labor awards grant increment to provide re-employment assistance for Iowa workers affected by layoffs at Electrolux,"WASHINGTON The U.S. Department of Labor today awarded a National Emergency Grant supplement of $448,197 to provide re-employment services to about 713 workers affected by layoffs at Electrolux in Jefferson and Webster City, Iowa, and three of its suppliers in Ames and Webster City, Iowa. ""Any time a major employer shuts its doors, communities suffer,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""The additional federal funding announced today will help support these workers and their community by providing continued training and job placement assistance."" Awarded to Iowa Workforce Development, the grant increment will provide eligible workers with access to training and support, in conjunction with other services they may receive as a result of their eligibility for Trade Adjustment Assistance benefits. In July 2008, Electrolux began moving its operations from Jefferson and Webster City to Juarez, Mexico. In February 2009, the company announced it was moving all manufacturing operations to Juarez and transferring all distribution operations to an existing distribution center in El Paso, Texas. The layoffs occurred between May 2008 and June 2011. A National Emergency Grant was awarded on Aug. 25, 2010, for up to $1,352,776. Half of that amount was released initially and the second half was awarded on Oct. 14, 2011. Today's supplemental funding brings the total amount awarded to date to $1,800,973. National Emergency Grants are part of the secretary of labor's discretionary fund and are awarded based on a state's ability to meet specific guidelines.

The settlement resolves litigation that followed citations carrying $589,200 in fines issued by the department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration in October 2011 after OSHA inspections identified widespread fall and laceration hazards at the stores. ""This enterprisewide settlement is significant because DeMoulas has agreed not only to correct the hazards cited during OSHA's inspections but also to enact effective and ongoing systemic changes that will benefit all its employees,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health Dr. David Michaels. DeMoulas initially contested the citations to the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. The Labor Department's regional solicitor's office subsequently filed a complaint with the commission asking for enterprisewide correction of the hazards. As the result of settlement discussions with the solicitor's office, DeMoulas has signed the agreement to correct the cited hazards and take additional preventive actions. ""DeMoulas has agreed to a comprehensive and responsible settlement that corrects past hazards and paves the way for improvements which, effectively implemented and maintained, will significantly minimize hazards and enhance workplace safety and health for employees throughout the company,"" said Michael Felsen, the department's regional solicitor for New England. These improvements include a full-time safety and health director with the full authority and responsibility to develop, implement, monitor and enforce the requirements of the company's safety and health program; a written safety and health program for each workplace that will include inspections to monitor and evaluate the program's effectiveness as well as provisions to identify, document and remedy any hazards or violations; a written disciplinary program for all workplaces and all employees, including management; a safety and health liaison for each supermarket department; formal safety and health training for all new employees and all new and existing employees on an annual basis; and the inclusion of a safety and health evaluation as a material element in annual performance reviews of all store and department managers.

""Today's grant announcement will allow states to provide personalized assessments for recipients of Unemployment Insurance to help them get back on their feet faster,"" said Labor Secretary Hilda L. Solis. The funds will be used to conduct in-person assessments in One-Stop Career Centers. The assessments include the development of a re-employment plan for claimants, the provision of labor market information that is appropriate to the claimants' locations and employment prospects, a complete review of claimants' eligibility for Unemployment Insurance benefits, and a referral to re-employment services and/or training provided by the One-Stop Career Centers separate that is from the UI program. This is the eighth year that the Labor Department has awarded grants through its Re-employment and Eligibility Assessment initiative. Recent evaluations of REA programs have shown that REAs reduce the number of weeks UI benefits are claimed by expediting the re-employment of the UI claimants. This evidence justifies expanding the use of REAs as provided for in the federal Emergency Unemployment Compensation program, which is authorized by the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012. ""These grants allow us to bring UI beneficiaries into the One-Stop Career Center where they are introduced to all of the re-employment services that are available. REA participants get the best available help needed to find good jobs,"" said Jane Oates, assistant secretary of labor for employment and training. Two new states, Pennsylvania and Wyoming, are receiving grants to implement REA programs, while 38 states plus Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia are being awarded additional funds to continue their programs.

A set of frequently asked questions and answers is published in Field Assistance Bulletin No. 2012-02. ""This guidance will help both plan administrators and covered service providers comply with their obligations under the department's new fee-transparency rules, so that workers who make their own investment decisions in retirement plans will have the information they need to make informed investment choices,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for EBSA Phyllis C. Borzi. ""We also are working on a second set of frequently asked questions and answers focused more narrowly on the new rules for disclosure by covered service providers."" On October 20, 2010, the department published a final rule to help America's workers manage the money they have contributed to their 401(k) accounts, or similar retirement plan accounts, by requiring the disclosure of information regarding the fees and expenses associated with their plans. This participant-level disclosure rule, under section 404(a) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), also ensures that workers receive core investment information in a format that enables them to meaningfully compare their plan's investment options. A second and related fee transparency rule requires, in part, that certain covered service providers furnish specified information to plan administrators so that they in turn can comply with their disclosure obligations to participants. This second rule, published by the department on February 3, 2012, under section 408(b)(2) of ERISA, requires disclosures to employers sponsoring pension and 401(k) plans about the administrative and investment costs associated with providing such plans to their workers. The guidance responds to frequently asked questions about these rules and is intended to assist covered service providers and plan administrators with implementation.

"May 4, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20120504,Statement by Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis on April employment numbers,"WASHINGTON – Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis issued the following statement on the April 2012 Employment Situation report released today: ""Our nation's labor market added 130,000 private sector jobs in the month of April, while the unemployment rate fell to 8.1 percent, its lowest level in three years. ""Over the last four months, we've added an average of 207,000 private sector jobs. Significantly, the labor market added 53,000 more private sector jobs in February and March than previously had been reported. ""I would characterize our growth as durable and steady. For 26 straight months, we have added private sector jobs. The national unemployment rate has fallen a full point in the last eight months. Layoffs are continuing to come down and are now back to 2006 levels. ""In April, our largest gains – 62,000 new jobs – were in good-paying business and professional services careers, meaning more architects, engineers, computer programmers and consultants are finding jobs. Also, we added another 19,000 manufacturing jobs in April. After losing millions of good manufacturing jobs in the years before and during the deep recession, the economy has added 485,000 manufacturing jobs in the past 26 months. ""We've now created more than 4.2 million private sector jobs under this administration. We are seeing a resilient U.S. labor market continuing to recover from the deepest recession since the Great Depression. But there are still too many unemployed workers who still need assistance to get retrained to get back to work. ""We're on the right path, and we know our recovery would be even stronger if Congress hadn't blocked almost every single proposed investment in the American Jobs Act. The president believes we should be doing more to help state and local governments hire back teachers, policemen, firefighters and construction crews. And he believes we should be doing more to cut taxes on small businesses that are the engine of economic growth. ""Going forward, we have a choice to make. We can either make investments in things like education, transportation and new sources of energy – investments that have always been essential to America's businesses and to creating good middle class jobs. Or we give more tax breaks to wealthy Americans who don't need them and didn't ask for them. ""Prosperity has never just trickled down from a wealthy few. Prosperity has always grown from the heart of a strong middle class. That's why the president laid out a blueprint for an economy that's built to last, based on investments that put America in control of its energy future, improve education and skills for our workers, and support small business and American manufacturing, so we can make more things the world buys."""

"May 2, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20120502,"We Can't Wait: White House announces nearly 300,000 summer jobs and other employment opportunities for youth and new online tool to help youth access opportunities","PHILADELPHIA – Today, Secretary Solis will join Mayor Nutter at Philadelphia's City Hall to announce that the administration has secured additional commitments from 95 companies and nonprofits, three cities, two federal agencies and the White House to provide 110,000 new summer jobs and other employment opportunities for low-income and disconnected youth this year as part of the Summer Jobs+ initiative for a total of nearly 300,000 opportunities. Employment opportunities include 90,000 paid jobs and thousands of mentorships, internships and other training opportunities. The administration will also launch the Summer Jobs+ Bank , a new online search tool to help connect young people to jobs, internships and other employment opportunities this summer and year-round. ""In January, we called on the private and public sectors to help us address record unemployment among America's youth. Today, we are proud to announce that cities, federal agencies, nonprofits, and companies from across the country have come together to provide hundreds of thousands of summer jobs and employment opportunities for our young people,"" said President Obama. ""The Summer Jobs+ Bank and the growing list of organizations stepping up to answer the president's challenge are important to maintaining our commitment to the next generation of the American workforce,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis. ""There's no replacement for the dignity that comes with earning your first paycheck, and whether young people are looking for a job at the retail store around the corner – or at a national park states away – they now have one place to start their search."" The president proposed $1.5 billion for high-impact summer jobs and year-round employment for low-income youth ages 16-24 in the American Jobs Act as part of the Pathways Back to Work fund. When Congress failed to act, the federal government and private sector came together in January to commit to creating nearly 180,000 employment opportunities for low-income youth in the summer of 2012, with a goal of reaching 250,000 employment opportunities by the start of summer. Since the announcement of the initiative in January, nearly 100 more private sector partners nationwide have answered the president's challenge to provide young people summer jobs, mentorships, internships and other opportunities to build skills. As pathways to careers, summer employment is critical to the success of young people, good for business and important for our country. But today's youth are struggling to get the work experience they need for the jobs of the future: last summer, the unemployment rate among youth ages 16-24 set a near-record high, and only 21 out of 100 low-income teens had a job. According to a recent report , taxpayers shouldered more than $93 billion in direct costs and lost tax revenue to support young adults disconnected from school and work in 2011 alone. Summer Jobs+ Bank Working with 10 job posting websites and employers across the country, the Summer Jobs+ Bank provides a single-stop resource for young job seekers to go online and search for jobs and other employment opportunities in their communities. Modeled after the Veterans Job Bank, the Summer Jobs+ Bank is powered by a new open Web standard, the JobPosting schema , designed by a voluntary network of job search and technology companies and supported by http://www.schema.org . Job Posting Partners include: AboutJobs.com Inc., AfterCollege.com, Campus2Careers.com, CollegeRecruiter.com, CoolWorks.com, DirectEmployers Association, InternMatch.com, Internships.com, JobOn and LinkedIn. In addition to the search tool, the administration challenged the developer community to build apps that connect even more young people to job opportunities in their area. In response to the challenge, many apps were created on several of the leading platforms, including Facebook, Google Android, Apple iOS, Windows Phone and Web browsers. Learn more about these innovative apps here . Summer Jobs+ Cities Three cities have joined with the administration as Summer Jobs+ Cities and have committed to create new jobs, internships and other employment opportunities for low-income and disconnected youth this year. They include: Philadelphia : In response to the president's call to action, Mayor Michael A. Nutter and the city of Philadelphia, in partnership with Philadelphia Youth Network , is challenging Philadelphians and the business community to provide 7,500 youth summer jobs in 2012. At the event with Secretary Solis today, Mayor Nutter will announce commitments from local businesses and make a general call to Philadelphia citizens to join the Save Summer Jobs campaign . In addition to increasing employer-paid jobs and internships this year, Mayor Nutter is asking Philadelphians to sign on as donors – with personal contributions as small as $5 – to help reach the summer jobs goal. Chicago : The city of Chicago responded to the president's call to action by committing to provide 973 new summer job opportunities for students through a partnership with Chicago Public Schools. CPS students will develop transferable skills to increase employability through job readiness training. Nearly half of these opportunities will be explicitly directed towards students at risk of academic failure. San Francisco : San Francisco Mayor Lee, in partnership with United Way of the Bay Area, has responded to the president's call to action by committing to provide 5,000 jobs and internships for youth ages 14 – 24. Mayor Lee challenged corporate partners to match the city's 2,500 summer jobs with 2,500 new job and internship opportunities for summer 2012. The mayor's office is also partnering with the Department of Children, Youth and their Families, Office of Economic & Workforce Development and San Francisco Unified School District to create a pipeline between youth, community organizations and private sector employers. The United Way and local youth workforce development organizations will provide work readiness training and support to youth job seekers, matching them to employers.

"May 1, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20120501,"US Department of Labor recovers $4.83 million in back wages, damages for more than 4,500 Wal-Mart workers","Misapplied exemption resulted in pay violations; nearly $464,000 assessed in penalties WASHINGTON — Wal-Mart Stores Inc., headquartered in Bentonville, Ark., has agreed to pay $4,828,442 in back wages and damages to more than 4,500 employees nationwide following an investigation by the U.S. Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division that found violations of the federal Fair Labor Standards Act's overtime provisions. Additionally, Wal-Mart will pay $463,815 in civil money penalties. The violations affected current and former vision center managers and asset protection coordinators at Wal-Mart Discount Stores, Wal-Mart Supercenters, Neighborhood Markets and Sam's Club warehouses. Wal-Mart failed to compensate these employees with overtime pay, considering them to be exempt from the FLSA's overtime requirements. The Labor Department's investigation found that the employees are nonexempt and consequently due overtime pay for any hours worked beyond 40 in a week. ""Misclassification of employees as exempt from FLSA coverage is a costly problem with adverse consequences for employees and corporations,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""Let this be a signal to other companies that when violations are found, the Labor Department will take appropriate action to ensure that workers receive the wages they have earned."" Under the terms of the settlement, Wal-Mart has agreed to pay all back wages the department determined are owed for the violations in addition to paying liquidated damages to the employees and a penalty to the department. The civil money penalties assessed stem from the repeat nature of the violations. Wal-Mart, which operates more than 3,900 establishments in the United States, corrected its classification practices for these workers in 2007, and negotiation over the back pay issues has been ongoing since that time. A third-party administrator will disburse the payments to the affected employees. ""Our department has been working with Wal-Mart for a long time to reach this agreement,"" said Nancy J. Leppink, deputy administrator of the Wage and Hour Division. ""I am very pleased that staff in our Southwest region persevered, ensured these employees will be paid the back wages they are owed and brought this case to conclusion. Thanks to this resolution, thousands of employees will see money put back into their pockets that should have been there all along. The damages and penalties assessed in this case should put other employers on notice that they cannot avoid their obligations to their employees by inappropriately classifying their workers as exempt."" The FLSA provides an exemption from both minimum wage and overtime pay requirements for individuals employed in bona fide executive, administrative, professional and outside sales positions, as well as certain computer employees. To qualify for exemption, employees generally must meet certain tests regarding their job duties and be paid on a salary basis at not less than $455 per week. Job titles do not determine exempt status. In order for an exemption to apply, an employee's specific job duties and salary must meet all the requirements of the department's regulations. The FLSA requires that covered, nonexempt employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 for all hours worked, plus time and one-half their regular rates, including commissions, bonuses and incentive pay, for hours worked beyond 40 per week. Employers also are required to maintain accurate time and payroll records. The civil money penalties assessed stem from the repeat nature of the violations.

"April 30, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20120430,MSHA announces results of March impact inspections,"ARLINGTON, Va. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration today announced that federal inspectors issued 249 violations during special impact inspections conducted at nine coal mines and two metal/nonmetal mines last month. The coal mines were issued 187 citations, 25 orders and two safeguards, while the metal/nonmetal operations were issued 35 citations. These inspections, which began in force in April 2010 following the explosion at the Upper Big Branch Mine, involve mines that merit increased agency attention and enforcement due to their poor compliance history or particular compliance concerns, including high numbers of violations or closure orders; frequent hazard complaints or hotline calls; plan compliance issues; inadequate workplace examinations; a high number of accidents, injuries or illnesses; fatalities; and adverse conditions such as increased methane liberation, faulty roof conditions and inadequate ventilation. As an example of the most recent impact inspections, beginning on the evening shift March 13 and continuing past midnight into March 14, MSHA visited Redhawk Mining LLC, Redhawk #1 Mine in Floyd County, Ky. Federal inspectors secured mine communications upon arrival to prevent advance notification underground. The enforcement team examined four conveyer belt lines on four mechanized mining units, or MMUs. This mine has a history of liberating methane and had been put on notice by MSHA that greater efforts to comply with the approved ventilation plan were needed. Inspectors found that required air quantities in idle and active coal faces, as approved in the mine's ventilation plan, were not being maintained, and the type and number of water sprays for respirable dust control were not in compliance. For example, the operator failed to use a line curtain, nine of the 27 water sprays were the wrong type, one spray was plugged and six others were improperly oriented. Properly maintained and operating dust controls are critical in preventing miners from contracting diseases associated with the inhalation of respirable coal mine dust such as pneumoconiosis, silicosis, bronchitis and emphysema. Inspectors found that mine examiners failed to conduct adequate on-shift examinations during the production shift. Many obvious and extensive hazards were identified on the active MMUs, including accumulations of combustible material in the form of loose coal and coal dust, not maintaining the approved dust control parameters and not complying with the approved ventilation plan. The mine was shut down for 72 hours. These deficiencies appear to have existed for an extended period. All mine examiners subsequently were trained on proper examinations and monitored by MSHA personnel, and the entire workforce was trained on the new ventilation plan. Approved ventilation plans are designed to control methane liberation, protect miners from black lung and prevent the risk of frictional methane face ignitions. ""The closure order is still one of the most effective tools inspectors have to bring about compliance, even during impact inspections,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""We will not hesitate to use these and other enforcement tools to protect the nation's miners."" As a second example from last month's impact inspections, also on March 13, MSHA arrived during the second shift at Perry County Coal Corp.'s E3-1 Mine in Perry County, Ky. The mine was on a 5-day spot inspection for methane liberation in excess of 1 million cubic feet per 24 hours. Inspectors traveled to one of its two portals and secured the guard shack and mine office while another inspector traveled to the second portal and secured the communication system there. The rest of the inspection party traveled underground in two different directions along belt conveyors to each of two producing MMUs. MSHA issued the operator 38 citations and 16 unwarrantable failure orders, including for accumulations of combustible materials 14 times during the inspection. Accumulations of combustible materials were extensive in all mine areas where inspectors traveled and included both MMUs, multiple belt conveyors, escapeways, track entries, a return aircourse and equipment. At one MMU, accumulations of combustible materials in the form of loose coal, coal dust and float coal dust were black in color, dry to the touch and ranged in depth from paper thin to 3 feet from the section loading point to the face area (360 feet), as well as on the mine floor and ribs in all areas of the section. No effort had been made to control the dust, apply rock dust or remove the accumulations. It was evident that combustible materials had been allowed to accumulate for several shifts. The accumulation of combustible materials, if left unchecked, and in concert with other conditions such as high methane liberation, could potentially cause a mine fire or explosion. The operator did not comply with a wide range of standards and demonstrated overall noncompliance with mine safety and health regulations intended to protect miners and provide for safe and healthful working conditions. Additional citations and orders were issued for failure to comply with the roof control plan, as well as to maintain belt rollers and conveyor belts, firefighting equipment and deluge water sprays, and permissible electric face equipment. The operator also was cited regarding inadequate examinations for hazards that clearly had existed for some time with no effort taken to correct them. Since April 2010, MSHA has conducted 431 impact inspections at coal and metal/nonmetal mines. These inspections have resulted in 7,642 citations, 757 orders and 28 safeguards for a total of 8,427 issuances.

"April 27, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20120427,Statement by Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis on Workers Memorial Day,"WASHINGTON – Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis today issued the following statement on the observance of Workers' Memorial Day: ""Tomorrow, April 28, is Workers' Memorial Day, an occasion for reflection and remembrance of the thousands of workers who needlessly have suffered fatal injuries on the job every year. We also think of those workers who have been seriously injured or sickened as a result of preventable workplace hazards. ""We are never prepared to say goodbye to the people we love, but we are even less so when we send our loved ones off for a day's work. It is our duty to ensure that all workers come home safely at the end of each workday, and we stand behind our firm conviction that workplace injuries and fatalities are entirely preventable. ""On this day, I urge all Americans to raise their voices in support of workers' right to a safe and healthful workplace. In the 41 years since the Occupational Safety and Health Act was enacted, we have made tremendous progress, but our steadfast mission to make every job in America a safe job must continue. One workplace death is too many. ""Making a living shouldn't include dying."""
"April 26, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20120426,Labor Departments MSHA issues user notice regarding SCSR units,"Phase-out of CSE SR-100 breathing devices in underground mines to begin immediately ARLINGTON, Va. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration today announced that mine operators must immediately begin phasing out the use of SR-100 self-contained self-rescuers manufactured by Pittsburgh, Pa.-based CSE Corp. The announcement, made in conjunction with the department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, was prompted by the April 13 NIOSH report of a joint NIOSH-MSHA investigation that determined the units do not conform to safety requirements. Self-contained self-rescuers are portable devices that, in the event of an emergency, can provide underground miners with up to 60 minutes of breathable air. By April 26, 2013, mine operators are required to replace with any other approved one-hour SCSR those SR-100s that are worn or carried by miners and stored on mantrips. The entire phase-out of all SR-100 units must be completed by Dec. 31, 2013. ""Due to the large number of CSE SR-100s in underground coal mines, multiple SCSRs available to miners, the low probability of failure and the shortage of immediately available replacements, MSHA and NIOSH have determined that an orderly phase-out will better protect the safety of miners than immediate withdrawal of the devices,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. Following the identification of a potential problem with the starter oxygen system on two SR-100s by NIOSH and later by the manufacturer during routine quality control testing, an investigation was launched. The company voluntarily stopped selling the units, and additional safety protections and new training measures for miners were put in place to address the potential problem. NIOSH developed a protocol and began a testing process in October 2010 for the prevalence of failure of the oxygen starter and, along with MSHA, collected 500 of the approximately 70,000 units deployed in underground coal mines throughout the U.S. Five of those units proved defective, exceeding the maximum allowable failure rate of 1 percent, which includes a safety margin for error. MSHA and NIOSH jointly approve respirators for use in the nation's mines. At the time of the investigation, the SR-100 was one of three one-hour SCSR models in use. Under the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006, coal mine operators are required to provide additional SCSRs for each miner underground in areas such as working places, on mantrips, in escapeways and where outby crews work or travel. The rule also requires that SCSRs be readily accessible in the event of an emergency.

Solis observes Workers Memorial Day at Action Summit for Worker Safety and Health, announces fall prevention campaign","LOS ANGELES Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis today announced a new campaign led by the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration to prevent deadly falls in the construction industry. The awareness campaign will provide employers and workers with life-saving information and educational materials about working safely from ladders, scaffolds and roofs. In 2010, more than 10,000 construction workers were injured as a result of falling while working from heights, and another 255 workers were killed. Secretary Solis made the announcement at the Action Summit for Worker Safety and Health, which was held at East Los Angeles Community College as one of multiple events this week honoring Workers' Memorial Day. The Labor Department sponsored the summit in coordination with the University of California, Los Angeles' Labor Occupational Safety and Health program, and the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health. Workers' Memorial Day is observed annually on April 28 across the country to remember workers who lost their lives as a result of preventable injuries. ""The best way to honor Workers' Memorial Day is to make sure that another family does not have to suffer the pain of losing a loved one because of preventable workplace injuries,"" said Secretary Solis. ""Falls are the most fatal out of all hazards in the construction industry, accounting for almost one in every three construction worker deaths. Our simple message is that safety pays, and falls cost."" OSHA's fall prevention campaign was developed in partnership with the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health and NIOSH's National Occupational Research Agenda program. OSHA and NIOSH will work with trade associations, labor unions, employers, universities, community and faith-based organizations, and consulates to provide employers and workers – especially vulnerable, low-literacy workers – with education and training on common-sense fall prevention equipment and strategies that save lives. OSHA has created a new fall prevention Web page with detailed information in English and Spanish on fall protection standards at http://www.osha.gov/stopfalls . NIOSH and NORA also have created a page on the Centers for Disease Control website at www.cdc.gov/niosh/construction/stopfalls.html , as well as a joint website on fall prevention at www.stopconstructionfalls.com , which will be maintained by the Center for Construction Research and Training, that contains information from industry, nonprofit and academic sources. ""The busy summer months in the construction industry are upon us, and now is the time to ensure that workers and employers understand what is required to prevent falls,"" said Dr. David Michaels, assistant secretary of labor for occupational safety and health. ""When working at heights, everyone needs to plan ahead to get the job done safely, provide the right equipment and train workers to use the equipment safely."" Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. OSHA's role is to ensure these conditions for America's working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education and assistance.

"April 26, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20120426-0,Labor Department statement on withdrawal of proposed rule dealing with children who work in agricultural vocations,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Labor today issued the following statement regarding the withdrawal of a proposed rule dealing with children who work in agricultural vocations: ""The Obama administration is firmly committed to promoting family farmers and respecting the rural way of life, especially the role that parents and other family members play in passing those traditions down through the generations. The Obama administration is also deeply committed to listening and responding to what Americans across the country have to say about proposed rules and regulations. ""As a result, the Department of Labor is announcing today the withdrawal of the proposed rule dealing with children under the age of 16 who work in agricultural vocations. ""The decision to withdraw this rule — including provisions to define the 'parental exemption' — was made in response to thousands of comments expressing concerns about the effect of the proposed rules on small family-owned farms. To be clear, this regulation will not be pursued for the duration of the Obama administration. ""Instead, the Departments of Labor and Agriculture will work with rural stakeholders — such as the American Farm Bureau Federation, the National Farmers Union, the Future Farmers of America, and 4-H — to develop an educational program to reduce accidents to young workers and promote safer agricultural working practices."""
"April 26, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20120426,"Hawkins Tree and Landscaping in Shakopee, Minn., to pay $478,000 in back wages and damages to 57 workers, additional $22,000 in civil money penalties","SHAKOPEE, Minn. — Judge Susan Richard Nelson of the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota has entered a consent judgment against Hawkins Tree and Landscaping Inc., a Shakopee company, and its owners, Michael Hawkins and Dawn Hawkins, individually. The judgment orders payment of back wages and liquidated damages in the amount of $478,000 to 57 current and former laborers, drivers, crew leaders and foremen of the company for violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act. Hawkins Tree and Landscaping and its owners also have agreed to pay $22,000 in civil money penalties. ""The misclassification of employees as independent contractors is a serious threat to both workers, who are entitled to good and safe jobs, and to employers who obey the law and are undercut when others use illegal practices,"" said Nancy J. Leppink, deputy administrator for the Wage and Hour Division. ""The Department of Labor is committed to remedying employee misclassification and ensuring compliance to protect and enhance the welfare of the nation's workforce."" The consent judgment resolves a lawsuit that was filed by the Labor Department in 2010 after an investigation revealed that the company had failed to pay workers time and one-half their regular rates of pay for hours worked over 40 hours in a week. The company also failed to provide adequate records of hours worked and misclassified workers as independent contractors. The company and its owners have conceded all of the violations. Under the consent judgment, the court has entered a finding that the workers were employees of Hawkins and not independent contractors. The judgment also enjoins the company and its owners from any future FLSA violations. As terms of the consent agreement, Hawkins Tree and Landscaping must retain a certified public accounting firm to conduct bi-annual audits of its pay practices to determine compliance with the FLSA, as well as provide all employees information on the FLSA in English or Spanish. The misclassification of employees as independent contractors is an alarming trend, particularly in industries that often employ low-wage, vulnerable workers and in which the Wage and Hour Division historically has found significant wage violations. Too often, misclassified employees are deprived of overtime and minimum wages, and are forced to pay taxes that their employers are legally obligated to pay. The Labor Department is committed to ensuring that employees receive the pay and benefits to which they are legally entitled and to leveling the playing field for employers that play by the rules. Under the FLSA, an employment relationship must be distinguished from a strictly contractual one. An employee — as distinguished from a person who is engaged in a business of his or her own — is one who, as a matter of economic reality, follows the usual path of an employee and is dependent on the business that he or she serves. For more information, visit http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs13.htm . The FLSA requires that covered employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 for all hours worked, plus time and one-half their regular rates, including commissions, bonuses and incentive pay, for hours worked beyond 40 per week. Additionally, employers must maintain accurate time and payroll records. For more information about the FLSA, call the Wage and Hour Division's toll-free helpline at 866-4US-WAGE (487-9243).

"April 25, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20120425,US Labor Departments MSHA releases first quarter mine fatality update,"ARLINGTON, Va. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration today released a first quarter summary of mining deaths across the country. Ten miners died in work-related accidents at the nation's mines during the first three months of 2012. Six coal mining deaths occurred in the following categories: exploding vessels under pressure, drowning, handling materials, rib fall, machinery and electrical. An uncharacteristic trend identified over the quarter is that five of these fatalities – three of them involving mine supervisors – occurred on five consecutive weekends. Four mining deaths in the metal/nonmetal industry occurred from accidents involving powered haulage, a fall from an elevated walkway and, in two separate incidents, fall of material. ""Fatalities are preventable,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""Many mines operate every shift of every day, year in and year out, without a fatality or a lost-time injury."" Main noted that fatalities can be prevented by using effective safety and health management programs in the workplace. ""Workplace examinations for hazards – pre-shift and on-shift, every shift – can identify and eliminate hazards that kill and injure miners,"" he said. ""Providing effective and appropriate training will ensure that miners recognize and understand hazards and how to control or eliminate them."" MSHA has taken a number of actions to identify mines with health and safety problems, and has initiated several outreach and enforcement initiatives, including ""Rules to Live By,"" a fatality prevention program highlighting safety and health standards most frequently cited during fatal accident investigations. Last month, MSHA circulated an accident prevention alert to the mining industry in the wake of four consecutive weekends of mine fatalities. The following weekend, a fifth fatality occurred. An analysis of 2012's first quarter summary of mining fatalities is available on MSHA's website at http://www.msha.gov/fatals/summaries/summaries.asp , along with best practices to help mining operations avoid such fatalities."

The department's suit is based on an investigation conducted by its Employee Benefits Security Administration that found violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The suit names as a defendant Dennis Webb, the principal owner of Entrepreneurial Ventures Inc., which operates Parrot Cellular telephone retail stores in northern and central California, and is the sponsor of the worker retirement plan. EVI executives Matthew Fidiam and J. Robert Gallucci also are named as defendants, as is Consulting Fiduciaries Inc., an Illinois company that served as the independent fiduciary and investment manager for the ESOP during a November 2002 stock purchase by the ESOP. Both Parrot Cellular and EVI are headquartered at the same location in Campbell. The suit alleges that the defendants caused or permitted the ESOP to purchase EVI stock for more than fair market value and that Webb enriched himself by millions of dollars at the expense of the plan and its participants. ""Plan officials are required by law to manage the ESOP in a careful, prudent manner and to act solely to benefit the plan's participants,"" said Jean Ackerman, director of EBSA's San Francisco Regional Office, which conducted the investigation. ""This action underscores the department's commitment to protect the benefits that employers promise to their employees."" Investigators determined that the ESOP purchased approximately 90 percent of EVI stock for more than $28 million. Around the same time as the stock purchase, EVI also set aside $4 million pursuant to a deferred compensation agreement with Webb and entered into a second executive compensation agreement with Webb for $12 million. The department alleges in the suit that a reasonable value for the company as of November 2002 was far less than the amounts paid for the company stock and the total deferred compensation agreements entered into with Webb. The defendants allegedly violated ERISA by rejecting their fiduciary duties of loyalty and prudence to the plan, engaging in self-dealing, permitting or engaging in prohibited transactions, and failing to monitor the performance of the plan's appraiser. In addition to seeking the recovery of all losses to the ESOP resulting from the above violations, the Labor Department's suit seeks the disgorgement of unjust profits from Webb that he received from the two deferred compensation agreements and from his sale of EVI stock to the ESOP. Employers and workers can reach EBSA's San Francisco office at 415-625-2481 or toll-free at 866-444-3272 for help with problems relating to private sector retirement and health plans.

"April 24, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20120424,"US Labor Department files complaint to recover more than $63,000 in retirement funds, health care premiums for employees of JJD Industries in Schiller Park, Ill.","CHICAGO – The U.S. Department of Labor has filed a complaint in federal court seeking to restore a total of $63,582.14 in health care premiums and retirement plan contributions withheld from the paychecks of employees at several companies that are part of the JJD Industries group in Schiller Park, Ill. The lawsuit, which is based on the findings of an investigation by the department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration, alleges that John Dombek III – president, fiduciary and part owner of JJD Industries – improperly managed the benefit plans’ assets in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Additionally, John Dombek Jr., a co-fiduciary of the Wisconsin Tool & Stamping Co. 401(k) plan, is alleged to have improperly managed assets of that plan by failing to monitor the remittance of employee contributions. “Failing to properly administer health insurance premiums demonstrates a total lack of concern for employees and their families,” said Steve Haugen, director of EBSA’s Chicago Regional Office. “Incorporating employees’ voluntary salary contributions into the general assets of a company and failing to forward them to the retirement plan are violations of both the law and the trust workers have placed in their employers. The Labor Department is committed to taking action that leads to workers obtaining their rightful benefits.” JJD Industries sponsored a group health plan with Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois to provide health and dental benefits to the employees of its related companies, including Wisconsin Tool & Stamping Co., J.D. Acquisition Corp., Akorat Metal Fabricators Inc./Smithco Fabricators Inc. and Pavo Inc./Injection Plastics Corp. The companies paid their premiums separately, and premiums were partially funded through weekly employee payroll deductions. The suit alleges that employee contributions for premiums totaling $41,475.59 were withheld but not remitted to the health care provider, and instead were retained in the general funds of the individual companies. The amounts withheld include: $15,867.85 from the period of May 6-Aug. 20, 2010, by Akorat Metal Fabricators/Smithco Fabricators; $5,084.64 from April 5-Aug. 20, 2010, by J.D. Acquisition; and $20,381.13 from May 3-Aug. 20, 2010, by Wisconsin Tool & Stamping. On June 1, 2010, Blue Cross cancelled the health insurance policy for these companies for failure to pay premiums. Additionally, Pavo/Injection Plastics withheld $141.97 from employees’ pay from Sept. 3-17, 2010, that was not forwarded to Blue Cross, resulting in the provider cancelling that policy on Oct. 1, 2010. The suit further alleges that from Jan. 1, 2008, through Sept. 17, 2010, Wisconsin Tool & Stamping withheld $20,176.57 in contributions from employees’ paychecks and never remitted them to the company’s 401(k) profit-sharing plan, but instead commingled the funds with its general assets. Additionally, during the same time period, the company withheld an additional $6,610.09 from employees’ paychecks and failed to timely remit that amount to the plan. Additionally, Midland Chutes, doing businesses as J.D. Acquisition, withheld $1,929.98 in contributions from employees’ paychecks from Jan. 1, 2008, through March 23, 2011, that never was remitted to the company’s 401(k) plan but retained in the company’s general funds. The complaint seeks the restoration of all losses for which the defendants are liable, including appropriate interest. It also seeks an order to require the defendants to correct the prohibited transactions and disgorge any profits received as a result of their actions. Additionally, it seeks to permanently enjoin Dombek Jr. and Dombek III from serving as fiduciaries or service providers to any employee benefit plan subject to ERISA. Finally, it seeks the appointment of an independent fiduciary to oversee the termination of the 401(k) plans of both Wisconsin Tool & Stamping and J.D. Acquisition, as well as the distribution of plan assets to eligible participants. Dombek Jr. and Dombek III have both filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection. The secretary of labor has filed a separate complaint to determine dischargeability of debt and seek the enforcement of any monetary judgment against both individuals to restore the funds to the employee benefit programs. The case is being litigated by the Labor Department’s Regional Office of the Solicitor in Chicago.

"April 19, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20120419-1,US Department of Labor announces opportunity for states to develop innovative demonstrations of re-employment strategies,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor today announced guidance for state demonstration projects to identify innovative strategies that quickly connect unemployed workers with good jobs. Today's announcement is a key component of the first major overhaul of the Unemployment Insurance system in decades, made possible by the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 signed by President Obama in February. From extending unemployment benefits that help families weather the recession to creating new skills training programs for those seeking jobs, the administration is committed to rebuilding an economy which ensures that Americans who work hard and play by the rules have the ability to realize economic security and the American dream. Last fall, the president called on Congress to act immediately to continue tax relief for virtually every working American; to reform the Unemployment Insurance system to better connect Americans with work, while also extending benefits for those who continue to pound the pavement looking for work; and to enact policies that will lay the foundation for future growth. These reforms to the Unemployment Insurance program aim to help American workers and our economy by reducing layoffs, fostering entrepreneurship and reducing the time it takes for unemployed workers to get back into jobs. As a result of these reforms, up to 10 states will be able to use administrative funding – or apply for a waiver to use Unemployment Insurance Trust Funds – to implement and evaluate programs that expedite the ability of people to return to work. ""This administration is committed to finding new and innovative ways to turn the unemployment system into a re-employment system, and state programs can play a crucial role in doing so,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""These projects will help improve services, lower costs and provide crucial worker protection measures to ensure that employers who follow the rules are able to compete on a level playing field."" Approved states will conduct projects that demonstrate and evaluate measures to expedite the re-employment of individuals who are eligible to receive unemployment compensation, or projects that improve the effectiveness of a state in carrying out its state law with respect to re-employment. Projects can provide wage subsidies for employer-provided training, or direct disbursements not to exceed the weekly benefit amount of an individual, to employers who hire those receiving unemployment compensation. The demonstration projects will be selected on a rolling basis. The guidance released today provides details on the application process, activities that may be pursued, the requirements for obtaining a waiver of the withdrawal standard or methods of administration requirements in existing law, and the requirements for evaluation of the demonstration projects.

"April 18, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20120418,US Department of Labor releases proposed tribal consultation policy,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor today published in the Federal Register a proposed tribal consultation policy, creating a formal process through which the department will engage in consultation with federally recognized tribes on actions or policies that will have a significant impact on tribal nations. This policy would apply to any department action that affects federally recognized Indian tribes and requires that the department's government-to-government consultation involve both appropriate tribal and department officials. ""The development of the Labor Department's tribal consultation policy honors the relationship between the Native American community and the U.S. government, thanks to the president's leadership calling for ongoing engagement with tribal nations and communities,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""This policy aims to strengthen the U.S. government's interactions with sovereign tribal nations. We look forward to receiving feedback and implementing the policy."" On Nov. 9, 2009, President Obama cited Executive Order 13175, which was issued by President Clinton, tasking executive branch departments and agencies with engaging tribal nations to formalize federal programs that impact tribal communities. Following the president's charge, the Department of Labor began devising a plan. A series of consultative listening sessions, including meetings with representatives of the Native American community, the department's Native American Employment and Training Council, and the National Congress of American Indians, preceded the finalization of the tribal consultation policy proposed today. A public comment period will end June 18. Following the comment period, the department will evaluate comments for prospective changes to the proposed policy.

"April 17, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20120417,Statement by Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis on Equal Pay Day,"WASHINGTON – Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis today issued the following statement regarding Equal Pay Day: ""It has been nearly half a century since the Equal Pay Act was signed to abolish wage discrimination on the basis of sex. In that time, women from all walks of life have demonstrated extraordinary leadership, patriotism, scientific and artistic vision, and great personal sacrifice – both at home and in the workplace. Still, women continue to earn less than men. As a nation, we continue to work toward the fundamental promise of equal pay for equal work. ""Today, on Equal Pay Day, we reflect on the challenges that millions of women – particularly those of color, single mothers and women with disabilities – continue to face in securing the pay they deserve. ""Women now make up nearly half of the nation's workforce, and 60 percent of all women work full time. In almost two-thirds of families led by single mothers or two parents, mothers are either the primary or co-breadwinner. Pay equity is not simply a question of fairness; it is an economic imperative with serious implications not just for women, but for their families, their communities and our nation. Moreover, when women start at a disadvantage, they stay there. ""Next year will mark the 100th anniversary of the Department of Labor. We will recognize the achievements of our past and look to a future committed to increasing incomes and education, eliminating wage and income inequality, and putting more women on a path into the middle class. ""Closing the pay gap requires closing the information gap. For more than 90 years, our Women's Bureau has been instrumental in this important effort for women, most recently by hosting a series of dialogues across the country to make sure women are educated about their worth and empowered to advocate for it. We're also working with researchers, experts and the brightest minds in the field of Web technology to create new tools that will make useful information about wages readily accessible to workers. ""Additionally, for more than 45 years now, our Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs has been building a strong record of identifying and eliminating gender-based discrimination for federal contractors. Last year, this office successfully resolved 134 cases of employment discrimination affecting women and minorities, resulting in more than $12 million in remedies for victims of discrimination. ""I am proud of the steps we've taken to close the pay gap. But I recognize that we still have so much work to do. This Equal Pay Day, while progress has been made, let us all renew our commitment to advancing the progress of working women and their families. Let us continue to pursue pay equity with both passion and determination."" Visit the DOL Equal Pay website"

"April 16, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20120416,Delta Air Lines signs agreement with US Department of Labors OSHA on seat belt compliance measures to protect airline industry workers,"WASHINGTON – Delta Air Lines Inc. has signed a corporatewide settlement agreement with the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration in order to protect workers who operate baggage handling vehicles. The agreement covers approximately 90 of the Atlanta-based company's airport sites that fall under federal OSHA's jurisdiction, as well as 16,000 Delta employees and 6,000 baggage handling vehicles. Under the agreement, Delta will come into compliance with applicable requirements for the use of seat belts by ensuring that all types of the company's baggage handling vehicles are equipped with them and that employees use the seat belts while operating the vehicles on specified airport routes. ""OSHA's corporatewide settlement agreements are highly effective tools for ensuring that companies address hazards that can injure or kill their workers,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health Dr. David Michaels. ""This kind of widespread change within corporations can go a long way toward keeping workers across the country safe and healthy at the end of every workday."" The agreement is the result of a citation issued to Delta following a workplace fatality in which an employee operating a baggage tug vehicle without wearing a seat belt was ejected from the vehicle and died. OSHA cited Delta for violating 29 Code of Federal Regulations 1910.132, which requires employers to provide employees with personal protective equipment, including – in this case – seat belts. According to the agreement, Delta has committed to an abatement schedule that will result in full compliance within two years. During the first year, Delta will train its employees on the proper use of seat belts and install seat belts on those pieces of equipment that currently lack them. During the second year of the agreement, the company will fully enforce seat belt use among its employees, as well as hire safety consultants to monitor the company's implementation of its seat belt use program and report the results to OSHA. In addition to entering into the agreement with Delta, OSHA will address this hazard throughout the airline industry. The agency recently sent a hazard alert letter to airlines across the nation reminding them that they are obligated to comply with applicable seat belt use requirements. The settlement agreement can be viewed at http://www.osha.gov/csa/delta041612.html . Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. OSHA's role is to ensure these conditions for America's working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education and assistance.

"April 16, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20120416,"Memphis, Tenn.-based Morgan Keegan agrees to pay more than $630,000 to benefit plans after US Department of Labor finds pension rule violations","MEMPHIS, Tenn. – Morgan Keegan and Co. Inc. has agreed to pay $633,715.46 to 10 pension plans covered by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. This agreement follows an investigation by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Employee Benefits Security Administration that found the full-service brokerage company violated federal law when it recommended certain hedge funds of funds as investments to its ERISA-covered employee benefit plan clients. These recommendations resulted in the hedge funds of funds paying Morgan Keegan revenue-sharing and other fees. Under the terms of the settlement, Morgan Keegan has agreed to disclose to its ERISA plans clients whether the company will act as a fiduciary to those plans. If the company is acting as a fiduciary, it will specify the services that it is providing as a fiduciary. Morgan Keegan also will provide to its ERISA plans clients a description of all compensation and fees received, in any form, from any source, involving any investment or transaction related to them. The company either will not collect commissions or, if it does collect them, refund to its ERISA plans clients 100 percent of the amount collected from third parties. “The law is very clear: If you accept a fee to give investment advice to a retirement plan, you are a fiduciary and must therefore act solely in the best interests of the participants in that plan,” said Phyllis C.

"April 14, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20120414,"US Labor Department seeks to recover more than $256,000 in retirement assets for workers at Heartland Foods in Indianapolis","INDIANAPOLIS – The U.S. Department of Labor has filed a complaint in federal court seeking to restore $256,457.08, plus lost opportunity costs, to the Heartland Foods Inc. 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan. Based on the findings of an investigation by the department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration, the complaint alleges that co-owners Karen S. Curry and Danny Woods failed to properly manage the assets of the plan by comingling employee contributions with the company’s general operating accounts, in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. “Incorporating employees’ voluntary salary contributions into the general assets of a company and failing to forward them to their retirement plan is a violation of the law and the trust workers have placed in their employers,” said L. Joe Rivers, director of EBSA’s Cincinnati Regional Office, which conducted the investigation. “The Labor Department is committed to helping workers obtain their rightful benefits so that they can continue to provide for themselves and their families during retirement.” The department alleges that from Jan. 1, 2008, through Dec. 31, 2010, Curry and Woods, with knowledge of each other’s actions, withheld $85,232.08 in contributions and loan repayments to the plan from workers’ paychecks and commingled those funds with the general assets of the company. The funds were never remitted to the plan. Additionally, from July 15 through Dec. 12, 2008, Curry and Woods allegedly transferred or caused to be transferred $171,225 in plan assets into a checking account in the company’s name. Those funds were never remitted to the plan. Finally, in January 2011, Curry and Woods distributed Woods’ own plan account to him and distributed another individual account to a participant, exceeding the allowable distribution limit by $21,610.71. As of April 30, 2011, the plan had 35 participants and $228,393.72 in assets, the latest data available. The complaint seeks the restoration of all plan losses for which the defendants are liable, with appropriate interest. It also seeks to order Curry and Woods to correct the prohibited transactions and to permanently enjoin both from serving as fiduciaries or service providers to any employee benefit plan subject to ERISA. Additionally, both Curry and Woods would be required to disgorge any profits received as a result of the prohibited transactions. An independent fiduciary would be appointed to administer the plan. The case is being litigated by the Labor Department’s associate regional solicitor in Cleveland.

"April 12, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20120412,"Bartlett Grain in Atchison, Kan., cited for willful and serious violations by US Labor Department after 6 die, 2 injured in grain elevator explosion","ATCHISON, Kan. – Bartlett Grain Co. L.P. faces five willful and eight serious safety violations cited by the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration following an October 2011 grain elevator explosion in Atchison that killed six workers and left two others hospitalized. The willful violations include allowing grain dust – which is nine times as explosive as coal dust – to accumulate, using compressed air to remove dust without first shutting down ignition sources, jogging (repeatedly starting and stopping) inside bucket elevators to free legs choked by grain, using electrical equipment inappropriate for the working environment and failing to require employees to use fall protection when working from heights. ""The deaths of these six workers could have been prevented had the grain elevator's operators addressed hazards that are well known in this industry,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""Bartlett Grain's disregard for the law led to a catastrophic accident and heartbreaking tragedy for the workers who were injured or killed, their families and the agricultural community."" The serious violations involve a lack of proper preventive maintenance, certification and lubrication of grain handling equipment; inadequate emergency action plan training for employees and contractors; a lack of employee and contractor training on job hazards; and a housekeeping program that was deficient because it did not prevent grain dust accumulations. The citations to Bartlett Grain, which is based in Kansas City, Mo., carry $406,000 in proposed fines. Topeka-based Kansas Grain Inspection Services Inc., a contractor employed by Bartlett Grain, also is being cited for one willful violation involving a lack of fall protection for employees working on the top of rail cars; one serious violation, the lack of a hazard communication program; and one other-than-serious violation, not providing basic advisory information about respirators to employees. These violations carry total proposed penalties of $67,500. ""OSHA standards save lives, but only if companies comply with them,"" said Dr. David Michaels, assistant secretary of labor for occupational safety and health. ""Bartlett Grain has shown what happens when basic safety standards are ignored, and this agency simply will not tolerate needless loss of life."" A willful violation is one committed with intentional knowing or voluntary disregard for the law's requirements, or with plain indifference to worker safety and health. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known. An other-than-serious violation is one that has a direct relationship to job safety and health, but probably would not cause death or serious physical harm. Over the past 35 years, there have been more than 500 explosions in grain handling facilities across the United States that have killed more than 180 people and injured more than 675. Grain dust is the main source of fuel for explosions in grain handling. This dust is highly combustible and can burn or explode if enough becomes airborne or accumulates on a surface and finds an ignition source (such as a hot bearing, overheated motor or misaligned conveyor belt, as well as heat or sparks from welding, cutting and brazing operations). OSHA standards require that both grain dust and ignition sources be controlled in grain elevators to prevent potentially deadly explosions. For more information on grain handling, visit http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/grainhandling/ . The citations to Bartlett Grain Co. L.P. and Kansas Grain Inspection Services Inc. can be viewed at http://www.osha.gov/ooc/citations/Bartlett_issued_04122012.pdf and http://www.osha.gov/ooc/citations/KGIS_issued_04122012.pdf , respectively. Both companies have 15 business days from receipt of the citations and penalties to comply, request an informal conference with OSHA's area director in Wichita, or contest the findings before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. To ask questions, obtain compliance assistance, file a complaint, or report workplace hospitalizations, fatalities or situations posing imminent danger to workers, the public should call OSHA's toll-free hotline at 800-321-OSHA (6742) or the agency's Wichita Area Office at 316-269-6644. Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. OSHA's role is to ensure these conditions for America's working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education and assistance.

"April 12, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20120412,US Department of Labor extends comment period on proposed rule to implement statutory amendments to Family and Medical Leave Act,"Interested parties may submit comments through April 30 WASHINGTON  The U.S. Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division has extended the comment period for its proposed rule to implement new statutory amendments to the Family and Medical Leave Act that would expand military family leave provisions and incorporate a special eligibility provision for airline flight crew employees. On Feb. 15, the department published a notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register with a public comment period scheduled to end on April 16. Although many comments already have been submitted on the proposal, the department has received requests from various organizations to extend the comment period. Because of the interest that has been expressed and the department's desire to obtain as much information about its proposal as possible, the comment period has been extended through April 30. To view the proposed rule and submit comments, visit the federal e-rulemaking portal at http://www.regulations.gov and search by regulation identification number 1235-AA03. The FMLA, enacted in 1993, entitles eligible employees of covered employers to take unpaid, job-protected leave for specified family and medical reasons. The proposed language would extend the entitlement of military caregiver leave to family members of veterans for up to five years after leaving the military. At this time, the law only covers family members of ""currently serving"" service members. Additionally, the proposal expands the military family leave provisions of the FMLA by extending qualifying exigency leave to employees whose family members serve in the regular armed forces. Currently, the law only covers families of National Guard members and reservists. For airline flight crew employees, the proposed revision makes the benefits of the FMLA more accessible. It would add a special hours of service eligibility requirement for them and specific provisions for calculating the amount of FMLA leave used that better take into account the unique — and often difficult to track — hours worked by crew members.

"April 10, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20120410,US Department of Labor invites news organizations to request credentials to participate in press lock-ups providing pre-release access to economic data,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor invites news organizations interested in participating in its press lock-ups to request credentials, which will be valid beginning on Friday, July 6, with the release of The Employment Situation report. The lock-ups facilitate the media's ability to provide the public with informed summaries and analysis of critical economic data concurrent with their release by providing pre-release access to the data reports. News organizations that currently participate in Labor Department lock-ups and those that do not will be considered a single pool of candidates and follow the same request process. The Office of Management and Budget's Statistical Policy Directive No. 3 governs access to pre-release statistical data (50 Federal Register 38932 Sept. 25, 1985). The department is adopting additional guidance contained in OMB's Statistical Policy Directive No. 4 (73 Federal Register 12622 March 7, 2008). In accordance with OMB's directives, the Labor Department is responsible for establishing procedures and security arrangements to ensure that there is no premature release of information or data estimates from its lock-ups. The department will credential news organizations that, by providing informed summaries and data analysis, best advance the purpose of pre-release access as defined by Statistical Directives Nos. 3 and 4. The lock-up facility is small, and the department anticipates that there will be space for a total of only 20-30 journalists. Accordingly, depending on the number of requests received, the department might not be able to grant credentials in response to all of the requests (and might not issue more than one credential to any single news organization). Given the limited number of work stations/seats and the department's goal in advancing the purpose of pre-release access, the department will credential news organizations that are primarily journalistic enterprises and prepare – and publish, broadcast and/or post on the Internet – time-sensitive summaries and analysis of department data, which are likely to contribute significantly to public understanding through the dissemination of original news, analysis and/or opinion. In addition, the department believes that the purpose of pre-release access would be best served if the department's credentialing decisions result in a group of credentialed news organizations which, when considered as an overall group (and not necessarily on an individual basis), distribute a variety of types of news/media products that reach a wide and diverse audience, including geographically, and general public versus specialized media. The department will not consider editorial or political viewpoints in making credentialing decisions. The Policy Statement and News Organization Agreement accompanying this alert identifies the policy and procedures that the Labor Department will use to determine which news organizations are authorized to participate in its lock-ups and the requirements applied to those selected to participate. It also provides the agreement form that news organizations and their participating representatives must sign to receive credentials from the department. Any news organization interested in credentials may submit a request signed by its Washington bureau chief, with a phone number and email address, via electronic mail to Kaplan.Jennifer@dol.gov until April 24, 2012. Information provided to the department on how the news organization's participation will advance the purposes identified in the Policy Statement and News Organization Agreement will be very important in the department's consideration of the credentialing request. All requests for credentials from news organizations will be acknowledged with a reply email. News organizations may be requested to supply additional information. The department will advise news organizations of their status via email by – May 8, 2012. Between May 8 and July 6, representatives of all credentialed news organizations will be invited to a mandatory orientation at the Labor Department's Frances Perkins Building, which will include hands-on demonstration and testing. On April 16 at 2 p.m. Eastern Time, a conference call will be held to address questions about the credentialing process, along with other policy changes to the lock-ups that are reflected in the Policy Statement and News Organization Agreement. Anyone interested is welcome to participate. Obtain call-in information by contacting Jennifer Kaplan at 202-693-5052 or Kaplan.Jennifer@dol.gov . The call will be recorded, and the audio file subsequently will be made available in the Newsroom of the Labor Department's website at http://www.dol.gov/dol/media/ .

""For 25 consecutive months, we've registered private sector job growth. Some months we are seeing tremendous job gains, while other months we are seeing more modest gains. But the trend line is clear: Our economy is growing, and our recovery is durable. ""Since this president took office, we've added more than 4 million jobs to an economy that was bleeding 800,000 a month under the last administration. That's a noteworthy achievement. ""We've added nearly half a million manufacturing jobs since February 2010. This week, major U.S. carmakers announced that their U.S. sales rose last month to the highest level in at least four years. When President Obama took office, the U.S. auto industry was on the verge of collapse. Since he bet big on the American autoworker, the industry has seen a complete turnaround, adding more than 230,000 jobs since the summer of 2009. ""However, the fact that some Americans are still leaving the labor force shows that we cannot rest on our laurels and expect to coast our way back to prosperity. This administration continues to fight for programs that will support and train our youth and displaced workers. Our recovery will only be as lasting as our commitment to the American worker. Now that the country is on a steady path toward recovery, we need to invest in community colleges and job training programs that prepare our workers for 21st century jobs."""

The two-week classroom instruction at the National Mine Health and Safety Academy in Beaver, W.Va., covers topics such as using proper interview techniques to conduct thorough investigations, the use of injunctive relief in federal district courts, evaluating evidence, reviewing knowing and willful violations, and processing discrimination complaints. In order that MSHA investigators understand how to appropriately control accident sites, agents from the FBI's Evidence Response Unit are instructing them on how to approach an accident scene, photograph the scene, obtain and secure evidence, deal with false or altered records, and release the scene. Attorneys with the department's Office of the Solicitor are presenting on civil and criminal aspects of investigations, specifically addressing evidence needed for successful prosecutions. Representatives from the U.S. Department of Justice are assisting MSHA presenters with lectures on subjects including how to prepare cases for the U.S. Attorney's Office, evaluate cases for criminal referral, serve as expert advisers and witnesses, and understand the responsibilities of a grand jury. ""MSHA's special investigations division is an integral part of the agency's overall enforcement program,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""This training will serve to strengthen the skills needed to conduct the most thorough, solid and accurate investigations."" The minimum requirements to become a special investigator include being an authorized representative of the secretary of labor with authority to conduct inspections or having the authorization for right of entry to mining operations, as well as the completion of five weeks of formal classroom training. Credentials also may be obtained through an on-the-job training program. Classroom work consists of reviewing and studying the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, regulations, policy and procedures, and final decisions by the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission."

""These grants offer women the opportunity to gain skills in industries that will continue to grow and offer long-term career opportunities,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""Partnerships that include Registered Apprenticeship programs, local workforce investment areas and community-based organizations create a powerful support system to recruit and train women for careers in nontraditional occupations."" The grants will support innovative projects that improve the recruitment, hiring, training, employment and retention of women in apprenticeships within industries such as advanced manufacturing, transportation and construction. Within these industries, the grants will fund activities focused on three occupational areas: existing occupations expected to experience primarily an increase in employment demand, existing occupations with significant change to the work and worker requirements, and new and emerging green occupations. Eligible applicants include consortia that comprise a community-based organization, a local workforce investment area and a Registered Apprenticeship program sponsor. Applicants must place at least 50 participants annually – and at least 100 over the life of the grant – into a Registered Apprenticeship program. The grants are jointly administered by the Labor Department's Women's Bureau and its Employment and Training Administration's Office of Apprenticeship.

"April 5, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20120405,US Labor Departments OSHA announces new National Emphasis Program for Nursing and Residential Care Facilities,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration today announced a new National Emphasis Program for Nursing and Residential Care Facilities to protect workers from serious safety and health hazards that are common in medical industries. OSHA develops national emphasis programs to focus outreach efforts and inspections on specific hazards in an industry for a three-year period. Through this NEP, OSHA will target nursing homes and residential care facilities in an effort to reduce occupational illnesses and injuries. In 2010, according to the department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, nursing and residential care facilities experienced one of the highest rates of lost workdays due to injuries and illnesses of all major American industries. The incidence rate for cases involving days away from work in the nursing and residential care sector was 2.3 times higher than that of all private industry as a whole, despite the availability of feasible controls to address hazards. The data further indicate that an overwhelming proportion of the injuries within this sector were attributed to overexertion as well as to slips, trips and falls. Taken together, these two categories accounted for 62.5 percent of cases involving days away from work within this industry in 2010. For this NEP, OSHA will target facilities with a days-away-from-work rate of 10 or higher per 100 full-time workers. ""These are people who have dedicated their lives to caring for our loved ones when they are not well. It is not acceptable that they continue to get hurt at such high rates,"" said Dr. David Michaels, assistant secretary of labor for occupational safety and health. ""Our new emphasis program for inspecting these facilities will strengthen protections for society's caretakers."" Health care workers face numerous serious safety and health hazards, and the NEP will provide guidance to OSHA compliance staff on the policies and procedures for targeting and conducting inspections specifically focused on the hazards associated with nursing and residential care. These hazards include exposure to blood and other potentially infectious material; exposure to other communicable diseases such as tuberculosis; ergonomic stressors related to lifting patients; workplace violence; and slips, trips and falls. Workers also may be exposed to hazardous chemicals and drugs. The NEP directive can be viewed at http://www.osha.gov/OshDoc/Directive_pdf/CPL_03-00-016.pdf . Information for employers and employees in nursing homes and residential care facilities, including guidance on ergonomics and workplace violence, is available at http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/nursinghome/ . Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. OSHA's role is to ensure these conditions for America's working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education and assistance.

Gonzalez have been ordered to restore $519,601 to the company’s 401(k) profit-sharing plan, according to the terms of a judgment and order entered in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California. The judgment and order resolve a lawsuit that was filed by the U.S. Department of Labor based on an investigation by its Employee Benefits Security Administration. The suit alleged that the defendants failed to pay required fringe benefits to the plan and breached their fiduciary duties under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act by not administering the plan solely in the best interests of participants. At the time of the violations, Gonzalez was the owner and president of the company. Chief Judge Anthony W. Ishii found that the now-defunct construction company was required to pay its workers an hourly prevailing wage rate, including a fringe benefit for each participant in the form of contributions to the retirement plan, when it was contracted to perform work on projects financed by government agencies. The company was paid in full by the agencies for its work, including fringe benefit amounts, and certified that it was sending the fringe benefits to the plan. However, the company failed to remit more than $300,000 to the plan, choosing instead to use the money for general operating expenses. In addition to that amount, the judge’s order requires the company to restore lost earnings to the plan. “Retirement savings are a vital part of ensuring a steady income after we leave the workforce, which is a key reason that Congress chose to give them special protections,” said Phyllis C. Borzi, assistant secretary of labor for employee benefits security. “Unfortunately, the individuals entrusted with protecting this plan violated those safeguards.” This case is part of EBSA’s national enforcement initiative to safeguard workers’ pension and health benefit plans. The Labor Department’s regional solicitor in San Francisco litigated the case. Employers and workers can reach EBSA’s San Francisco Regional Office at 415-625-2481 or toll-free at 866-444-3272 for help with problems relating to private sector retirement and health plans.

"April 3, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20120403,MSHA: MSHA publishes final rule on examinations in underground coal mines,"Rule will lead to enhanced protection of miners health and safety ARLINGTON, Va. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration today announced that the final rule ""Examinations of Work Areas in Underground Coal Mines for Violations of Mandatory Health or Safety Standards"" will be published in the April 6 issue of the Federal Register. The rule will enhance miners' health and safety by requiring mine operators to identify and correct hazardous conditions and violations of nine health and safety standards that pose the greatest risk to miners, including the kinds of conditions that led to the explosion at the Upper Big Branch Mine. ""Many of the same types of violations of mandatory health and safety standards are repeatedly found by MSHA inspectors in underground coal mines every year,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""It is critically important for mine operators to take ownership of health and safety. By expanding the existing requirement that operators identify and correct hazardous conditions to include violations of these nine standards, a number of fatalities and injuries may be prevented."" The nine standards address ventilation, methane, roof control, combustible materials, rock dust, equipment guarding and other safeguards. They are consistent with the standards emphasized in MSHA's ""Rules to Live By"" initiative and the types of violations cited in MSHA's accident investigation report on the Upper Big Branch Mine explosion as contributing to the cause of that deadly accident. The rule requires that, during pre-shift, supplemental, on-shift and weekly examinations, underground coal mine operators must, in addition to examining for hazardous conditions as in the existing regulations, record the actions taken to correct the conditions and violations. Operators also must review with mine examiners, on a quarterly basis, citations and orders issued in areas where pre-shift, supplemental, on-shift and weekly examinations are required. The rule was proposed in December 2010, and five public hearings were held in June and July 2011. Mine operators are currently required by law to conduct these examinations; the final rule will ensure that such examinations are maximally effective in preventing injuries and fatalities by requiring operators to examine and fix violations of those standards that represent the greatest risk to underground coal miners. ""As we've said so many times before, MSHA cannot be at every mine every day,"" Main added. ""This rule places mine operators in a proactive – rather than reactive – role by requiring them to conduct examinations to identify a potentially hazardous condition before it results in a danger to miners."" In 2010, MSHA cited approximately 173,000 violations, of which approximately 80,000 were attributable to underground coal mines, even though these mines represent just 4 percent of all mines. MSHA launched Rules to Live By, an outreach and enforcement program designed to strengthen efforts to prevent mining fatalities, in February 2010. The first phase was focused on spotlighting the safety and health standards most frequently cited during fatal accident investigations. Rules to Live By II, which began in November 2010, reviewed accidents that resulted in five or more fatalities, as well as incidents caused by fires or explosions that had the potential to result in more fatalities. Rules to Live By III, initiated this past January, focuses on 14 safety standards associated with violations contributing to at least five mining accidents and at least five deaths during a recent 10-year period."

"April 2, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/owcp/owcp20120402,US Labor Department announces proposed rules implementing amendments to Black Lung Benefits Act from the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Labor's Office of Workers' Compensation Programs has issued a proposed rule implementing amendments to the Black Lung Benefits Act that were enacted in Section 1556 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. The PPACA reinstates two provisions regarding coal miners' and survivors' entitlement to benefits that had been eliminated by 1981 amendments to the BLBA. The PPACA reinstated 30 United States Code 921(c)(4), which provides a presumption of total disability or death caused by pneumoconiosis for coal miners who worked for at least 15 years in underground (or comparable surface) mining and who suffer or suffered from a totally disabling respiratory impairment. The second amendment is 30 U.S.C. 932(l), which provides automatic entitlement for eligible survivors of miners who were themselves entitled to receive benefits as the result of a lifetime claim. The proposed rule also includes several changes to obsolete or unnecessary regulations, in accordance with Executive Order 13563. The proposed rule addresses both new methods of establishing entitlement — the automatic entitlement of certain survivors and the 15-year presumption as it applies to both miners' and their survivors' claims. The proposed rule will apply to claims filed on or after the March 23, 2010, enactment of the PPACA and to all claims filed after Jan. 1, 2005, that were pending on or after the enactment date. ""The Affordable Care Act's amendments to the BLBA provide critical benefits to miners who have had their livelihood taken away by this insidious disease,"" said OWCP acting Director Gary A. Steinberg. ""The late Sen. Robert Byrd championed these vital provisions, and our proposed rules implementing them would have a dramatic impact on families who have proudly spent their lives working in the mining industry."" From 1982 until the PPACA was enacted, survivors of a coal miner who was totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis had to prove that pneumoconiosis had caused the miner's death to be entitled to benefits. In 2011, the 3rd and 4th U.S. Circuit Courts of Appeals upheld the PPACA amendment that automatically continues benefits to a miner's eligible survivors if the miner was entitled to benefits on a claim filed prior to death. The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals also has upheld the reinstated 15-year presumption. The proposed rule was published in the March 30 issue of the Federal Register and can be viewed at http://s.dol.gov/P8. Interested parties may submit comments online at http://www.regulations.gov or through the other methods listed in the Federal Register until May 29. The Office of Workers' Compensation Programs administers several disability benefits programs that cover federal workers, nuclear weapons workers, coal miners, longshore and harbor workers, and civilian contractors of the federal government who work overseas. These programs provide a variety of medical benefits, as well as wage replacement, vocational rehabilitation and other services. Benefits also may be paid to eligible dependents or survivors.

"March 29, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20120329,US Labor Department initiative finds more than $1.3 million in back wages due to 478 underpaid Massachusetts employees,"Ongoing labor law enforcement efforts aim to remedy violations in restaurant industry BOSTON — An ongoing enforcement initiative conducted by the U.S. Department of Labor focused on the restaurant industry in Massachusetts has uncovered significant violations of the minimum wage, overtime and record-keeping provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act. To date, investigations by the Boston District Office of the department's Wage and Hour Division have found $1,307,808 in back wages due to 478 employees of multiple establishments. In addition, the division now is assessing liquidated damages, payable to employees, when employers are found in violation. ""The restaurant industry employs some of our country's lowest paid workers, who are vulnerable to exploitation,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""In response to the extensive level of noncompliance we discovered, we will expand our efforts to bring the industry into compliance to ensure that employees receive the minimum wage and overtime wages required by law."" ""Our investigations found that several restaurants violated the FLSA by paying employees flat salaries for all hours worked without overtime pay, failing to combine hours worked at multiple locations for overtime purposes, paying incorrect overtime rates to tipped employees, making illegal deductions from employees' wages and failing to keep accurate records of employees' hours,"" said George A. Rioux, the division's district director in Boston. ""Even more serious, our investigations found an emerging trend of misclassifying restaurant workers as independent contractors in order to avoid minimum wage, overtime and record-keeping requirements of the FLSA."" Among the establishments found to have underpaid their workers are 15 Not Your Average Joe's restaurants in Greater Boston and eastern Massachusetts; six Science Partners restaurants in Cambridge and Boston, including Miracle of Science, Middlesex Lounge and Tory Row; Metropolitan Club restaurants in Chestnut Hill, Dedham and Natick; Noon Hill Grill in Medfield; T.G.I. Friday's in Framingham; Fresh City restaurants in Burlington, Needham Heights, Newton Upper Falls and Woburn; and Paul W. Marks in Everett. Previously announced cases involved D'Ann's Restaurant Inc., doing business as D'Ann's in Abington; 1760 Society Inc., doing business as The Sherborn Inn and The Sherborn Out in Sherborn; and Buchhalter Ltd., doing business as The Upper Crust Pizzeria in Salem. All the establishments have pledged full compliance with the FLSA and have paid or are in the process of paying their employees. Over the past year, the division also has assessed a total of $295,108 in liquidated damages against Massachusetts restaurants. When warranted, the division will assess civil money penalties against employers, payable to the government, in addition to requiring back wages and liquidated damages. Additionally, the department's Regional Office of the Solicitor, which provides legal enforcement support to the Wage and Hour Division and other departmental agencies, has obtained an order of contempt — affirmed by the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals — against Operations Management Group, which provided labor for The Sherborn Inn, D'Ann's and Paul W. Marks. OMG is being fined $1,000 each day that it fails to cooperate and provide requested records to the Labor Department. Employees jointly employed by the establishments and OMG were misclassified as independent contractors and consequently not paid required overtime for hours worked beyond 40 in a week. The division plans to coordinate with state agencies responsible for enforcing state laws that address such violations and may refer these types of cases to the Internal Revenue Service when appropriate. The division also plans to continue outreach and educational efforts with the Massachusetts Restaurant Association to help the organization's members comply with the law. The FLSA requires that covered employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour as well as time and one-half their regular rates for every hour they work beyond 40 per week. The law also requires employers to maintain accurate records of employees' wages, hours and other conditions of employment, and prohibits employers from retaliating against employees who exercise their rights under the law. The FLSA provides that employers who violate the law are, as a general rule, liable to employees for back wages and an equal amount in liquidated damages. The department has a smartphone application to help employees independently track the hours they work and determine the wages they are owed. Available in English and Spanish, users conveniently can track regular work hours, break time and any overtime hours for one or more employers. This new technology is significant because, instead of relying on their employers' records, workers now can keep their own records. This and other Labor Department apps are available at http://www.dol.gov/dol/apps . For more information about the requirements of the FLSA, contact the Wage and Hour Division's Boston office at 617-624-6700 or the division's toll-free helpline at 866-4US-WAGE (487-9243).

"March 28, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20120328,MSHA: Advance notification of federal mine inspectors still a serious problem,"ARLINGTON, Va. – Despite stepped-up enforcement efforts over the past two years by the U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration, some mine operators continue to tip off their employees when federal inspectors arrive to carry out an inspection. The Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 specifically prohibits providing advance notice of inspections conducted by MSHA. There have been several recent instances in which MSHA has been able to detect the occurrence of advance notice. For example, on March 22, agency inspectors responded to a hazard complaint call about conditions at Gateway Eagle Coal Co. LLC's Sugar Maple Mine in Boone County, W.Va. A truck driver with J&N Trucking reportedly alerted mine personnel by citizens band radio of the inspectors' arrival. The inspection turned up 14 violations for advance notification, accumulations of combustible material, and inadequate preshift and on-shift examinations, as well as a failure to comply with the current ventilation plan, maintain the lifeline, maintain permissibility of mobile equipment and maintain fire fighting equipment. As a second example, during a Feb. 29 inspection at Rhino Eastern LLC's Eagle No. 2 Mine in Wyoming County, W.Va., a dispatcher's decision to shut down the belts prompted a call from the section foreman about his actions. The dispatcher responded that an MSHA inspector was at the mine. During this inspection, three citations were issued for failure to comply with the roof control and ventilation plans. In addition, a citation was issued to Applachian Security, a contractor, for providing advance notification of the MSHA inspection. Rhino Eastern's Eagle No. 1 Mine was placed on potential pattern of violations status in November 2010 and again in August 2011 after a miner was killed in a rib collapse, and the mine's compliance record deteriorated. A third example is from Feb. 13, when the dispatcher for Metinvest B V's Affinity Mine in Raleigh County, W.Va., notified the belt foreman over the mine telephone that federal and state inspectors were headed underground. The mine operator was issued a citation and, to abate it, MSHA required that all certified foremen and dispatchers be trained in the requirements of the Mine Act regarding advance notification, and that a notice be conspicuously posted in the mine office to ensure future compliance with the Mine Act. ""Providing advance notice of an inspection is illegal,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""It can obscure actual mining conditions by giving mine employees the opportunity to alter working conditions, thereby inhibiting the effectiveness of MSHA inspections. Furthermore, it appears that current penalties are not sufficient to deter this type of conduct."" Upper Big Branch Mine superintendent Gary May recently entered into a plea agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice, admitting to conspiracy to give advance notification of mine inspections, falsify examination of record books and alter the mine's ventilation system before federal inspectors were able to inspect underground. May testified that, through these unlawful practices, the mine operator was able to avoid detection of violations by federal and state inspectors. ""Despite the attention to the issue that has resulted from the Upper Big Branch investigation and recent testimony from Gary May, advance notice continues to occur too often in the coalfields,"" said Main. ""Upper Big Branch is a tragic reminder that operators and miners alike need to understand advance notice can prevent inspectors from finding hazards that can claim miners' lives."""

Utilities Inc., for failing to forward employee contributions and loan repayments to the company’s 401(k) plan in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. “Plan officials have a duty to manage and protect employees’ benefits and assets,” said Roger Hilburn, director of the Dallas Regional Office of the Labor Department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration. “The action taken in this case will restore plan assets that were not properly preserved for the company’s workers.” The department’s suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, was based on an EBSA investigation that found Hobbs had failed to timely and completely remit employee contributions and loan payments to the plan from Jan. 4, 2008, through Feb. 15, 2011. The suit sought a court order to have Hobbs restore plan losses and interest totaling $24,380 as well as an injunction prohibiting him from ERISA violations. The consent judgment and order obtained by the department permanently bar Hobbs from serving as a fiduciary to any plan governed by ERISA in the future, and also require him to restore all plan losses and pay a penalty for the violations. L.A. Utilities, which operated out of Stafford until it closed in February 2011, laid utilities lines for new construction.

"March 23, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20120323,US Labor Department commemorates anniversary of Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire,"WASHINGTON – In commemoration of the 101st anniversary of the deadly fire at the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory in New York City, the U.S. Department of Labor is encouraging the public to visit a special website featuring an audio tour optimized for smartphones documenting that milestone in labor's history. With audio narrated by Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis and other senior Labor Department officials, the website highlights 21 locations throughout the New York City metropolitan area that played a role in the March 25, 1911, fire. Users can read and hear about the events that led up to the fire, its victims and the aftermath. The fire killed 146 workers and was an early tipping point in the struggle to ensure basic health and safety precautions in the 20th century workplace. ""The tragic events of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire and their impact over the last 100 years are reminders of the importance of the work of the Labor Department,"" said Secretary Solis. ""As we continue to ensure that every company takes responsibility for the safety and health of its workers, we must also remember that although much has improved over the last 100 years, the heartbreaking images from the fire are still relevant today.""

"March 23, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20120323,US Department of Labor awards grant to provide employment services for Pennsylvania oil refinery workers affected by layoffs,"WASHINGTON – A $5 million National Emergency Grant has been awarded by the U.S. Department of Labor to the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry to provide re-employment services to about 1,000 workers affected by the closure of two oil refineries in the commonwealth. The refineries provided jobs at ConocoPhillips' Trainer facility and Sunoco Inc.'s Marcus Hook facility as well as for contractors who were employed at both locations. ""Anytime major employers shut their doors, communities suffer,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""This federal grant aims to help lessen the negative impact of these closures by providing re-employment and retraining services so impacted workers can more effectively compete for new jobs in growing industries."" In 2011, the companies announced that the refineries would be closed if buyers could not be found. The department's grant will provide dislocated workers with intensive employment-related services, including occupational skills training, in order to help them re-enter the workforce in growing sectors of the local economy. National Emergency Grants are part of the secretary of labor's discretionary fund and are awarded based on a state or commonwealth's ability to meet specific guidelines.

"March 22, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20120322,MSHA announces results of February impact inspections,"5 coal mines selected based on frequent hazard complaints ARLINGTON, Va. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration today announced that federal inspectors issued 253 citations and orders during special impact inspections conducted at 15 coal mines and two metal/nonmetal mines last month. The coal mines were issued 235 citations and eight orders, while the metal/nonmetal operations were issued 23 citations and six orders. Five of the coal mines were selected in part because of frequent hazard complaints. Investigations of 20 anonymous complaints between March 1, 2011, and March 1, 2012, at these five mines resulted in citations being issued when allegations in 12 of the complaints proved true. These inspections, which began in force in April 2010 following the explosion at the Upper Big Branch Mine, involve mines that merit increased agency attention and enforcement due to their poor compliance history or particular compliance concerns, including high numbers of violations or closure orders; frequent hazard complaints or hotline calls; plan compliance issues; inadequate workplace examinations; a high number of accidents, injuries or illnesses; fatalities; and adverse conditions such as increased methane liberation, faulty roof conditions and inadequate ventilation. As an example from last month, MSHA conducted an impact inspection on Feb. 28 at Glen Alum Operations LLC's Upper Cedar Grove No. 4 Mine near Wharncliffe, W.Va., in response to an anonymous complaint submitted the previous day. The complaint alleged that 11 unsafe conditions relating to electrical, roof control and combustible material hazards existed underground. Inspectors issued 23 citations and three orders, 14 of which were designated significant and substantial. The first violation cited by inspectors occurred when an employee called underground to provide advance notification of the inspectors' presence. The gravity of this violation was magnified by the number of violations and hazardous conditions encountered in the mine, so the initial citation was subsequently modified. One closure order was issued for inadequate permissibility examinations on electrical equipment, and two unwarrantable failure orders were issued for inadequate preshift inspections of the section and belt conveyor entries. MSHA also found and cited conditions such as inadequate or missing firefighting equipment, improper maintenance of dust suppression sprays on the continuous mining machine, accumulations of combustible material, electrical violations, equipment that was in an unsafe operating condition and missing lifeline reflectors. ""Due to the recent rash of fatalities at coal surface facilities, the majority of last month's impact inspections focused on surface operations,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""I am disturbed about the continuation of advance notice of mine inspections,"" he added. ""It appears that current penalties are not sufficient to deter this type of conduct."" As a second example from last month, an impact inspection was conducted during the day shift on Feb. 9 at Clintwood Elkhorn Mining Inc.'s Laurel Branch Surface Mine in Hurley, Va. The inspection team issued 32 citations, 22 of which were designated as significant and substantial. Upon arriving at the mine, MSHA inspectors reviewed its examination records and inspected highwalls, explosive magazines and 33 pieces of equipment. They issued 11 citations for accumulations of combustible materials – including oil, hydraulic fluids and/or coal dust – on the engine compartments of front end loaders, excavators, dozers and trucks. Laurel Branch also failed to maintain effective drill dust control on three drills used in the coal seam pit. The inspector observed large plumes of dust emitting from the doors on the dust box, between the drill steel and chip deflector, and from the flap of the broken drill skirt. These conditions exposed the powder crew, located 40 feet away, to high silica rock dust as well as the risk of developing silicosis and other respiratory impairments. The operator was cited four times for not properly maintaining dry chemical fire suppression systems and fire extinguishers in a usable and operative condition on dozers. Laurel Branch relied upon its contractor, Logan Corp., to properly check these fire suppression systems. As a result, MSHA cited the contractor twice for failure to examine and maintain firefighting equipment. These conditions, in combination with heat generated by engine, transmission, battery and fuel pump components, exposed mobile equipment operators to fire and smoke inhalation hazards. Since April 2010, MSHA has conducted 420 impact inspections, which have resulted in a total of 7,420 citations, 732 orders and 26 safeguards.

"March 22, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20120322,US Labor Department announces availability of $12 million in grants to provide employment services for formerly incarcerated females,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor today announced the availability of approximately $12 million in grants to provide workforce development and support services for formerly incarcerated adult and youth females as they make the transition from justice facilities back to their communities. ""Communities benefit when formerly incarcerated individuals are able to smoothly and effectively reintegrate into their neighborhoods,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""The programs funded through today's grant announcement will make this transition easier, resulting in more stable families and brighter futures."" Grantees must provide participants with services including job training that will lead to credentials in high-demand industries; employment preparation; mentoring and assistance in connecting to supportive services such as housing, and treatment for substance abuse and mental health issues; and assistance with parenting and child reunification. While designed to expand opportunities for formerly incarcerated females, services funded by the grants also must be open to eligible formerly incarcerated males. Reintegrating formerly incarcerated individuals is a government-wide effort supported by the Federal Interagency Re-entry Council. Chaired by the U.S. Department of Justice, the council brings together numerous federal agencies to advance policies and programs to make communities safer, assist individuals returning to communities from prison or jail in becoming productive taxpaying citizens, and save taxpayer dollars by lowering the direct and collateral costs of incarceration. ""The Re-entry Council is making important progress in ensuring public safety and advancing community well-being,"" said Attorney General Eric Holder. ""We applaud this Department of Labor investment in women who have been formerly incarcerated and are working to rebuild their lives. This is an opportunity to make a difference – not only for these women, but also for their families, neighborhoods and communities."" Each grant applicant may submit one proposal for up to $1.5 million, with the amount requested depending on the number of participants to be served. This competition is open to any nonprofit organization with Internal Revenue Service 501(c)(3) status, unit of state or local government and Indian or Native American entity eligible for grants under Section 166 of the Workforce Investment Act. Full eligibility information is included in the solicitation for grant applications, which will be published in the March 23 edition of the Federal Register and also can be viewed online at http://www.doleta.gov/grants/find_grants.cfm .

"March 22, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ofccp/ofccp20120322,Shipping giant FedEx to pay $3 million to settle charges of hiring discrimination brought by US Department of Labor,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs today announced that it has entered into a conciliation agreement to resolve allegations of hiring discrimination by federal contractors FedEx Ground Package System Inc. and FedEx SmartPost Inc., both subsidiaries of Memphis, Tenn.-based FedEx Corp. The agreement concludes compliance reviews that spanned seven years and numerous FedEx facilities in multiple states, and includes the largest single financial settlement negotiated by OFCCP since 2004. ""We are committed to building an economy that lasts — one in which every qualified worker gets a fair shot to compete for jobs, and every employer plays by the same set of rules,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""This settlement is proof that we will aggressively protect workers, promote workplace diversity and enforce the laws governing federal contractors."" During a series of regularly scheduled reviews, OFCCP compliance officers found evidence that FedEx's hiring processes and selection procedures violated Executive Order 11246 by discriminating on the bases of sex, race and/or national origin against specific groups identified at 23 facilities in 15 states. The affected workers include men and women as well as African-American, Caucasian and Native American job seekers, as well as job seekers of Hispanic and Asian descent. The reviews also uncovered extensive violations of the executive order's record-keeping requirements. Under the terms of the conciliation agreement, the companies will pay a total of $3 million in back wages and interest to 21,635 applicants who were rejected for entry-level package handler and parcel assistant positions at 22 FedEx Ground facilities and one FedEx SmartPost facility. FedEx also has agreed to extend job offers to 1,703 of the affected workers as positions become available. The 21,635 rejected job seekers represent one of the largest classes of victims of any case in OFCCP's history. ""Being a federal contractor is a privilege and means you absolutely, positively cannot discriminate, not when you are profiting from taxpayer dollars,"" said OFCCP Director Patricia A. Shiu. ""Under this agreement, FedEx will have to really examine and revamp its hiring practices across the entire company. The American people ought to have confidence that one of our nation's most trusted brands will not tolerate discrimination."" In addition to the financial remedies and job offers, FedEx Ground has committed to wide-ranging reforms. The company has promised to correct any discriminatory hiring practices, develop and implement equal employment opportunity training, and launch extensive self-monitoring measures to ensure that all hiring practices fully comply with the law. FedEx Ground also has agreed to engage an outside consultant to perform an extensive review of the company's hiring practices and provide recommendations to change and improve those practices, to train incumbent and future supervisors and employees, and to monitor compliance with the equal employment opportunity laws enforced by OFCCP. Finally, the company will take necessary steps to comply with all record-keeping requirements. FedEx Ground is based in Coraopolis, Pa. The 22 FedEx Ground facilities where OFCCP found violations are located in Sun Valley and Sacramento, Calif.; Tampa, Fla.; Ellenwood, Ga.; Carol Stream and Chicago, Ill.; Indianapolis and Jeffersonville, Ind.; Lenexa, Kan.; Livonia, Mich.; St. Paul, Minn.; South Hackensack, N.J.; Albany and Brooklyn, N.Y.; Greenville, N.C.; Addyston and Grove City, Ohio; Lewisberry, Pa.; Fort Worth, Houston and South Houston, Texas; and North Salt Lake City, Utah. OFCCP also conducted compliance evaluations at two FedEx Ground facilities in Phoenix, Ariz., and San Antonio, Texas, but found no violations. FedEx SmartPost is based in New Berlin, Wis. The FedEx SmartPost facility where OFCCP found violations is located in Charlotte, N.C. In addition to Executive Order 11246, OFCCP enforces Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974. As amended, these three laws require those who do business with the federal government, both contractors and subcontractors, to follow the fair and reasonable standard that they not discriminate in employment on the basis of sex, race, color, religion, national origin, disability or status as a protected veteran.

"March 20, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20120320,US Department of Labors OSHA revises Hazard Communication Standard,"Regulation protects workers from dangerous chemicals,helps American businesses compete worldwide WASHINGTON – To better protect workers from hazardous chemicals, the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration has revised its Hazard Communication Standard, aligning it with the United Nations' global chemical labeling system. The new standard, once implemented, will prevent an estimated 43 deaths and result in an estimated $475.2 million in enhanced productivity for U.S. businesses each year. ""Exposure to hazardous chemicals is one of the most serious dangers facing American workers today,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""Revising OSHA's Hazard Communication Standard will improve the quality, consistency and clarity of hazard information that workers receive, making it safer for workers to do their jobs and easier for employers to stay competitive in the global marketplace."" The Hazard Communication Standard, being revised to align with the United Nations' Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals, will be fully implemented in 2016 and benefit workers by reducing confusion about chemical hazards in the workplace, facilitating safety training and improving understanding of hazards, especially for low literacy workers. OSHA's standard will classify chemicals according to their health and physical hazards, and establish consistent labels and safety data sheets for all chemicals made in the United States and imported from abroad. The revised standard also is expected to prevent an estimated 585 injuries and illnesses annually. It will reduce trade barriers and result in estimated annualized benefits in productivity improvements for American businesses that regularly handle, store and use hazardous chemicals, as well as cost savings of $32.2 million for American businesses that periodically update safety data sheets and labels for chemicals covered under the standard. ""OSHA's 1983 Hazard Communication Standard gave workers the right to know. As one participant expressed during our rulemaking process, this update will give them the right to understand, as well,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health Dr. David Michaels. During the transition period to the effective completion dates noted in the standard, chemical manufacturers, importers, distributors and employers may comply with either 29 Code of Federal Regulations 1910.1200 (the final standard), the current standard or both. The final rule revising the standard is available at http://s.dol.gov/P1. Further information for workers, employers and downstream users of hazardous chemicals can be reviewed at OSHA's Hazard Communication Safety and Health topics at http://www.osha.gov/dsg/hazcom/ , which includes links to OSHA's revised Hazard Communication Standard and guidance materials such as Q and A's, OSHA fact sheet and Quick Cards. Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees.

"March 20, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ilab/ilab20120320,US Department of Labor presents Iqbal Masih award to American documentary filmmaker for efforts to combat exploitative child labor,"WASHINGTON — Documentary filmmaker Len Morris received the 2011 Iqbal Masih Award for the Elimination of Child Labor during a ceremony today at U.S. Department of Labor headquarters. Deputy Undersecretary of Labor for International Affairs Sandra Polaski presented the award, which honors Morris for producing and editing groundbreaking documentaries that highlight the plight of child laborers around the world. ""This award recognizes the life's work of Len Morris in raising public awareness about the plight of working children around the globe,"" said Polaski. ""His films and advocacy highlight child labor, hunger in Africa and homeless child laborers."" Congress established the Iqbal Masih Award for the Elimination of Child Labor in 2009 to recognize exceptional efforts by an individual, company, organization or national government to end the worst forms of child labor. The award reflects the spirit of Iqbal Masih, a Pakistani child sold into bonded labor as a carpet weaver at age 4. He escaped his servitude and became an outspoken advocate of children's rights, drawing international attention in his fight against child labor. Masih was killed in Pakistan at age 13 in 1995. In 2011, the Labor Department's Bureau of International Labor Affairs published a notice in the Federal Register soliciting public nominations for the annual award. Morris was nominated for raising international awareness of child labor and inspiring others to join the fight to improve the lives of working children. His 2008 documentary ""Rescuing Emmanuel"" highlights the struggles of millions of street children around the world by telling the story of a 13-year-old Kenyan boy. His 2003 documentary ""Stolen Childhoods"" was filmed in seven countries and exposes the shocking plight of child laborers. The words and images of these children and their advocates illustrate the breadth of the problem, its root causes and possible solutions.

The judgment resolves a lawsuit filed by the Labor Department in May 2011 alleging that Thermacon Industries violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The suit charged that, after the company ceased operations in 2004, its fiduciaries failed to terminate the retirement plan and distribute its assets, which are valued at $242,159. Under the judgment, entered in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, Metro Benefits Inc. of Pittsburgh was appointed as the independent fiduciary with authority to manage the plan, distribute assets to plan participants and beneficiaries, and terminate the plan. “This employer did not honor its legal obligation to terminate and distribute the assets of its employee retirement plan when the company went out of business,” said Norman Jackson, acting regional director of the Labor Department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration in Philadelphia. “This action will ensure that the plan is properly managed, and participants and beneficiaries will gain access to hard-earned retirement assets.” The suit resulted from an investigation by EBSA’s Philadelphia Regional Office.

The purpose of these grants is to improve the long-term labor market prospects for former offenders, ages 14 and older, in high-poverty, high-crime areas by focusing on training for in-demand industries and occupations within their communities. Any nonprofit organization with 501(c)(3) status and the capacity to implement multisite, multistate projects may apply for these grants.

""The programs to be funded by these grants will give young people who have gotten off-track the tools, support and opportunities to positively contribute to their communities."" Awarded through a competitive process, the grants will be used to fund programs that incorporate components such as workforce development, education and training, case management, mentoring, restorative justice and community-wide violence reduction. Additionally, grant recipients are expected to develop community connections that result in opportunities for young former offenders to rebuild trust and become known as valuable contributors to their communities. The Labor Department anticipates awarding four grants of about $5 million each. Each grantee will be required to competitively select local subgrantees to operate the funded program in a minimum of three high-poverty, high-crime communities in at least two states.

""All workers deserve a fair shot to compete for and secure good jobs, and it is incumbent upon companies that do business with taxpayer dollars to make sure that the doors of opportunity are truly open to everyone,"" said OFCCP Director Patricia A. Shiu, a member of the federal Interagency Working Group on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. ""President Obama has articulated his commitment to protecting the civil rights of our nation's rapidly growing Asian American communities, and I'm pleased that we were able to work out a settlement which will provide financial relief and jobs for workers who were denied their fair shot."" During a scheduled compliance review, OFCCP determined that NCS Pearson violated Executive Order 11246 in 2009 by using a hiring process that resulted in systemic discrimination against Asian job applicants at its Iowa City facility. Under the terms of a conciliation agreement signed by NCS Pearson and OFCCP, the contractor will pay $100,000 in back wages and interest to the 67 affected job seekers, and will offer associate software developer positions and retroactive seniority to at least four class members as positions become available. Additionally, the company will revise its selection policies and procedures to ensure equal employment opportunities for future applicants. NCS Pearson, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the British company Pearson PLC, holds more than $12 million in federal contracts to conduct research and development for the U.S. Department of Education. The company provides educational materials, electronic learning programs and test development, processing and scoring services to educational institutions and corporations around the world. In addition to Executive Order 11246, OFCCP enforces Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974. As amended, these three laws require those who do business with the federal government, both contractors and subcontractors, to follow the fair and reasonable standard that they not discriminate in employment on the basis of sex, race, color, religion, national origin, disability or status as a protected veteran.

The Fraud Tips and Leads Gateway, a new online tool, provides the public with a portal to report fraud. It will help states act quickly to aggressively investigate tips and leads as well as prosecute bad actors. In addition, the Labor Department is publishing new, consumer-friendly materials highlighting the most common mistakes that claimants make and what businesses can do to avoid the negative tax implications of improper payments.

""Reducing improper Unemployment Insurance payments is crucial to maintaining the integrity of this vital lifeline for millions of American families, and we each have a role to play,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L.

Over the next several weeks, the department also will reach out through a number of social media outlets to provide UI claimants with ""quick tips"" to learn more about their local One-Stop Career Centers, connect with state job banks and avoid mistakes that can lead to improper payments. The resources announced today are part of an ongoing effort to help states reduce their improper payment rates. In September, the department created a new landing page that allows visitors to identify improper payment rates for each state and provides tips to help reduce these payments.

Based on the findings of an investigation by the department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration, the complaint alleges that co-owners Karen S. Curry and Danny Woods failed to properly manage the assets of the plan by comingling employee contributions with the company’s general operating accounts, in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. “Incorporating employees’ voluntary salary contributions into the general assets of a company and failing to forward them to their retirement plan is a violation of the law and the trust workers have placed in their employers,” said L. Joe Rivers, director of EBSA’s Cincinnati Regional Office, which conducted the investigation. “The Labor Department is committed to helping workers obtain their rightful benefits so that they can continue to provide for themselves and their families during retirement.” The department alleges that from Jan. 1, 2008, through Dec. 31, 2010, Curry and Woods, with knowledge of each other’s actions, withheld $85,232.08 in contributions and loan repayments to the plan from workers’ paychecks and commingled those funds with the general assets of the company. The funds were never remitted to the plan. Additionally, from July 15 through Dec. 12, 2008, Curry and Woods allegedly transferred or caused to be transferred $171,225 in plan assets into a checking account in the company’s name. Those funds were never remitted to the plan. Finally, in January 2011, Curry and Woods distributed Woods’ own plan account to him and distributed another individual account to a participant, exceeding the allowable distribution limit by $21,610.71. As of April 30, 2011, the plan had 35 participants and $228,393.72 in assets, the latest data available. The complaint seeks the restoration of all plan losses for which the defendants are liable, with appropriate interest. It also seeks to order Curry and Woods to correct the prohibited transactions and to permanently enjoin both from serving as fiduciaries or service providers to any employee benefit plan subject to ERISA. Additionally, both Curry and Woods would be required to disgorge any profits received as a result of the prohibited transactions. An independent fiduciary would be appointed to administer the plan.

The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, resulted from an investigation by the New York Regional Office of the department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration. The suit alleges that the defendants violated their fiduciary duties as trustees by engaging in a series of prohibited financial transactions between 2006 and the present. These include the improper transfer of more than $2.9 million in assets from Local 829’s pension plan to the union and its annuity, vacation and hiring hall funds, as well as the improper transfer of at least $240,000 from the pension plan and annuity fund to service providers. Additionally, the defendants allegedly allowed the annuity fund to retain at least $5.9 million in undocumented and inadequately secured loans to fund participants, including Local 829 President John V. McNamee Jr., and they failed to prudently investigate or evaluate the annuity fund’s investment of more than $5 million into an illiquid real estate investment trust. “These trustees have violated their basic responsibility to administer the plans prudently and solely in the interests of the plans’ participants, and no one else,” said Jonathan Kay, EBSA’s New York regional director. “We seek to impose upon these defendants the additional responsibilities of accounting for and correcting their violations, and providing the necessary information and assistance to ensure that the plans are properly managed in the future.” The suit asks the court to order the defendants to correct the prohibited transactions and restore to the plan all losses attributable to their breaches, plus interest, as well as to remove the defendants as fiduciaries to the plans and permanently enjoin them from ever again serving as fiduciaries or service providers to any ERISA-covered plan. The suit also seeks the appointment of an independent fiduciary with plenary fiduciary authority and control over the plans, and requires the defendants to provide an equitable accounting of the whereabouts and status of the plans’ assets, liabilities, investment gains and losses, income earned and payments received by the plans since March 1, 2006.

Silicon Plains Technologies was located in Urbandale and provided system design, consultation and custom computer programming services. McCormick served as the company’s CEO from 1993 to 2009. An investigation by the department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration found that the funds, withheld from the employees’ paychecks between January 2007 and December 2008, were commingled with the general assets of the company and used for company purposes and obligations. These funds were supposed to be used for the exclusive benefit of the plan and its participants. McCormick admitted to owing funds to the plan in a consent judgment filed in his personal bankruptcy case. “Plan fiduciaries must act solely in the interests of participants who are counting on these funds for retirement. These defendants failed in their obligations to their employees, and the Labor Department is committed to seeing that plan participants are protected,” said James Purcell, director of EBSA’s Kansas City Regional Office in Missouri, which conducted the investigation. The department filed the lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, Jacksonville Division, because McCormick resides in or near St. Augustine, Fla. The department is asking the court to order that the defendants restore to the plan all losses including interest and lost opportunity costs, set off McCormick’s own individual plan accounts against the amount of losses and enjoin the defendants from any further violations of ERISA. The department also has asked that the defendants be permanently barred from serving as fiduciaries for any plan that is subject to ERISA, and that an independent fiduciary be appointed at the defendants’ expense to oversee the plan and distribute the proceeds to the plan or the participants, as appropriate.

"March 9, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20120309,Statement by Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis on February employment numbers,"WASHINGTON Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis issued the following statement on the February 2012 Employment Situation report released today: ""Our nation's labor market continued to register solid growth in the month of February. The economy added 233,000 private sector jobs last month, while the unemployment rate held steady at a three-year low of 8.3 percent. ""We've had 24 straight months of private sector job growth, adding more than 3.9 million jobs to an economy that was bleeding almost 800,000 jobs in a single month when President Obama took office. U.S. job growth over the last six months has been the strongest since before the recession began in 2006. ""U.S. labor force participation is on the rise. The American people are more confident that they can find work because they see a strengthening economy. The consumer confidence index is at its highest level in a year, and many employers are responding by adding to their payrolls. ""February's accelerated job growth was widespread across a range of industries, including 82,000 new jobs in professional and business services, 61,000 in health care and social assistance, 44,000 in leisure and hospitality, and 31,000 in manufacturing. The continued growth in the manufacturing sector is encouraging. This industry, which lost more than 2 million jobs through the recession, has added back 429,000 positions in the last two years. ""Now that more jobs are being created, we need to help American workers obtain new skills to be successful in today's rapidly changing labor market. We can make great strides here if we act on President Obama's proposal to forge new partnerships between community colleges and businesses so employers in high-growth industries can put Americans in jobs requiring specific technical skills. ""One area of continued concern is construction, which lost 13,000 jobs in February. The president has put forward a specific plan to develop the nation's infrastructure, which will have an immediate effect on this industry and the workers who depend on it. We need to build and modernize roads, rails, runways and schools, which would create thousands of good jobs in short order. Infrastructure investments are sorely needed across the country, and our unemployed construction workers deserve a bipartisan deal and the jobs it would bring. ""Last month, Congress extended unemployment benefits and payroll tax relief, proving that it is possible for lawmakers to work together without the drama we saw last year around the debt ceiling debate. Uncertainty from the political environment has derailed our recovery before. By coming together on the challenges before us, we can continue to quicken the pace of our recovery and put more Americans back to work."""

The division published a notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register on Dec. 27, 2011, with a comment period originally set to end on Feb. 27, 2012. The division then extended the comment period to March 12. The department now will extend the comment period through March 21. Comments received between Dec. 27 and March 21 will be included in the rulemaking record. These actions will provide additional time for members of the public to analyze the issues raised in the proposal and to provide comments. The proposed rule would expand minimum wage and overtime protections by ensuring that all home care workers employed by third parties, such as staffing agencies, receive these protections. It also would clarify that individuals performing skilled in-home care work are entitled to minimum wage and overtime pay. However, individuals engaged by families for true companionship or fellowship activities, such as visiting with friends or pursuing hobbies, still would be considered ""companions"" and not be required to meet the act's labor standards provisions. To learn more about the proposed rule, visit http://www.dol.gov/whd/flsa/companionNPRM.htm .

"March 6, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20120306,MSHA internal review team releases report on agency's actions prior to UBB blast,"ARLINGTON, Va. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration today released the results of its internal review of the agency's actions prior to the April 5, 2010, explosion that killed 29 miners at the Upper Big Branch Mine in Raleigh County, W.Va. The internal review team, comprised of MSHA employees outside the district where the accident occurred, was charged with evaluating agency actions relative to the explosion and making recommendations to improve the agency's performance in order to better protect the nation's miners. The team not only focused on MSHA enforcement and plan approval activities during the 18 months preceding the explosion, it looked much deeper. Where appropriate, it also evaluated the effectiveness of MSHA standards, regulations, policies and procedures in addressing the hazards that caused or contributed to the disaster. ""I directed my staff to conduct the most comprehensive internal review that has ever been done at MSHA, and I feel confident they have achieved that objective,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""Their final report is the culmination of nearly two years of a singularly focused effort, including interviews with nearly 90 current and former MSHA employees, and the examination of more than 12,500 pages of documents."" According to the accident investigation team's findings, which were released last December, Massey Energy, then-owner of UBB, violated widely recognized safety standards and failed to prevent or correct numerous hazards that ultimately caused the catastrophic explosion by using advance notice of inspections and intimidation of miners to hide violations from federal inspectors. Three independent reports corroborated MSHA's conclusions. ""While there was no evidence linking the actions of MSHA employees to this tragedy, we found instances where enforcement efforts at UBB were compromised because MSHA and District 4 did not follow established agency policies and procedures,"" said internal review team leader George Fesak. The internal review team identified a number of shortcomings in the inspection and plan approval processes: Due to inspectors' lack of MSHA experience, insufficient training, inadequate supervisory and managerial oversight, and deficiencies in the directives system, which disseminates written policies and procedures, District 4 personnel did not comply with all policies and procedures applicable to MSHA inspections, investigations and mine plan reviews. Inspectors did not consistently identify deficiencies in the mine operator's program for cleaning up accumulations of loose coal, coal dust and float coal dust. Inspectors did not use the operator examination books records effectively when determining the operator's negligence in allowing identified hazards to continue unabated. Inspectors did not identify the extent of noncompliance with rock dust standards along belt conveyors. Inspectors did not identify significant deficiencies in the operator's ventilation and roof control plans. District 4 personnel did not intervene as Massey manipulated MSHA procedures to avoid complying with reduced standards for respirable coal mine dust and allowed the operator to significantly delay corrective action to reduce miners' exposures to unhealthy respirable dust concentrations after overexposures were identified. A number of factors led to these shortcomings, according to the internal review team: Lack of resources: Budgetary constraints prior to 2006 resulted in significant reductions in the inspection workforce and, despite district efforts to re-establish staffing levels, by the time of the explosion, the inspection and supervisory staff had not fully regained the level of experience it had lost. Inspector experience: A newly-hired trainee needs approximately two years to complete classroom and on-the-job training to become a journeyman inspector. When new inspectors were hired after 2006, there were not enough experienced inspectors to mentor them or oversee their on-the-job training. Agency experience among lead UBB inspectors during the review period ranged from 13 to 52 months. Management turnover: Between June 2003 and July 2004, four different MSHA personnel were temporarily assigned to the district manager position in District 4. Supervisory and managerial oversight: Supervisors did not adequately review UBB inspection reports, identify significant deficiencies or recognize that some portions of the mine had not been inspected. The turnover of supervisors in the Mt. Hope field office, including untrained acting supervisors, contributed to the inadequate review of inspection reports. ""MSHA is responsible for its actions and will address each of the problems the team has specifically identified,"" said Main. ""We take the deficiencies and recommendations outlined in this internal review extremely seriously. In fact, shortly after the tragedy at UBB, we began aggressively implementing a number of corrective actions, some of which directly address the internal review team's findings."" Corrective actions put in place after April 2010 include: An emergency temporary standard, which became a final rule in June 2011, that increased the minimum non-combustible (or incombustible) content of mine dust to at least 80 percent throughout a coal mine. A strengthened potential pattern of violations program to hold mine operators more accountable for safety and health conditions. Proposed rules that would revise the agency's existing regulation for pattern of violations, address the continuing risk of coal miners' exposure to respirable coal mine dust and require improved examination of work areas by underground coal mine operators. Impact inspections that target mines with a history of noncompliance. Program information bulletins on compliance with ventilation regulations, illegality of advance notification, the right of miners to make hazardous condition complaints and legal protections against discrimination. The creation of District 12 to provide additional resources in conjunction with District 4 in southern West Virginia. Mandatory and refresher training for field office supervisors and inspectors. Upgrading computer systems and equipment at the National Air and Dust Laboratory in Mt. Hope, W.Va. Creating top level oversight of special enforcement initiatives, including accountability audits, impact inspections, POV and flagrant violations, and a tool on all inspectors' laptop computers to flag potentially flagrant violations. Since the tragedy at Upper Big Branch, one former UBB security director was convicted of lying to federal investigators and ordering the destruction of evidence. Another former employee was sentenced to jail time after he was convicted of faking a mine foreman's license and lying to federal investigators. And on Feb. 22, 2012, a UBB mine superintendent was charged in a criminal information for conspiracy to defraud the United States by engaging in a conspiracy to give advance notification of mine inspections, falsify examination record books and alter the mine's ventilation system before federal inspectors were able to inspect underground."

"March 1, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20120301,US Department of Labors OSHA Whistleblower Protection Program moved to Office of the Assistant Secretary,"WASHINGTON – Moving forward with continuing efforts to strengthen employees' voices in the workplace, the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration today announced a major restructuring of its Office of the Whistleblower Protection Program. The program will now report directly to the agency's Office of the Assistant Secretary instead of to its Directorate of Enforcement Programs. This move represents a significantly elevated priority status for whistleblower enforcement, which now will be overseen directly by Assistant Secretary of Labor Dr. David Michaels, who heads OSHA. ""The ability of workers to speak out and exercise their rights without fear of retaliation provides the backbone for some of American workers' most essential legal protections. OSHA's internal improvement initiatives, including this realignment, demonstrate the agency's steadfast commitment to strengthening a program that is critically important to the protection of worker rights,"" said Michaels. OSHA first announced that it would restructure its whistleblower program on Aug. 1, 2011, as part of the agency's multifaceted plan for strengthening the enforcement of 21 whistleblower laws under its jurisdiction. Implementation of this plan began with the fiscal year 2012 budget as OSHA established a separate budgetary line item for the whistleblower program to better track and hold accountable its activities and accomplishments. In addition to the change at OSHA's national office, the agency has launched pilot projects to evaluate structural changes in 10 field regions that could further strengthen the whistleblower program. Sandra Dillon, who has served as the acting director of OWPP since May 2011, will lead the Office of the Whistleblower Program as its director. OSHA enforces the whistleblower provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 and 20 other statutes protecting employees who report alleged violations of various workplace, commercial motor vehicle, airline, nuclear, pipeline, environmental, railroad, public transportation, maritime, consumer product, health care reform, corporate securities, food safety and consumer financial reform regulations. Additional information is available at http://www.whistleblowers.gov . Under the OSH Act, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. OSHA's role is to ensure these conditions for America's working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education and assistance.

"February 29, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20120229,MSHA announces results of January impact inspections,"ARLINGTON, Va. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration today announced that federal inspectors issued 253 citations, orders and safeguards during special impact inspections conducted at 12 coal mines and four metal/nonmetal mines last month. The coal mines were issued 171 citations, 15 orders and two safeguards, while the metal/nonmetal operations were issued 64 citations and one order. These inspections, which began in force in April 2010 following the explosion at the Upper Big Branch Mine, involve mines that merit increased agency attention and enforcement due to their poor compliance history or particular compliance concerns, including high numbers of violations or closure orders; frequent hazard complaints or hotline calls; plan compliance issues; inadequate workplace examinations; a high number of accidents, injuries or illnesses; fatalities; and adverse conditions such as increased methane liberation, faulty roof conditions and inadequate ventilation. As an example from last month, on Jan. 13, an impact inspection was conducted during the second shift at Perry County Coal Corp.'s E4-1 Mine in Perry County, Ky. The inspection team, which captured and monitored the phones to prevent advance notice of its arrival, issued 35 citations and three orders. The mine's last impact inspection, conducted in May 2011, had resulted in 27 citations and one order. Following January's inspection, the mine was issued unwarrantable failure orders for noncompliance with the ventilation plan by failing to maintain a sufficient air volume at the end of the wing curtain when more than 18 inches of rock is being mined. (A wing curtain is a piece of flame-resistant brattice cloth used to direct air current to temporarily ventilate faces, seals or other areas of the mine.) This violation exposed miners to the risk of silicosis, black lung and a potential explosion. The mine operator also failed to control draw rock that extended from 32 crosscuts outby to the working face (approximately 2,080 feet), which exposed miners to the risk of being struck, injured or killed by pieces of falling roof. The mine operator further failed to maintain a scoop in permissible condition so that it was not a potential ignition source for explosive gasses as well as to conduct an adequate weekly examination of the same scoop. Inspectors also found that the primary and secondary escapeways, along with required lifelines, were improperly maintained, which could severely hamper miners' efforts to evacuate the mine in the event of an emergency. As a second example from last month, on the same day, MSHA conducted an impact inspection during the second shift at K and D Mining Inc.'s Mine No. 17 in Harlan County, Ky. The inspection team, which captured and monitored the mine phones, issued 21 citations and seven orders. The last impact inspection conducted at this mine had occurred in August 2010, resulting in 14 citations and six orders. During January's visit, inspectors observed eight conditions that were the result of unwarrantable failures by the mine operator. Six involved failure to maintain the conveyer belts in safe operating condition and accumulation of combustible materials along the belt lines. Two belt lines were found to have missing or stuck rollers, causing friction and creating the potential for an ignition. Accumulations of combustible material were found along three belt lines, which are required to be examined at each shift. Two 104(d) withdrawal orders were issued for the mine operator's failure to conduct an adequate exam of the section power center, which was found to be improperly maintained. Inspectors found evidence of severe arcing between receptacles on the power center, as well as on the male plugs of electrical equipment. The mine operator also failed to comply with the roof control plan, according to inspectors. They observed a hill seam (rock fissure) that was tied in with several stress cracks. The hill seam and stress cracks extended across the pillar line for a distance of approximately 115 feet. The mine operator had not installed additional support as required by the roof control plan. ""While the impact inspection program has resulted in improved compliance in mines across the country, the seriousness of the violations found at these two operations demonstrates why targeted enforcement continues to be necessary to protect the health and safety of miners,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. Since April 2010, MSHA has conducted 403 impact inspections, which have resulted in a total of 7,162 citations, 718 orders and 26 safeguards.

"February 29, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20120229,"US Labor Departments OSHA orders Georgia-based Interline Logistics Group to reinstate, pay more than $190,000 to terminated whistleblower in Illinois","SAUK VILLAGE , Ill. The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration has ordered Interline Logistics Group LLC to immediately reinstate a truck driver in Sauk Village, who was terminated after reporting safety concerns about the brakes on his truck and refusing to violate U.S. Department of Transportation regulations for allowable driving and rest hours. OSHA also has ordered the company to pay the driver more than $190,000 in back wages, compensatory damages, attorney's fees and punitive damages, and to refrain from retaliating against the employee for exercising rights guaranteed under the Surface Transportation Assistance Act's whistleblower provision. The driver filed a timely whistleblower complaint with OSHA, alleging termination after notifying the company about the deficient brakes. OSHA found that the company had directed the driver to a repair shop to service the brakes and upon completion of the service call, the driver was instructed to proceed to his dispatch location to pick up a return load. The driver declined to do so, stating he was over the work hours allowed according to DOT regulations. The following day, the driver was terminated for stated reasons including failing to follow dispatch instructions, according to the company. However, OSHA's investigation found reasonable cause to believe that the disciplinary charges and termination were not based on the driver breaking a company work rule but on reporting a safety issue and refusing to violate DOT regulations. ""This case sends a clear message that employers are simply not allowed to retaliate against workers for reporting work-related safety concerns or against drivers who refuse to violate DOT regulations that determine how many hours they are allowed to work and how much rest they receive,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health Dr. David Michaels. ""The safety of all workers and everyone on the road is endangered when employees are afraid to report safety concerns because of threats from their employers."" Interline Logistics Group is headquartered in Kennesaw, Ga., and operates nationwide. Either party to the case can file an appeal with the Labor Department's Office of Administrative Law Judges, but such an appeal does not stay the preliminary reinstatement order. OSHA enforces the whistleblower provision of the STAA as well as provisions of 20 other statutes protecting employees who report violations of various securities, airline, nuclear, pipeline, environmental, public transportation, workplace, consumer product, and health care and financial reform laws. Under these laws enacted by Congress, employers are prohibited from retaliating against employees who raise various protected concerns or provide protected information to the employer or to the government. Employees who believe that they have been retaliated against for engaging in protected conduct may file a complaint with the secretary of labor for an investigation by OSHA's Whistleblower Protection Program. Detailed information on employee whistleblower rights, including fact sheets with information on how to file a complaint with OSHA, is available online at http://www.whistleblowers.gov . Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. OSHA's role is to ensure these conditions for America's working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education and assistance. For more information, visit http://www.osha.gov . Editor's note: The U.S. Department of Labor does not release names of employees involved in whistleblower complaints."
"February 29, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20120229,US Department of Labor announces H-2A worker program updates,"New resources and updates part of ongoing commitment to optimizing performance and customer service WASHINGTON The U.S. Department of Labor's Employment and Training Administration today announced an annual change to allowable charges for meals and subsistence reimbursements, and a nonmaterial change to wage rate determinations for the H-2A worker program. Both notices will be published in the March 2 edition of the Federal Register and can be viewed at http://s.dol.gov/O9. The allowable meal charge is the maximum amount that employers seeking H-2A workers may assess their workers for daily meals provided by the employer. The rates are based upon annual data for the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers for food. The annual average percentage change for the CPI-U for food from 2010 to 2011 was 3.7 percent and, accordingly, the 2012 maximum amount an employer may charge a worker for meals provided has been raised to $11.13 per day. In addition, the H-2A program regulations require employer reimbursement of subsistence expenses, which include both meals and lodging that may be required during travel to and from a work site. The department's Employment and Training Administration, as part of an ongoing effort to improve program operations and customer service, has updated the H-2A Employer Handbook, FAQs, and related materials related to the H-2A worker program. The department's Wage and Hour Division similarly made clarifying changes to its H-2A program materials, including workers' rights resources, fact sheets and workplace posters. The department also announced today a nonmaterial change in the frequency of surveys conducted to establish minimum wage rates paid by employers to H-2A workers and workers in corresponding employment. The H-2A temporary worker program allows agricultural employers who anticipate a shortage of U.S. workers to bring nonimmigrant foreign workers to the U.S. to perform agricultural labor or services of a temporary or seasonal nature.

"February 23, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20120223,"US Labor Department, Louisiana Workforce Commission sign agreement to reduce misclassification of employees as independent contractors","WASHINGTON — Nancy J. Leppink, deputy administrator of the U.S. Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division, and Louisiana Workforce Commission Executive Director Curt Eysink signed a memorandum of understanding Feb. 23 regarding the improper classification of employees as independent contractors. This partnership is the 13th of its kind for the U.S. Department of Labor. ""This memorandum of understanding helps us send a message: We're standing united to end the practice of misclassifying employees,"" said Leppink. ""This is an important step toward making sure that the American dream is still available for employees and responsible employers alike."" ""Initiatives like this are critical in leveling the playing field for businesses that play by the rules,"" Eysink said. ""They're also vital for ensuring that eligible, hardworking men and women get the coverage and benefits they earn if they are injured on the job or lose their jobs through no fault of their own."" Employee misclassification is a growing problem. In 2011, the Wage and Hour Division collected more than $5 million in back wages for minimum wage and overtime violations under the Fair Labor Standards Act that resulted from employees being misclassified as independent contractors or otherwise not treated as employees. Business models that attempt to change, obscure or eliminate the employment relationship are not inherently illegal, unless they are used to evade compliance with federal labor law. The misclassification of employees as something else, such as independent contractors, presents a serious problem because these employees often are denied access to critical benefits and protections — such as family and medical leave, overtime compensation, minimum wage pay and Unemployment Insurance — to which they are entitled. In addition, misclassification can create economic pressure for law-abiding business owners, who often find it difficult to compete with those who are skirting the law.Employee misclassification also generates substantial losses for state Unemployment Insurance and workers' compensation funds. Memorandums of understanding with state government agencies arose as part of the U.S. Department of Labor's Misclassification Initiative, which was launched under the auspices of Vice President Biden's Middle Class Task Force with the goal of preventing, detecting and remedying employee misclassification. California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Utah and Washington have signed similar agreements. More information is available on the U.S. Department of Labor's misclassification Web page at http://www.dol.gov/misclassification . The mission of the U.S. Department of Labor is to foster, promote and develop the welfare of the wage earners, job seekers and retirees of the United States; improve working conditions; advance opportunities for profitable employment; and ensure work-related benefits and rights.

"February 23, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20120223-0,"US Department of Labor sues South Florida farmer and labor contractors; seeks back wages, liquidated damages, fines and permanent injunction","Labor Department alleges federal labor law violations during 2011 green bean harvest in Miami-Dade County MIAMI — The U.S. Department of Labor is suing farm labor contractors and a South Florida farmer over alleged violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act that occurred during the 2011 green beans harvest in Miami-Dade County. The department is also asking the court for a permanent injunction against Elvira Cepeda, Juan Jose Luna and Maria Sanchez to prevent future violations of the MSPA by the defendants. In a separate lawsuit, the department is asking that Fisteac Farm Labor Inc., Joseph Fisteac, Ledford Farms and Troy Ledford pay farmworkers three years of back wages and an equal amount of liquidated damages, and that the court impose a permanent injunction against future violations of the FLSA. The department is also pursuing an administrative judgment that would enforce a Wage and Hour Division civil money penalty order against Fisteac Farm Labor for MSPA violations during last year's harvest. The suits, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, Miami Division, and the additional legal action filed with the department's Office of Administrative Law Judges, occur as teams of division investigators return to the fields and packing houses in South Florida to assess compliance among facility owners, growers, farm labor contractors and all other business entities associated with these agricultural operations. During last year's Wage and Hour Division enforcement initiative in Homestead, investigators found that Elvira Cepeda, acting as a farm labor contractor, failed to have a certificate of registration authorizing such activities, failed to disclose to migrant workers in their own language the terms and conditions of employment, failed to keep accurate payroll records and provide workers with itemized written statements of such payroll information, and ignored an order issued by the secretary of labor denying Cepeda a farm labor contracting certificate. Between February 2010 and March 2011, Juan Jose Luna and Maria Sanchez allegedly violated the MSPA by allowing Elvira Cepeda to engage in farm labor contracting activities using their certificates. The department seeks a permanent injunction barring the defendants from violating any provision of the MSPA, including acting as a farm labor contractor without a farm labor contractor certificate. Division investigators found that Fisteac Farm Labor, Joseph Fisteac, Ledford Farms and Troy Ledford allegedly failed to pay employees the applicable federal minimum wage, and to keep and preserve accurate payroll records of employees working for them in violation of the FLSA. The agency also levied $14,750 in civil money penalties against Fisteac Farm Labor for MSPA violations. ""These actions put agricultural employers on notice that the Labor Department is committed to protecting the large number of low-wage and vulnerable agricultural workers who are susceptible to exploitation and unfair treatment,"" said Oliver Peebles III, southeast regional administrator of the Wage and Hour Division. ""Agricultural employers must understand that the department will vigorously enforce federal labor laws. It's important that consumers know the food reaching their tables was produced by employees paid fairly for their work. These lawsuits underscore the department's commitment to using any and all enforcement strategies at our disposal, including engaging the public, to protect the rights of these employees, and to level the playing field for employers who obey the law."" As occurred during the initiative last year, division investigators are currently conducting thorough inspections of transportation, field sanitation facilities, employment practices and pay records to ensure compliance with all applicable child labor and agricultural labor standards. In addition, the division is conducting outreach to inform domestic, seasonal and migrant workers of their rights under federal labor laws, and is meeting with community groups, state investigators, employer organizations and local officials to enlist their cooperation in influencing noncompliant employers to improve worker safety and compliance with wage laws. As migrant and seasonal farmworkers move northward for the harvest of other crops, the division will continue to encourage growers, contractors and workers to circulate information on labor laws, and workers to report abuses to investigators. The FLSA requires that covered employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour as well as time and one-half their regular rates for every hour they work beyond 40 per week. The law also requires employers to maintain accurate records of employees' wages, hours and other conditions of employment, and prohibits employers from retaliating against employees who exercise their rights under the law. Most agricultural employers, agricultural associations and farm labor contractors are subject to the MSPA, which protects migrant and seasonal agricultural workers by establishing employment standards related to wages, housing, transportation, disclosures and record keeping. The MSPA also requires farm labor contractors to register with the Labor Department, which maintains a list of individuals and corporations whose authorization to operate as farm labor contractors has been revoked. To determine whether a potential contractor has been declared ineligible, visit http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/statutes/mspa_debar.htm . Field sanitation provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Act require covered employers to provide toilets, potable drinking water, hand-washing facilities and information regarding good hygiene practices. These investigations were organized and coordinated by the Southeast Regional Office of the Wage and Hour Division in coordination with the Labor Department's Regional Office of the Solicitor in Atlanta. The division's Southeast Regional Office can be reached at 404-893-4525. Accessible and searchable information on enforcement activities by the U.S. Department of Labor is available at http://ogesdw.dol.gov/search. Publicly available enforcement data are also available through the free mobile application ""Eat Shop Sleep,"" which enables consumers, employees and other members of the public to check if a hotel, restaurant or retail location has been investigated by the Wage and Hour Division, and whether FLSA violations were found. Information on the FLSA and the MSPA is available to workers and employers by calling the division's toll-free helpline at 866-4US-WAGE (487-9243) and online at http://www.dol.gov/whd/ .

"February 23, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20120223-2,US Labor Department concludes settlement restoring $32 million to Tribune Co. employee stock ownership plan,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Labor’s Employee Benefits Security Administration has announced that the Tribune Co., GreatBanc Trust Co. and various insurance carriers have completed funding of a global settlement in the amount of $32 million to be allocated among the Tribune Employee Stock Ownership Plan’s participants, and to pay for legal and administrative expenses. The settlement is with, among others, the department and the plaintiffs in a private class action lawsuit, and resolves the department’s claims of violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. “This settlement ensures that the Tribune Employee Stock Ownership Plan’s participants and beneficiaries will be able to receive the benefits that are rightfully theirs,” said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. “I am pleased that participants’ hard earned retirement savings have been returned.” “The fulfillment of this settlement is good news for participants in the Tribune Employee Stock Ownership Plan,” said Phyllis C. Borzi, assistant secretary of labor for employee benefits security. “It is the culmination of my agency’s commitment and extreme hard work in this case to ensure that the employees’ contributions to the plan are handled with the utmost of care according to the law and according to what is right.” On Jan. 30, 2012, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois approved the global settlement agreement, which had received prior approval in October 2011 by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. In accordance with the global settlement agreement, the department has concluded its investigation of the plan. EBSA initiated an investigation of the plan to review its 2007 purchase of Tribune Co. stock for $250 million and the roles played by the plan’s fiduciaries, the company and the plan’s trustee, GreatBanc Trust Co. The department claimed that the company failed to act prudently and in participants’ best interests when it engaged in the ESOP transaction. Additionally, the department claimed that the ESOP transaction was prohibited, a claim consistent with the findings of the district court in the private plaintiffs’ action. As part of its 2007 corporate re-structuring, the Tribune Co. became a privately-held entity owned by the plan. In September 2008, a class action lawsuit was filed on behalf of the plan’s participants. While initially filed in California, the case was moved to the Northern District of Illinois in November 2008. In December 2008, the Tribune Co. and some of its subsidiaries filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The department filed claims in the company’s bankruptcy proceedings and objected to confirmation of plans to reorganize it. These matters were resolved as part of the global settlement agreement. As of Dec. 31, 2010, the Tribune ESOP had 13,020 participants. The settlement amount has been deposited into an independently managed settlement account. The Chicago Regional Office of the Employee Benefits Security Administration conducted the investigation into the Tribune ESOP. Employers and workers can contact that office at 312-353-0900 or toll-free at 866-444-3272 for assistance with problems related to private sector pension and health plans.

DeWese to restore $661,206 to the defunct West Chester company’s retirement plan. The judgment resolves a lawsuit filed by the department in August 2011 that alleged violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The suit resulted from an investigation by the department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration, which found that DeWese withdrew funds from the plan eight times from October 2006 to October 2007 and deposited them in his personal account and a Compass Capital Partners bank account. DeWese then used the plan funds to pay the company’s operating expenses and also transferred a portion of them to Tampa, Fla.-based Hillsboro Printing, a company in which DeWese was a shareholder. Compass Capital Partners ceased operations, and the plan was unable to pay benefits to retired participants as a result of DeWese’s actions. “These actions show a flagrant breach of fiduciary responsibility,” said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Employee Benefits Security Phyllis C. Borzi. “We will continue to hold plan sponsors and other responsible parties accountable when they fall short of their legal obligation to protect the hard-earned savings of plan participants.” Filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, the judgment removes DeWese and Compass as plan fiduciaries and permanently enjoins them from serving as fiduciaries for any ERISA-covered plan. It also appoints Metro Benefits Inc. of Pittsburgh as the independent fiduciary authorized to terminate the plan. EBSA’s Philadelphia office conducted the investigation. Employers and workers can contact that office at 215-861-5300 or toll-free at 866-444-3272 for assistance with problems related to private sector pension and health plans.

EBSA protects the security of the retirement, health and other workplace-related benefits of America’s workers, retirees and their families. The agency oversees approximately 708,000 private sector retirement plans, 2.8 million health plans and other plans that provide benefits to more than 150 million Americans. Collectively, these plans hold more than $6 trillion in assets. Additional information can be found at www.dol.gov/ebsa . Solis v. Harris M. DeWese et al.

Solis today announced during a conference call with reporters more than $183 million in grants to 43 public-private partnerships serving 28 states through the second round of funding under the H-1B Technical Skills Training Grant Competition. The grants will provide education, training and job placement assistance related to high-growth fields in which employers are currently using the H-1B nonimmigrant visa program to hire foreign workers. ""The federal grant awards announced today will provide U.S. workers with the training they need to succeed in the high tech, high-growth jobs of the future,"" said Secretary Solis. ""Developing a strong and vibrant workforce that fits the needs of American businesses is critical to forming an America built to last."" Last October, the Labor Department awarded more than $159 million to 36 grantees in the first round of the competition. Between the two rounds of grants, more than $163 million has been designated to provide on-the-job training, allowing participants to learn new skills while earning a regular paycheck. More than $200 million has been designated for grantees that serve participants who have been identified as long-term unemployed. The grants also represent significant investments in fields such as information technology, advanced manufacturing and health care. These grants are funded through fees paid by employers to bring foreign workers into the United States under the H-1B program. They are intended to raise the technical skill levels of American workers and, over time, help businesses reduce their need to use the H-1B program. The original solicitation for grant applications announced funding of $240 million to be awarded through two rounds of funding. Because additional H-1B visa fees have been collected, about $100 million more than anticipated has been awarded.

"February 21, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20120221,US Labor Department extends comment period on proposed rule to provide minimum wage and overtime protections for in-home care workers,"Interested parties may submit comments through March 12 WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division has announced a 14-day extension of the comment period for its proposed rule to provide minimum wage and overtime protections for nearly 2 million workers who provide in-home care services. Currently, workers classified as ""companions"" are exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act's minimum wage and overtime pay requirements. When established in 1974, such exemptions were meant to apply to casual babysitters and companions for the elderly and infirm — not workers who chose in-home care service as a vocation and were responsible for supporting their families. The proposal would, if enacted, grant the exemption to households where the services are provided but not third-party staffing agencies. It would further clarify that companionship services are those directly related to the fellowship and protection of a care recipient. The division published a notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register on Dec. 27, 2011, with a comment period originally set to end on Feb. 27, 2012. On Dec. 15, the proposed rule was announced by President Obama and posted on the division's website, giving the public more time than the standard 60-day period to comment on the proposal. After reviewing requests for an extension from members of Congress and the public, the division decided to extend the comment period by 14 days to Monday, March 12. This action will provide additional time for individuals to analyze the issues raised in the proposal and to provide comments. Individuals and organizations that have already submitted comments may use the extension period to revise or add to their original comments. The Labor Department first announced its intention to revise the rules concerning in-home care workers in its regulatory agenda published on April 28, 2010. This rulemaking effort has appeared in each subsequent regulatory agenda. The division also has discussed the companion regulatory action in public Web chats held after each regulatory agenda was published. The proposed rule would expand minimum wage and overtime protections by ensuring that all home care workers employed by third parties such as staffing agencies receive these protections. It also would clarify that individuals performing skilled in-home care work are entitled to minimum wage and overtime pay. However, families that engage individuals for true companionship or fellowship activities, such as visiting with friends or pursuing hobbies, still would be considered ""companions"" and not be required to meet the act's labor standards provisions. To learn more about the proposed rule, visit http://www.dol.gov/whd/flsa/companionNPRM.htm . The Wage and Hour Division is responsible for enforcing the FLSA, which was passed in 1938 to provide minimum wage and overtime protections for workers, prevent unfair competition among businesses based on subminimum wages, and spread employment by requiring employers whose employees work excessive hours to pay those employees at one and-one-half times their regular rates of pay for all hours worked over 40 in a week. Interested parties are invited to submit comments on or before March 12 at http://s.dol.gov/NA."
"February 17, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20120217,Statement by Labor Secretary Hilda L. Solis on extension of Unemployment Insurance benefits and the payroll tax cut,"WASHINGTON – Labor Secretary Hilda L. Solis has issued the following statement on congressional action today on the extension of Unemployment Insurance benefits and the payroll tax cut: ""I am pleased that congressional leaders have extended both unemployment insurance benefits for the long-term unemployed, and the payroll tax cut that is critical to so many working families. ""The payroll tax extension will put $1,000 back into the pockets of average working Americans over the next year. The unemployment insurance extension will continue to provide a lifeline to the 40 percent of unemployed Americans who have been out of work for long periods of time and who may no longer qualify for state unemployment insurance. The extension will also prevent 4.4 million individuals from exhausting their benefits, and will help another 8.1 million living in households with the long-term unemployed, including 3.1 million children. ""The extension also introduces innovative measures that were included in the American Jobs Act, which provide flexibility in the use of unemployment benefits to help the unemployed get back to work. Today's bill includes additional funds for re-employment services and funds to avert future layoffs. Moreover, the extension provides flexibility for the unemployed to get training, short-term employment or set up their own businesses. ""Today's action by the Congress is a win – not only for people, but also for our economy as a whole."""
"February 16, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20120216,Statement by Labor Secretary Hilda L. Solis on workforce investment,"WASHINGTON – The Government Accountability Office recently released and testified today on its report titled Workforce Investment Act: Innovative Collaborations Between Workforce Boards and Employers Helped Meet Local Needs (GAO-12-97). Labor Secretary Hilda L. Solis has issued the following statement: ""The findings in the report emphasized that stronger partnerships between employers and federally funded workforce programs lead to improved employment and retention outcomes for our nation's workers, something that the U.S. Department of Labor does very well through our Employment and Training Administration. The report also reaffirms the importance of reauthorizing the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 to help meet the needs of regional and local economies, and enhance the skills of workers to more effectively compete in the job market. ""As GAO points out in its report, we are working across federal agencies to streamline administrative processes and create better alignment of resources and programs to ensure effective service delivery. The Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education continue to seek opportunities to develop joint guidance to states and local grantees, and to implement cross-cutting demonstration projects that encourage partnerships and improve models for delivering quality services across programs at lower costs. ""In the report, GAO recommended that the Department of Labor compile information on local workforce boards 'that effectively leverage WIA funds with other funding sources and disseminate this information in a readily accessible manner.' We agree with GAO's recommendation. ""The department has begun work to design the next generation of online technical assistance for the public workforce system's leaders and practitioners, agency grantees, and other key partners and stakeholders. As part of this effort, we are developing ways to identify promising practices and incorporate and disseminate this information through guidance, virtual and in-person technical assistance, and outreach efforts. We will continue to take the necessary steps to improve the way our workforce system functions so that employers and workers alike can thrive in our economy."""

"February 16, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20120216,"Compliance at metal and nonmetal mines improving, says MSHA assistant secretary","ARLINGTON , Va. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration today announced that overall compliance with safety and health regulations is improving among the nation's more than 12,000 metal and nonmetal mining operations. Preliminary data indicate a 14 percent decrease in citations and orders issued at these mines – 74,373 in 2010 compared to 64,186 in 2011. Furthermore, the percentage that are significant and substantial citations and orders decreased from 33 percent in 2010 to 28 percent in 2011. Recent data show that impact inspections and the pattern of violations program also are contributing to improvements in compliance. ""We are moving in a positive direction,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""More operators are taking a greater responsibility for mine safety and health and, as a result, miners are better protected from injuries, illnesses and death; more money can be invested in mine safety rather than used to pay penalties for violations; and litigation is reduced."" Sixteen miners died in work-related accidents at metal/nonmetal mines in 2011, compared with 23 in 2010. In 2011, coal and metal/nonmental deaths dropped to the second-lowest number since statistics were first recorded in 1910. MSHA has engaged the metal/nonmetal industry in a number of specific outreach efforts to help mine operators achieve better compliance and make conditions safer and more healthful for miners. In collaboration with industry stakeholders, including state aggregate associations, MSHA developed a training program for guarding conveyor belts. The pictorial training tool, available on MSHA's website, has resulted in a 26 percent reduction in citations relating to guarding in 2011 compared with 2010. Additionally, ""Safety Pro in a Box"" was developed in partnership with the National Stone, Sand and Gravel Association to assist new aggregates operators in complying with safety and health regulations and standards. Through the 5002 health program, MSHA increased its focus on exposure monitoring at metal/nonmetal mines to ensure better worker protection from overexposure to harmful airborne contaminants. The initiative was executed through stakeholder outreach, education and training. Throughout both the metal/nonmetal and coal mining industries, MSHA has implemented a number of initiatives to promote consistency in enforcement, including the development of a two-week training program that all field office supervisors must take every two years; pre-assessment conferencing, resources permitting, in which mine operators and miners' representatives can request a conference with the MSHA district to resolve disputes involving citations and orders before they become matters of litigation; and ""Rules to Live By III,"" the latest phase of an outreach and enforcement program designed to strengthen efforts to prevent mining fatalities. A recent review of enforcement data on the 14 mines that received potential POV notices in 2010 indicate that, since completing the potential POV process, the total violation rate among these mines is down 21 percent, the total significant and substantial violation rate is down 38 percent and the rate of 104(d) closure orders is down 60 percent. The lost-time injury rate at these mines has dropped 39 percent. Since September 2010, when MSHA launched the current impact inspections program, violations per inspection hour are down 11 percent after mines received an initial impact inspection, the significant and substantial violation rate is down 18 percent and 104(d) orders are down 38 percent. The total lost-time injury rate at these mines is down 18 percent."

The layoffs primarily resulted from the termination of the Space Shuttle Program by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Many of the workers were contractors for the program at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center. The companies include Ares Aerospace & Technology Services, BAE Systems and Mobility Protection, Barrios Technology, Bastion Technologies Inc., Boeing, Cimmaron, ERC Inc., Fluor, GB Tech, Hamilton Sunstrand, Jacobs/IESCG, Lockheed Martin, MEI Technologies, MRI Technologies, Oceaneering Space Systems, REDE/Critique – NSS, SAIC, SGT, Tessada & Associates, U.S.A. and Wyle Life Sciences. ""The additional federal funding announced today will provide these workers continued access to job placement assistance, skills training and other re-employment services to help them find new careers in high-growth industries,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. On Sept. 8, 2010, a National Emergency Grant was approved for up to $5,367,340, with $2,221,564 released initially. Today's increment, awarded to the Texas Workforce Commission, completes the total funds awarded.

Topics include choosing a retirement savings plan and the advantages of direct deposits to small businesses and their employees. The webcast will focus on retirement savings options ranging from simplified employee pensions and savings incentive match plans for employees, otherwise known as SEPs and SIMPLE IRAs, to various types of 401(k) plans. The simpler options often require little or no paperwork, while 401(k) plans offer more flexibility in plan design. Some plans allow employees to make additional contributions as a way to grow their retirement savings. The U.S. Department of Labor will be joined by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants to discuss retirement savings options available for small businesses. The webcast will provide practical information and helpful tips to understand and compare these options while also providing insights on starting and operating a retirement savings plan.

"February 13, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20120213,US Department of Labor releases fiscal year 2013 budget request,"Budget reflects fiscal responsibility while investing in job training and worker protection WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor today outlined its part of the president's fiscal year 2013 budget request to Congress, which focuses on efficiently achieving the department's goals while exercising fiscal restraint. ""We are at a make or break moment for the middle class, and the Labor Department's fiscal year 2013 budget request reflects our commitment to supporting an American economy that's built to last,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""Our budget request focuses on programs that will help keep America's workforce strong and innovative, while providing needed worker protections. It also makes responsible and reasonable cuts that are rooted in current economic realities and a continued focus on increased efficiency and effectiveness."" The department's budget request totals $12.0 billion in discretionary funding. The budget invests in programs that help Americans find and keep jobs by providing training and employment opportunities for unemployed adults, dislocated workers, vulnerable communities and disadvantaged youth. The department will bolster its support for veterans through education, employment and other services that enable individuals newly separated from the military to successfully transition into civilian careers. As the economy gains strength, job training programs need to be as efficient and effective as possible. In order to test new ideas and replicate proven cost-effective strategies to help individuals acquire in-demand skills, the FY 2013 budget provides $125 million for a Workforce Innovation Fund with $100 million from the Department of Labor and a $25 million contribution from the U.S. Department of Education. The Departments of Labor and Education jointly will oversee this fund, which will utilize competitive grants to support innovative, systemic and evidence-based reforms in the workforce system. The Departments of Labor and Education also will work together on a new $8 billion Community College to Career Fund to help America's community colleges provide pathways to high-skilled jobs in high-growth industries. The Labor Department's FY 2013 budget request reflects many difficult choices and strategic consolidations. The budget discontinues the Women in Apprenticeship in Non-Traditional Occupations program and the Veterans Workforce Investment Program, but bolsters other veteran-focused activities, expands Registered Apprenticeships and improves service delivery innovation for all employment training programs through the Workforce Innovation Fund. The budget request also seeks to improve program outcomes and strengthen accountability for Job Corps through a thoughtful and transparent program assessment. To further enhance efficiency while still providing funding for department priorities, the budget request proposes the strategic consolidation of several regional offices. The budget request reflects the department's continued commitment to enhancing worker health and safety. It includes $16.9 million to continue efforts to help reduce an unacceptably large case backlog at the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission. The department is requesting an additional $5 million to bolster the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's enforcement of the numerous laws that protect workers and others from retaliation for reporting unsafe and unscrupulous practices. The budget proposes to strengthen the defined benefit pension system for the millions of Americans who rely on it by giving the board of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. authority to adjust premiums and directing the PBGC to take into account the risks that different sponsors pose to their retirees and to the PBGC itself. This action will encourage companies to fully fund their pension benefits and ensure the continued financial soundness of the PBGC. It is estimated that this proposal will save $16 billion over the next decade. In FY 2013, the department will continue to protect workers and level the playing field for businesses by providing the Wage and Hour Division with $10 million to combat worker misclassification and other violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Family and Medical Leave Act. When workers are misclassified as independent contractors, they are deprived of benefits and protections to which they are legally entitled, and law-abiding businesses are placed at a disadvantage against employers who violate the law. Additionally, the department's FY 2013 budget request continues past efforts to enhance program effectiveness and improve efficiency. The department will invest a minimum of $9 million in program evaluations to be overseen by the chief evaluation officer and requests continued authority to set aside funds from major program accounts for an increased number of evaluations. These investments will provide the department with valuable information about strategies and approaches that work so that resources are invested strategically.

"February 13, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20120213,"US Labor Department's OSHA cites 2 companies, proposes $288,000 in fines for workplace safety and health violations involving foreign students","Summer workers repackaged Hershey candies at Palmyra, Pa., facility PALMYRA , Pa. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration has cited Exel Inc. for nine – including six willful – workplace safety and health violations at the Eastern Distribution Center III, a facility in Palmyra owned by the Hershey Co. and operated by Exel. Proposed penalties total $283,000. OSHA also has cited the SHS Group LP, doing business as SHS Staffing Solutions, for one violation with a proposed penalty of $5,000. The agency's inspection was conducted in response to a complaint filed by the National Guestworker Alliance on behalf of a group of foreign students who were performing summer jobs at the Palmyra facility under the U.S. Department of State's J-1 visa program. Their visas were sponsored by the nonprofit organization Council for Educational Travel – USA. The complaint alleges a number of abuses of the visa program, which is designed to promote cultural exchange, as well as exploitative and unsafe conditions in the workplace. Under a contract with Exel, SHS Staffing Solutions hired the students to work at the Palmyra site repackaging Hershey candies for promotional displays. Exel is a contract logistics provider headquartered in Westerville, Ohio, with more than 40,000 employees at more than 500 sites in North America. Exel was responsible for record keeping in the Palmyra facility. OSHA has cited the six willful violations with penalties totaling $280,000 for failing to record injuries and illnesses on the OSHA 300 log for four years, evaluate the accuracy of the 300 logs before certifying them for three years, and develop and implement an effective hearing conservation program. A willful violation is one committed with intentional knowledge or voluntary disregard for the law's requirements, or with plain indifference to worker safety and health. ""Nothing useful can be learned from an unrecorded injury,"" said OSHA Assistant Secretary Dr. David Michaels. ""Accurate records provide critical information to employers and employees about the cause and prevention of work-related injuries. The law requires employers to maintain complete and accurate records because, without these, it is more difficult to prevent additional injuries and illnesses from occurring."" SHS Staffing Solutions, a temporary staffing provider headquartered in Lemoyne, has been cited with one serious violation for failing to provide training to employees on the lockout/tagout of energy sources. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known. Exel also has been cited for three other-than-serious violations carrying a $3,000 penalty related to inadequate record keeping. An other-than-serious violation is one that probably would not cause death or serious physical harm. Additionally, the Labor Department's Wage and Hour Division is investigating potential violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act relating to the work performed by the CETUSA-sponsored foreign students. Because CETUSA has withheld documents from investigators, the secretary of labor filed a petition to enforce an administrative subpoena against CETUSA in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania in order to complete this investigation. On Feb. 7, Judge William W. Caldwell ordered CETUSA to file a response on or before Feb. 20 to explain to the court why the documents have not been produced. CETUSA has filed a response pursuant to the court's order, and further proceedings before Caldwell are anticipated. Both Exel and SHS Staffing Solutions have 15 business days from receipt of their citations and penalties to comply, ask for an informal conference with OSHA's area director, or contest the citations and proposed penalties before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission To ask questions, obtain compliance assistance, file a complaint, or report workplace hospitalizations, fatalities or situations posing imminent danger to workers, the public should call OSHA's toll-free hotline at 800-321-OSHA (6742) or the agency's Harrisburg Area Office at 717-782-3902 Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. OSHA's role is to ensure these conditions for America's working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education and assistance.

"February 13, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20120213-0,US Department of Labor sues defunct Georgia software company to restore assets to company’s 401(k) retirement plan,"MARIETTA, Ga. – The U.S. Department of Labor has sued By Design Consulting Corp. and its owner, Randall Williamson Smith, to restore $25,978.39 in assets to the defunct company’s 401(k) retirement plan after an investigation by the department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration found violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. “Employees should expect that their hard-earned savings will be properly managed when they contribute to retirement plans. The Labor Department holds all fiduciaries – in this case the employer – accountable to act in the best interests of plan participants,” said Isabel Colon, EBSA’s regional director in Atlanta. Filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, Atlanta Division, the lawsuit alleges that between August 2006 and April 2009, the company withheld and failed to remit $23,737.50 in employee contributions to the By Design Consulting Corp. 401(k) Retirement Plan. Between May 2005 and April 2009, the defendants failed to ensure that amounts withheld from employees’ paychecks were remitted to the plan as soon as they could reasonably be segregated from the assets of the employer. Participant contributions, which were withheld on a biweekly basis, were regularly remitted between 30 and 386 calendar days after being withheld, resulting in lost interest and opportunity costs. In May 2006, the plan granted a loan of $14,919.03 to a plan participant without requiring any promissory note or other loan documentation. Between August 2006 and April 2009, the company withheld $2,240.89 from the plan participant’s paychecks as loan repayments but failed to forward those funds to the retirement plan. The suit further alleges that the defendants’ retention of participant contributions and loan repayments constitutes a direct or indirect transfer of plan assets or use for the benefit of the company, and the defendants dealt with the assets of the plan in their own interest and for their own account by engaging in transactions that are prohibited by ERISA. The Labor Department is asking the court to order that the plan be set off of Smith’s individual retirement plan account against the amount of losses resulting from his fiduciary breaches, unless the losses are otherwise restored to the plan by the defendants. The suit asks that the defendants be ordered to restore to the plan all losses, including lost earnings and opportunity costs, which occurred as a result of the breaches of their fiduciary obligations, and be permanently barred from serving as fiduciaries for any employee benefit plan subject to ERISA. By Design Consulting Corp. was located in Marietta, Ga., and sold and installed computer software until the company was administratively dissolved in September 2010. This case was investigated by EBSA’s Atlanta Regional Office. It is being litigated by the Labor Department’s Regional Office of the Solicitor in Atlanta. Employers and workers can contact EBSA at 404-302-3900 or toll-free at 866-444-3272 for help with problems relating to private sector retirement and health plans.

"February 10, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20120210,US Labor Department announces comprehensive final rule on H-2B foreign labor certification program,"Rule aims to make jobs more accessible to US workers and strengthen worker protections WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor's Employment and Training Administration and its Wage and Hour Division today announced a final rule to improve the H-2B temporary nonagricultural worker program. The rule, to be published in the Feb. 21 edition of the Federal Register , includes changes to several aspects of the program to ensure that U.S. workers receive greater access to jobs and strengthens worker protections. The H-2B program allows the entry of foreign workers into the United States on a temporary basis when qualified U.S. workers are not available, and the employment of those foreign workers will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of U.S. workers. The H-2B program is limited by law to a cap of 66,000 visas per year. ""The H-2B program is designed to help businesses when there is a temporary shortage of U.S. workers,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""The rule announced today will ensure that the program is used as intended by making these jobs more accessible to U.S. workers and providing stronger protections for every worker."" The department responded to comments received from employers and worker advocates in drafting the final rule, providing employers with greater flexibility and certainty throughout the application and recruitment processes as well as improving U.S. workers' access to jobs. The final rule creates a national registry for all H-2B job postings and increases the amount of time during which U.S. workers must be recruited. The rule also requires the rehiring of former employees when available. In addition, H-2B program benefits such as transportation costs and wages will be extended to U.S. workers performing substantially the same work as H-2B workers. Worker protections also will be strengthened by enhanced transparency throughout the employment process. The rule will be effective on April 23. It can be viewed at http://s.dol.gov/MZ.

"February 9, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20120209,US Labor Departments MSHA seeks information for miners rights survey,"ARLINGTON , Va. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration is seeking public comment on data collection relating to miners' rights in the workplace. The agency is performing a pilot study to determine how to survey miners' understanding of their rights under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 and the degree to which they believe they are free to exercise those rights at work. MSHA is the third agency in the department to initiate this type of survey, following the Wage and Hour Division and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. ""What we hope to ultimately learn from this pilot and subsequent survey is how we can better educate miners on their rights to safe and healthful working conditions,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""If a miner is denied the right to participate in safeguarding health and safety at his or her mine, it puts at risk not only the miner's safety, but the safety of fellow miners."" MSHA aims to implement an anonymous survey in a setting and format that will result in candid and reliable responses. In order to achieve this, the agency is performing the pilot study to investigate the efficacy of different data collection methods and to develop an appropriate survey instrument for the mining community. While the current pilot is focused on coal miners and coal mining communities, MSHA's goal is to determine how to measure miners' knowledge and willingness to exercise rights under the Mine Act across all mining sectors. ""The overarching goal is for miners to be able to address health and safety concerns at work,"" added Main. ""But in order to achieve that goal, we've first got to pinpoint the reasons why some don't speak up. We heard testimony at congressional field hearings after the Upper Big Branch disaster about miners who were afraid to make safety complaints for fear of losing their jobs. We want to know what areas of the country and in what mining sectors this and other factors affect miners' exercise of their rights. MSHA highlighted the importance of gathering this information in a meeting this week with stakeholders representing miners. The agency also discussed the development of materials to aid miners and miners' representatives in carrying out their rights and responsibilities under the Mine Act. Comments will be accepted until March 19, 2012. For more information or to submit comments, visit http://www.msha.gov/DOLICR01192012/DOLICR1192012.asp ."

ODEP's curriculum, which covers communication, networking, enthusiasm and attitude, teamwork, problem-solving, critical thinking and professionalism, is based on the results of a survey of prominent businesses to determine what they believe to be the most important competencies and skills for young workers. According to recent surveys, nearly three-quarters of employers indicated high school graduates were deficient in such basic skills as punctuality, verbal communication and working productively with others. Businesses across the nation have identified soft skills as crucial to the hiring and employment success of all workers. ""Dressing appropriately, showing up on time and networking with co-workers are all crucial to finding and keeping a job,"" said Kathy Martinez, assistant secretary of labor for disability employment policy. ""For many young people these skills are not intuitive. We hope educators, human resource professionals, job clubs and faith-based organizations will use the curriculum to help our youth build the skills to succeed in the workplace."" Available in English and Spanish, ""Skills to Pay the Bills"" was field-tested by youth service professionals and students across the country.

"February 9, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20120209,"US Labor Department, California sign agreement to reduce misclassification of employees as independent contractor","WASHINGTON — Nancy J. Leppink, deputy administrator of the U.S. Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division, and California Secretary of Labor Marty Morgenstern have entered into a memorandum of understanding regarding the improper classification of employees as independent contractors. Leppink and California Labor Commissioner Julie A. Su hosted a press teleconference Feb. 9 during which they discussed how the U.S. Department of Labor and the state of California will embark on new efforts, guided by this memorandum, to protect the rights of employees and level the playing field for responsible employers by reducing the practice conducted by some businesses of misclassifying employees. This partnership is the 12th of its kind for the U.S. Department of Labor. ""This memorandum of understanding helps us send a message: We are standing together with the state of California to end the practice of misclassifying employees,"" said Leppink. ""This is an important step toward making sure that the American dream is still available for workers and responsible employers alike."" ""California is proud to enter into this partnership with the U.S. Department of Labor to work together to attack the problems of the underground economy,"" said Su. ""Gov. Brown just signed an important law that went into effect on Jan. 1, increasing penalties for willful misclassification. With the Labor Department, we are poised to use all the tools in our arsenal to lift the floor for hardworking employers and employees throughout the state."" Employee misclassification is a growing problem. In 2011, the Wage and Hour Division collected more than $5 million in back wages for minimum wage and overtime violations under the Fair Labor Standards Act that resulted from employees being misclassified as independent contractors or otherwise not treated as employees. Business models that attempt to change, obscure or eliminate the employment relationship are not inherently illegal, unless they are used to evade compliance with the law. The misclassification of employees as something else, such as independent contractors, presents a serious problem, as these employees often are denied access to critical benefits and protections — such as family and medical leave, overtime compensation, minimum wage pay and Unemployment Insurance — to which they are entitled. In addition, misclassification can create economic pressure for law-abiding business owners, who often struggle to compete with those who are skirting the law.Employee misclassification also generates substantial losses for state Unemployment Insurance and workers' compensation funds. Memorandums of understanding with state government agencies arose as part of the U.S. Department of Labor's Misclassification Initiative, which was launched under the auspices of Vice President Biden's Middle Class Task Force with the goal of preventing, detecting and remedying employee misclassification. Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Utah and Washington have signed similar agreements. More information is available on the U.S. Department of Labor's misclassification Web page at http://www.dol.gov/misclassification/ . The mission of the U.S. Department of Labor is to foster, promote and develop the welfare of the wage earners, job seekers and retirees of the United States; improve working conditions; advance opportunities for profitable employment; and ensure work-related benefits and rights.

Barrett III for breach of fiduciary duty with respect to the company’s 401(k) plan. According to the suit, more than $775,000 from the 401(k) plan was invested in a fraudulent scheme in 2006, in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. This amount represented nearly all of the assets in the accounts of the 19 plan participants as of the end of 2005. The suit resulted from an investigation by the department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration and was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. It alleges that the defendants failed to adequately or prudently research the credentials of the financial representative they retained, and failed to adequately or prudently research or analyze the investment of plan assets in the Transcontinental Airlines Employee Investment Savings Account, a fraudulent scheme orchestrated by Louis Pearlman, who is serving 25 years in federal prison. “These acts have jeopardized the retirement security of former Dynasty employees by those charged with the responsibility of protecting workers’ benefits,” said Phyllis C. Borzi, assistant secretary of labor for employee benefits security. “The Labor Department will not stand for it, and we will take all actions necessary to make sure workers receive their hard-earned benefits.” The suit seeks to restore to the plan all losses, including interest and lost opportunity costs. It also would require the defendants to provide all books, documents and records relating to the finances and administration of the plan, as well as remove the defendants as fiduciaries of the plan and any other employee benefit plan for which they act as fiduciaries. The defendants would be permanently enjoined from acting directly or indirectly in any fiduciary capacity with respect to any employee benefit plan, and permanently enjoined from exercising any custody, control or decision-making authority with respect to the assets of any employee benefit plan covered by ERISA. Finally, the suit seeks the appointment of an independent fiduciary to manage and administer the plan. Dynasty Construction Inc. ceased operations in 2007. The investigation was conducted by EBSA’s Washington District Office in Silver Spring, Md., and the suit was filed by the department’s regional solicitor in Philadelphia.

The Office of Accountability originally was created in response to internal reviews of the Sago, Aracoma and Darby mine disasters that were critical of MSHA's pre-accident enforcement activities and questioned whether policies intended to prevent serious mine disasters were being properly and effectively implemented. By establishing headquarters accountability functions within the OAASEI, MSHA will enhance the management, administrative and analytical support for this program while retaining its independence from the mine inspection program areas. To support the goals of the reorganization, MSHA also will create a new deputy director position for Investigations, Special Enforcement and Accountability. This section includes the existing Technical Compliance and Investigations Office. It will provide centralized oversight of special investigations and special enforcement activities such as the POV and impact inspection programs; manage the evaluation and development of strategies to improve the use of other enforcement tools, such as flagrant violations and special assessments; and work closely with the OAASEI director in conducting quantitative analyses to monitor mine operators' performance, and continuing to develop and refine special enforcement strategies that improve the health and safety of miners who are most at risk. In addition, MSHA is establishing a special enforcement and analysis branch within the OAASEI to provide the analytical and programmatic support to administer and refine special enforcement programs such as POV and impact inspections. The branch also will provide analytical support for the office's accountability and assessment functions. ""MSHA conducts regular mandated inspections and enforcement actions to support compliance in U.S. mines,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""However, some mines require targeted, enhanced enforcement methods. The formation of OAASEI will enable MSHA to better manage and coordinate its use of special enforcement tools against the most serious violators of the Mine Act. ""Furthermore, the new organization will strengthen accountability and demonstrate that MSHA is committed to ensuring that miners know their rights under the Mine Act and is protecting those who exercise their rights from retaliation or discrimination,"" he added. The recently enacted fiscal 2012 appropriations bill realigned funding in support of this reorganization. The reorganization includes moving personnel from other MSHA budget activities, as well as adding specially trained investigators for potential criminal and whistleblower issues."
"February 7, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ofccp/ofccp20120207,US Labor Department extends comment period on proposed rule to improve employment opportunities for workers with disabilities,"Interested parties may submit comments through Feb. 21 WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs has announced a 14-day extension of the comment period for its proposed rule to revise regulations implementing Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which obligates most federal contractors and subcontractors to ensure equal employment opportunity for qualified workers with disabilities. On Dec. 9, 2011, OFCCP published a notice of proposed rulemaking in 76 Federal Register 77056 with a comment period originally set to end on Feb. 7, 2012. After reviewing requests for an extension, OFCCP has extended the comment period by 14 days until Tuesday, Feb. 21. This action will provide additional time for interested parties to analyze the issues raised in the proposal and to provide their comments. Individuals and organizations who already have submitted comments may use the extension period to revise or add to their original comments. To learn more about the proposed rule and submit comments, visit http://www.dol.gov/ofccp/503/ . The rule proposed by OFCCP would strengthen the affirmative action and reporting obligations of federal contractors by requiring them to set a hiring goal of having 7 percent of their employees be qualified workers with disabilities. The proposed changes also detail mandatory actions contractors would have to take in the areas of recruitment, training, record-keeping and dissemination of affirmative action policies — obligations similar to those that have long been required to promote workplace equality for women and minorities. In addition, the rule would clarify OFCCP's expectations of contractors by providing specific guidance on how to comply with the law. In addition to Section 503, OFCCP enforces Executive Order 11246 and the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974. As amended, these three laws require those who do business with the federal government, both contractors and subcontractors, to follow the fair and reasonable standard that they take affirmative action and not discriminate in employment on the basis of sex, race, color, religion, national origin, disability or status as a protected veteran.

The economy added 257,000 private sector jobs last month, exceeding expectations, while the unemployment rate dropped to 8.3 percent – its lowest level since February 2009. These numbers show that the labor market continues on a positive trajectory. ""We've created 3.7 million private sector jobs over the last 23 months, according to revised numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. January's job growth was the strongest in nine months. The unemployment rate among African-Americans fell by 2.2 percent in January down to 13.6 percent – the largest one-month drop in recorded history. ""The national unemployment rate has fallen by 0.8 percent in the last five months. The drop in unemployment has been driven by employment gains, not workers leaving the labor force. ""We're seeing accelerated growth in our labor force across almost every industry. The manufacturing industry surged in January, adding 50,000 jobs. Over the past year, we've added 235,000 manufacturing jobs. More products are rolling off the assembly line marked made in the USA.' We can build on this encouraging trend if Congress acts on the president's proposals to remove tax incentives for companies that ship American jobs overseas and invests in training programs so our workers can fill existing openings in advanced manufacturing. ""We're also seeing new growth in construction. This sector has added 52,000 jobs over the last two months, the largest increase in construction jobs since 2007.

The U.S. Department of Labor has filed a lawsuit against Towson Rehabilitation Center LLC and chief executive officer Howard Neels for failing to remit employees’ contributions to the company’s 401(k) plan, in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The suit resulted from an investigation by the Washington District Office of the department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration, which found that, since January 2006, the defendants have failed to remit employee contributions to the plan, remitted certain employee contributions late without interest and failed to segregate the plan’s assets from the general assets of the company. “This case clearly demonstrates a breach of fiduciary duty,” said Norman Jackson, EBSA’s acting regional director in Philadelphia. “We will hold fiduciaries accountable when they fail to act in the best interest of plan participants.” Filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, the suit seeks to restore to the plan all losses, including interest and opportunity costs, as well as the cost of an independent fiduciary. The suit also seeks to permanently bar the defendants from serving in a fiduciary capacity to any employee benefit plan covered by ERISA, and appoint an independent fiduciary with plenary authority and control with respect to the management and administration of the plan.

Solis today issued the following statement commemorating National African-American History Month: ""This month, I am proud to celebrate the innumerable accomplishments of the African-American community to awakening our highest ideals and enriching our national life. From growing our economy to fighting for equal justice to opening the eyes of a nation to the dignity of work, the relentless pride and resolve of our African-American brothers and sisters have advanced our democratic experiment and provided a beacon of hope around the world. ""The story of African-American resilience and this community's emergence from bondage to betterment carries powerful lessons about the limitless potential of the human race. In these challenging economic times, when so many African-Americans in communities throughout our country have rejected despair and instead shown their steadfast determination to create a better life for themselves and their families, I recall the words of the great Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who once said, ""I have the audacity to believe that peoples everywhere can have three meals a day for their bodies, education and culture for their minds, and dignity, equality and freedom for their spirits."""
"February 2, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20120202,"Assistant Secretary of Labor for Mine Safety and Health Joseph Main: mine safety and health improving through collective efforts of government, industry","CHARLESTON , W.Va. – In a speech before attendees of the West Virginia Coal Association's 39th Annual Mining Symposium in Charleston today, Assistant Secretary of Labor Joseph A. Main discussed the current state of mine safety and health – and ongoing efforts to improve it – by both the U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration and the mining industry at large. Main highlighted a number of strategic initiatives that have been implemented which the agency believes have markedly improved miner safety and health, including monthly impact inspections, the pattern of violations program, and education and outreach within the industry. ""I believe the actions we have taken at MSHA, along with those of the mining industry, are making a difference and making mines safer for the nation's miners,"" said Main. ""Enhanced enforcement and regulatory and administrative changes, along with increased compliance and responsibility from the industry, have resulted in gains for the cause of miner safety. ""But,"" he added, ""I believe more can be done to ensure that the nation's miners can go to work, put in their shifts, and return home safe and healthy each day."" MSHA's impact inspection program began in force in April 2010 following the explosion at the Upper Big Branch Mine. Since then, the agency has conducted 387 impact inspections and issued 7,655 citations, orders and safeguards. ""Overall compliance is improving at mines receiving impact inspections,"" said Main. ""Violations per inspection hour are down 11 percent after mines received an initial impact inspection. Significant and substantial violation rates are down 18 percent; 104(d) orders are down 38 percent. The total self-reported lost-time injury rate at these mines is down 18 percent."" ""We believe our changes to the pattern of violations process also are improving safety,"" Main said. ""Since November 2010, 28 potential pattern of violations notices have been issued at 26 mines. Two POV notices were issued, the first time any mine was successfully placed on POV and issued closure orders in the Mine Act's 33-year history. Since completing the PPOV process, the total violation rate among 14 mines that received PPOV notices in 2010 is down 21 percent, the total S&S violation rate is down 38 percent, and the rate of 104(d) withdrawal orders is down 60 percent. The lost-time injury rate at these mines has dropped 39 percent."" Preliminary data indicate that compliance by mine operators is improving. In 2011, MSHA inspected approximately 14,000 mines and issued 157,894 citations and orders, down from 171,373 in 2010. Forty-nine percent of those violations were cited at underground coal mines, a sector representing only 5 percent of the total mines inspected. It's also a sector that continues to grow. The number of underground coal mines increased by nearly 6 percent, and the number of mining units increased by nearly 9 percent. ""Underground coal mines unquestionably have the most challenging compliance issues and received much of the agency's attention,"" said Main. Thirty-seven miners died in work-related accidents last year, the second lowest since statistics have been recorded. Main noted that the first year the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 was in effect, 273 miners died. ""We've seen those numbers continue to fall since then, and the distance to zero is much shorter now than it was in 1977,"" he said. Main outlined other important initiatives implemented under his watch that have resulted in positive reform: Rules to Live By: This multi-phase initiative, in phase one, focused on the most common mining deaths and standards cited most often in mining death investigations. Phase two focused on preventing catastrophic accidents, and phase three, launched this week, will highlight 14 safety standards chosen because violations related to each have been cited as contributing to at least five mining accidents and at least five deaths during a 10-year period. Pre-assessment conferencing process: Implemented in districts where resources permit, the pre-assessment conferencing process allows disputes to be resolved before they are contested and added to the backlog of contested cases. Backlog: Additional resources provided by Congress have enabled MSHA to lessen the total backlog of contested cases before the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission from almost 89,000 citations in January 2011 to fewer than 67,000 in December 2011, a 25 percent reduction. Regulatory actions: MSHA's regulatory reforms have focused on ending black lung disease, using proximity detection devices to prevent deaths and crushing injuries from continuous mining machines, revising pattern of violations rules and increasing rock dust use to suppress explosions. Consistency in mine inspections: MSHA improved oversight of the inspection program and consistency in the enforcement of the Mine Act with a new training program for all field office supervisors. To date, all supervisors have received the training and will receive re-training every two years. The agency also is overhauling mine inspection handbooks, updating inspection procedures and policies, and addressing issues identified during agency audits and internal reviews. Since arriving at MSHA more than two years ago, Main has placed the agency on an aggressive path to improve mine safety and health. He noted, however, that the tragedy that occurred at the Upper Big Branch Mine just months after his appointment changed everything. ""It unquestionably shook the very foundation of mine safety and health, and caused all of us to take a deeper look at the weaknesses in the safety net expected to protect the nation's miners,"" said Main. Main affirmed that one of the pivotal keys to improved mine safety and health is for mine operators to take more responsibility. He noted that, while there are mine operators who implement safety and health programs and work to comply with safety and health rules, there are others who ignore the regulations in place and put their workers at risk of accidents and injuries. ""Bringing those who do not comply up to the standards of those who do – that should be a goal of all in the mining industry,"" he said. Main wrapped up his remarks by acknowledging the challenges MSHA continually faces. ""MSHA cannot be at every mining operation every shift of every day,"" he said. ""There aren't enough resources to do that. The law clearly places the responsibility of maintaining a safe and healthful workplace squarely on the operator's shoulders. Improved mine safety and health is a result of operators taking up that responsibility and exercising it. Taking more ownership means finding and fixing problems and violations of the laws and rules before MSHA finds them – or more importantly – before a miner becomes ill, is injured or dies. Many mines all across this country operate every day while adhering to sound health and safety programs. There is no reason that every mine cannot do the same.""

The measures will expand transparency in the 401(k) plan marketplace and broaden the availability of retirement plan options so that Americans can maximize their ability to save responsibly and securely. The U.S. Department of Labor’s Employee Benefits Security Administration issued a final rule that will provide employers sponsoring pension and 401(k) plans with information about the administrative and investment costs associated with providing such plans to their workers. The department also announced a 3-month extension in the effective date of this rule, meaning service providers must be in compliance by July 1, 2012, for new and existing contracts or arrangements between Employee Retirement Income Security Act-covered plans and service providers. “As President Obama has said, we’re at a make or break moment for the middle class and those trying to reach it. What’s at stake is the American value that hard work pays off. The common-sense rule that we are finalizing today will shed light on the true costs of 401(k) accounts and ultimately reward those working hard and saving for retirement,” said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. “This rule, and its companion participant-level fee disclosure rule, will greatly increase the level of transparency in retirement plans. When businesses that sponsor retirement plans, and the workers who participate in those plans, get better information on associated fees and expenses, they’ll be able to shop around and make informed decisions that will lead to cost savings and a larger nest egg at retirement.” The Treasury Department’s proposal will reduce regulatory burdens and make it easier for retirees to choose to receive their benefits as a stream of income in regular payments for as long as they live. These flexible “lifetime income” options can provide greater certainty in retirement and minimize the risk of retirees outliving or underutilizing their retirement savings. “When American workers take the responsible step of saving for retirement, we should do all we can to provide them with sensible, accessible choices for managing their hard-earned savings. Having the ability to choose from expanded options will help retirees and their families achieve both greater value and security,” said Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner. Together, the actions by both the Treasury and Labor Departments will expand available options and provide greater transparency to help working families successfully plan for retirement and manage their retirement savings. The Council of Economic Advisers has prepared a detailed report describing the significance of today’s actions, which can be accessed at www.whitehouse.gov/sites/dolgov/files/legacy-files/cea_retirement_report_01312012_final.pdf (link is external) . More about the Labor Department’s final rule on 401(k) fee disclosure The Labor Department’s rule requires service providers to furnish information that will enable pension plan fiduciaries to determine both the reasonableness of compensation paid to the service providers and any conflicts of interest that may impact a service provider’s performance under a service contract or arrangement. It requires disclosures of direct and indirect compensation certain service providers receive in connection with the services they provide. The rule applies to those service providers that expect to receive $1,000 or more in compensation and provide certain fiduciary or registered investment advisory services, make available plan investment options in connection with brokerage or record-keeping services or otherwise receive indirect compensation for providing certain services to a plan. The department today also announced that in the near future it intends to publish for public comment a separate proposal that would require service providers, in addition to providing the required fee and investment expense information, to furnish a guide or similar tool to assist plan fiduciaries in identifying and locating the potentially complex information that must be disclosed and which may be located in multiple documents. The 3-month extension of the effective date of today’s final rule has been provided to allow service providers sufficient time to prepare for compliance. Service providers not in compliance as of July 1 will be in violation of ERISA’s prohibited transaction rules and subject to penalties under the Internal Revenue Code. The effective date of the final rule announced today works in conjunction with the compliance date of the department’s participant-level disclosure regulation (29 Code of Federal Regulations 2550.404a-5) which requires plan administrators to give workers who direct their retirement accounts in 401(k)-type plans easy-to-understand information in order to comparison shop among the plan investment options available to them. Due to the extension of the effective date of the final rule, plan administrators for calendar year plans now must make the initial annual disclosure of “plan-level” and “investment-level” information (including associated fees and expenses) to participants no later than Aug. 30, 2012, and the first quarterly statement (for fees incurred July through September) must be furnished no later than Nov. 14, 2012. Plan sponsors and service providers with questions about the final rule can contact EBSA’s Office of Regulations and Interpretations at 202-693-8500. A fact sheet on this regulation is available on EBSA’s website at www.dol.gov/ebsa/newsroom/fs408b2finalreg.html . Additional information about how the final rule announced today differs from the previously published interim final rule can be seen by visiting www.dol.gov/ebsa/408b2changes.html . More about the Treasury Department’s proposed Guidance Package on Lifetime Income As Americans live longer and pensions increasingly trend away from the traditional defined-benefit structure that provides a stream of guaranteed income for the duration of a retiree’s life, improving access to lifetime income options is an important way to help retirees manage their savings. Lifetime income is particularly important for women, as the average lifespan for an American woman exceeds that of a man. Many retirees find it hard to devise and adhere to a methodical plan for managing and drawing down retirement assets over an uncertain, and potentially lengthy, time horizon. Some retirees may forecast that they will live only to or just past the average life expectancy, only to far outlive their savings. Other retirees, fearful of exhausting their savings, may unnecessarily restrict their spending and not reap the benefits of the funds they have saved. Since Americans’ financial prospects for retirement increasingly are determined not solely by how much they save but also by how they manage their savings, retirement policy should focus both on how best to encourage the accumulation of savings and on how to give retirees attractive options for using that accumulation to provide retirement income. Today’s guidance package, which builds on comments received in response to the departments’ joint request for information on the desirability and availability of lifetime income alternatives in retirement plans, will help Americans meet their need for income during retirement by: Encouraging partial annuity options. Retirement plan participants often are confronted with a “cash or annuity” decision upon retirement. Given an all-or-nothing choice, many opt for a lump sum and decline the lifetime income stream because they are unaware they have the option to combine approaches. The proposed regulation changes a regulatory requirement to make it simpler for defined benefit pension plans to offer combinations of lifetime income and a single-sum cash payment. This is designed to encourage more retirees to consider partial annuities, which allow for retirees to receive a steady stream of income for the duration of their lifetimes while also keeping a portion of their savings invested in assets with the flexibility to respond to liquidity needs. Removing a key obstacle to “longevity” annuities. Another proposed regulation expands on the combination approach by removing a regulatory impediment to purchasing a deferred “longevity” annuity. This change would make it easier for retirees to use a limited portion of their savings to purchase guaranteed income for life starting at an advanced age, such as average life expectancy. Annuities of this type would provide an efficient way for 65- or 70-year-olds (or even younger savers) to address the risk of outliving their assets by purchasing a predictable income stream starting at age 80 or 85. Once that risk is addressed, a retiree’s task of generating income from the remaining assets is more manageable because it is limited to a fixed period of time. Clarifying rules for plan rollovers to purchase annuities and spousal protection rules for 401(k) deferred annuities. Two revenue rulings issued today clarify how rules protecting employees and spouses apply when plan sponsors offer lifetime income options under their plans. The first ruling clarifies how the rules apply when employees are given the option to use a single-sum 401(k) payout to obtain a low-cost annuity from their employer’s defined benefit pension plan. The second ruling clarifies that employers can offer their employees the option to use 401(k) savings to purchase deferred annuities and still satisfy spousal protection rules with minimal administrative burdens. Both of these rulings would facilitate the availability of flexible options for employees so that they can better use their 401(k) savings to achieve financial security in retirement. Additional information on these proposals is available in a fact sheet posted at www.treasury.gov. The proposed regulations announced today are also available at www.regulations.gov for public comment.

The repeat violations, with $70,000 in penalties, include the company's failure to guard machines with moving parts as well as to develop, document and use procedures for controlling hazardous energy.The company was cited for the same violations at its East Longmeadow, Mass., and Lenexa, Kan., facilities in 2011.A repeat violation exists when an employer previously has been cited for the same or a similar violation of a standard, regulation, rule or order at any other facility in federal enforcement states within the last five years. Due to the repeat violations and the nature of the hazards, OSHA has placed Vertis Communications in its Severe Violator Enforcement Program, which mandates targeted follow-up inspections to ensure compliance with the law. The program focuses on recalcitrant employers that endanger workers by committing willful, repeat or failure-to-abate violations. For more information on SVEP, visit http://s.dol.gov/J3.

""The grant from the U.S. Department of Labor announced today is but one effort to help ensure that Colombia has all the tools it needs to carry out this commitment."" The ILO presence will support the implementation of the Colombia Action Plan Related to Labor Rights through a variety of direct assistance activities. In April 2011, the plan was concluded between Colombia and the United States. Under it, Colombia committed to a series of measures to improve protection of labor rights, prevent labor violence and increase prosecution of the perpetrators of such violence. These commitments lay the groundwork for significant labor rights improvements in Colombia. To date, Colombia has met each milestone in the action plan. Solis acknowledged that much work remains to achieve the full potential of the plan for Colombia's workers and reaffirmed her full commitment to work with Minister Pardo to overcome challenges."
"February 1, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20120201,US Labor Department to re-propose 'parental exemption' of child labor in agriculture rule,"Additional review will ensure protection of both children and rural values WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division today announced that it will re-propose the portion of its regulation on child labor in agriculture interpreting the ""parental exemption."" The decision to re-propose is in part a response to requests from the public and members of Congress that the agency allow an opportunity for more input on this aspect of the rule. Following the president's historic executive order on regulation, issued in January 2011, this re-proposal reflects the department's careful attention to public comments and its conclusion that it is appropriate to provide the public with further opportunities to participate in the regulatory process. The parental exemption allows children of any age who are employed by their parent, or a person standing in the place of a parent, to perform any job on a farm owned or operated by their parent or such person standing in the place of a parent. Congress created the parental exemption in 1966 when it expanded protections for children employed in agriculture and prohibited their employment in jobs the Department of Labor declared particularly hazardous for children under the age of 16 to perform. The department recognizes the unique attributes of farm families and rural communities. The re-proposal process will seek comments and inputs as to how the department can comply with statutory requirements to protect children, while respecting rural traditions. The re-proposed portion of the rule is expected to be published for public comment by early summer. The department will continue to review the comments received regarding the remaining portions of the proposed rule for inclusion in a final rule. Until the revised exemption is final, the Wage and Hour Division will apply the parental exemption to situations in which the parent or person standing in the place of a parent is a part owner of the farm, a partner in a partnership or an officer of a corporation that owns the farm if the ownership interest in the partnership or corporation is substantial. This approach is consistent with guidance the Wage and Hour Division has provided to the public on its website for the past several years. ""The Department of Labor appreciates and respects the role of parents in raising their children and assigning tasks and chores to their children on farms and of relatives such as grandparents, aunts and uncles in keeping grandchildren, nieces and nephews out of harm's way,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""Today's announcement to re-propose the parental exemption means the department will have the benefit of additional public comment, and the public will have an opportunity to consider a revised approach to this issue. We will continue to work closely with the U.S. Department of Agriculture to ensure that our child labor in agriculture rule generally, and the parental exemption specifically, fully reflect input from rural communities."" ""I want to applaud Secretary Solis and the Department of Labor for their decision to re-propose this portion of the rule to ensure kids across the nation have the opportunity to learn the value and reward of good old-fashioned farm work, while still providing protection to children from the most dangerous aspects of farming,"" said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. ""The Labor Department listened to farmers and ranchers across the country. This announcement and the additional opportunity for comment represent a common-sense approach to strengthen our agricultural economy while keeping farm kids safe. It reflects the Obama administration's commitment to the American values that will keep our rural and agricultural economies growing, and keep rural communities and families prosperous."" The department published and invited public comments on its proposed rule on child labor in agriculture on Sept. 2, 2011. The proposed rule aimed to increase protections for children working in agriculture while preserving the benefits that safe and healthy work can provide. The Wage and Hour Division was driven to update its 40-year-old child labor regulations by studies showing that children are significantly more likely to be killed while performing agricultural work than while working in all other industries combined. The department's child labor in agriculture statutory authority extends only to children employed in agriculture who are 15 years of age or younger. The department will continue to consider feedback from the public, Congress and the Department of Agriculture on portions of the rule outside of the parental exemption before it is finalized."

"January 31, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20120131,MSHA begins 3rd phase of Rules to Live By outreach and enforcement initiative,"Fatality prevention program to focus on 14 safety standards ARLINGTON, Va. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration today launched the third phase of an outreach and enforcement program designed to strengthen efforts to prevent mining fatalities. ""Rules to Live By III: Preventing Common Mining Deaths"" will focus on 14 safety standards that were chosen because violations related to each have been cited as contributing to at least five mining accidents and at least five deaths during the 10-year period of Jan. 1, 2001, to Dec. 31, 2010. ""The goal of this phase of 'Rules to Live By' is to reduce numbers of deaths and injuries from the targeted standards by having mine operators identify and correct all hazardous conditions, direct MSHA enforcement toward confirming that violations related to these conditions are not present at mines, and ensure miners are better trained to recognize and avoid these particular hazards,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. From 2001 through 2010, 609 miners lost their lives in workplace accidents. Violations associated with eight coal standards contributed to 58 deaths during this period, while violations associated with six metal and nonmetal standards contributed to 47 deaths. The coal standards are as follows: 75.362(a)(1) – on-shift examination 77.404(a) – machinery and equipment; operation and maintenance 77.405(b) – performing work from a raised position; safeguards 77.1000 – highwalls, pits and spoil banks; plans 77.1605(b) – loading and haulage equipment; installations 77.1606(a) – loading and haulage equipment; inspection and maintenance 77.1607(b) – loading and haulage equipment; operation 77.1713(a) – daily inspection of surface coal mine; certified person; reports of inspection The metal and nonmetal standards are as follows: 46.7(a) – new task training 56.3130 – wall, bank and slope stability 56.3200 – correction of hazardous conditions 56.15020 – life jackets and belts 56.14100(b) – safety defects; examination, correction and records 57.14100(b) – safety defects; examination, correction and records Beginning April 1, MSHA will focus more attention on these 14 standards with enhanced enforcement efforts, increased scrutiny for related violations, and instructions to inspectors to more carefully evaluate gravity and negligence – consistent with the seriousness of the violation – when citing violations that cause or contribute to mining fatalities. MSHA inspectors will receive online training to promote consistency in enforcement activity across the agency. As with the first two phases of ""Rules to Live By,"" online training will be available to the mining industry and the public on MSHA's website, and MSHA will provide operators with program and resource information. The agency also will reach out to engage miners and their representatives during the course of MSHA inspections to disseminate appropriate compliance assistance materials – including engineering suggestions, safety target materials packages and other resources – so that they have the appropriate information to address and eliminate workplace hazards. ""In 2011, mining deaths fell to the second lowest annual total on record – a testament to the commitment of miners, mine operators, miners' representatives, labor and industry organizations, state agencies and grantees, members of the mining community and MSHA,"" said Main. ""While the mining community achieved near-record low numbers of mining deaths in the United States and has seen a significant decline in fatal mining accidents during the past 10 years, too many miners still lose their lives in preventable accidents. The loss of even one miner causes devastation and pain to the victim's family, friends and co-workers. ""Compliance with safety and health standards is the responsibility of mine operators, with the assistance of miners. Ultimately, all of us must focus on why these accidents happen and how to prevent them,"" he added. The first phase of ""Rules to Live By"" began in February 2010.

Women are still paid less on average than their male counterparts for doing comparable jobs, and the discrepancy is even greater for minority women. Over the course of a lifetime, this ""pay gap"" results in lost wages, reduced pensions and diminished Social Security benefits. ""Women make up nearly half of the U.S. labor force and play a vital role in the nation's economy,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""While progress has been made in recent decades, the pay gap continues to disadvantage many women, with consequences not only for them, but for their families and the economy as a whole."" The Equal Pay App Challenge calls on developers to use publicly available data and resources to create innovative, easy-to-use apps that educate users about the pay gap and provide tools to combat it. The apps should improve the accessibility of pay data broken down by gender, race and ethnicity, and provide coaching on early career pay, pay negotiation or career mentorship. More information, including a complete list of the contest's rules and requirements, is available at http://www.challenge.gov/labor. ""Today's employers and employees are more resourceful and technologically savvy than ever before, but too many remain unaware of how the pay gap affects them,"" said White House Chief Technology Officer Aneesh Chopra. ""By encouraging developers to help us solve this problem, we're leveraging the unique ability of the federal government to provide mountains of valuable data as well as the innovation power of the private sector."" Applications that best satisfy the criteria for the challenge will be eligible to receive one of eight prizes, including scholarships to attend an eight-week immersive program on digital product innovation and entrepreneurship hosted by General Assembly, a campus for technology, design and entrepreneurship. The challenge will be open for submissions from Jan. 31 until March 31. Judges will announce the winners in connection with Equal Pay Day in April at http://www.challenge.gov . To help facilitate this and similar challenges, the Labor Department last year launched http://developer.dol.gov , a website that helps software developers incorporate department data into online and mobile applications through published application program interfaces and software development kits.

The rule will be effective on March 1. ""Many of America's seniors contribute richly to their communities through all forms of service,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Employment and Training Jane Oates. ""Incorporating this service into our program helps us better understand the contributions our seniors make."" The Senior Community Service Employment Program authorized by Title V of the Older Americans Act is the only federally-sponsored employment and training program targeted specifically to unemployed, low-income seniors. The program has dual goals of promoting community service and helping SCSEP participants achieve economic self-sufficiency by guiding them into unsubsidized employment, where appropriate. The new indicator incorporated in the final rule will allow the department to better fulfill both goals by gathering more specific information about the breadth and depth of participation in SCSEP, and the positive impact that SCSEP has both on the lives of participants and the community. The indicator will capture data on several aspects of the volunteer work, including whether a participant had been performing volunteer work before involvement in the SCSEP program, the type of work, the setting in which the work is performed and the number of volunteer hours per week. The final rule was prepared after further reflection upon comments received during an earlier SCSEP final rule notice and comment period in 2010; a number of commenters had highlighted the need to give greater weight to community service and volunteer work in the mix of SCSEP measures. A need to reinforce the dual purposes of SCSEP therefore served as the foundation for this final rule, and the comments received at the notice stage of this rulemaking were also very supportive of the new measure.

The J.M. Slate Mill performs stone cutting and sawing operations in leased mill space on the grounds of the Warren Switch, which places the mill under MSHA's jurisdiction and makes it subject to periodic federal safety and health inspections. When MSHA personnel attempted an inspection in August 2011, one of the mill's operators, John McFarren, repeatedly refused them entry and to provide information, and otherwise impeded the inspection process. On Dec. 13, the department filed a motion with the U.S. District Court for the District of Vermont in Burlington seeking an injunction against J.M. Slate, John McFarren, John McClure, Jesse Tyrell and unnamed partners to prevent them from refusing entry to inspectors, refusing to provide requested documents and information, and otherwise interfering with MSHA inspectors performing their duties under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. U.S. District Judge William K. Sessions III granted the injunction on Jan. 4. Defendant McClure, doing business as the mill's current operator, Dream Team Slate, agreed to the order enjoining him from interfering with MSHA inspections. Defendants McFarren and Tyrell, who represented in open court that they are no longer operating the mill, are similarly enjoined should they take any actions together with McClure to interfere with inspections. ""The law clearly states that MSHA has the right to inspect and gather information to determine whether or not there are hazardous conditions that could inflict injury or illness upon the individuals working in a covered operation,"" said Michael Felsen, the department's regional solicitor of labor for New England.

Solis today announced that the U.S. Department of Labor is issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking to implement new statutory amendments to the Family and Medical Leave Act that would expand military family leave provisions and incorporate a special eligibility provision for airline flight crew employees. The FMLA, enacted in 1993, entitles eligible employees of covered employers to take unpaid, job-protected leave for specified family and medical reasons. ""Keeping the basic promise of America alive means ensuring that workers, from our servicemen and servicewomen who keep us safe at home to the flight crews who keep us safe in the skies, have the resources, support and opportunities they need and have rightfully earned,"" said Secretary Solis. ""The proposed revisions announced today are an important step toward keeping that promise."" The proposed language would extend the entitlement of military caregiver leave to family members of veterans for up to five years after leaving the military. At this time, the law only covers family members of ""currently serving"" service members. Additionally, the proposal expands the military family leave provisions of the FMLA by extending qualifying exigency leave to employees whose family members serve in the regular armed forces. Currently, the law only covers families of National Guard members and reservists. For airline flight crew employees, the proposed revision makes the benefits of the FMLA more accessible. It would add a special hours of service eligibility requirement for them and specific provisions for calculating the amount of FMLA leave used that better take into account the unique — and often difficult to track — hours worked by crew members.

Solis issued the following statement regarding the Bureau of Labor Statistics report released today on union members in 2011: ""Today the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced that, in 2011, the unionization rate of employed wage and salary workers was 11.8 percent, essentially unchanged from 11.9 percent in 2010. Among private sector employees, the rate remained at 6.9 percent. ""The data also show that among full-time wage and salary workers, the median weekly earnings of union members were $938, compared to $729 for nonunion workers. Union women earned median weekly earnings of $879, an amount 34.6 percent higher than their nonunion counterparts, who earned just $653 by comparison. ""Prior reporting shows that union members have greater access to health care, retirement and leave benefits. Today's numbers make it clear that union jobs are critical to a strong economy. And a strong economy depends on a strong and growing middle class. ""Ensuring that all people have a voice at work and protecting their right to organize and bargain collectively are essential for an America that's built to last, where everyone gets a fair shot, everyone pays his or her fair share and everyone plays by the same rules."""

"January 26, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20120126,"Administrative law judge orders Newport, Del.-based Daisy Construction to pay $59,000 for willful trenching violations","NEWPORT , Del. – An administrative law judge with the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission has found that Newport-based Daisy Construction willfully violated the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration's trenching standards, and ordered the company to pay $59,000 in penalties. Dennis L. Phillips' decision resolves litigation that followed citations issued by OSHA based on a 2010 investigation. Two willful violations were failing to provide employees working in a trench with an adequate protection system to prevent cave-ins and protect employees by removing them from the unprotected trench. One serious violation was failing to instruct employees on how to recognize and avoid unsafe conditions. The company contested the citations, and the case was litigated before the commission. The decision upholds the willful and serious classifications of the violations, and it could become a final order of the commission on or about Feb. 13 unless a petition for appeal is filed. ""This decision is a victory for excavation workers who regularly face dangerous trenching conditions, and underscores the Labor Department's commitment to pursue workplace safety and health violators to the full extent of the law,"" said Robert Kulick, OSHA's acting regional administrator in Philadelphia. ""Employers have a legal obligation to ensure that proper precautions are taken to prevent cave-ins."" A willful violation is one committed with intentional knowing or voluntary disregard for the law's requirements, or with plain indifference to worker safety and health. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known. Detailed information on excavation hazards and safeguards is available on OSHA's website at http://63.234.227.130/SLTC/trenchingexcavation/ (link is external) . To ask questions, obtain compliance assistance, file a complaint, or report workplace hospitalizations, fatalities or situations posing imminent danger to workers, the public should call OSHA's toll-free hotline at 800-321-OSHA (6742) or the agency's Wilmington Area Office at 302-573-6518. Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. OSHA's role is to ensure these conditions for America's working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education and assistance.

"January 25, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20120125,MSHA News Brief: MSHA announces results of December impact inspections [2011],"ARLINGTON, Va. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration today announced that federal inspectors issued 321 citations and orders during special impact inspections conducted at 10 coal mines and three metal/nonmetal mines last month. The coal mines were issued 174 citations and 19 orders, while the metal/nonmetal operations were issued 112 citations and 16 orders. These inspections, which began in force in April 2010 following the explosion at the Upper Big Branch Mine, involve mines that merit increased agency attention and enforcement due to their poor compliance history or particular compliance concerns, including high numbers of violations or closure orders; frequent hazard complaints or hotline calls; plan compliance issues; inadequate workplace examinations; a high number of accidents, injuries or illnesses; fatalities; and adverse conditions such as increased methane liberation, faulty roof conditions and inadequate ventilation. One of MSHA's most recent inspections was conducted during the night shift between Dec. 8 and 9 at Coal Creek Mining LLC's No. 2 Mine in Floyd County, Ky. The agency's team secured and monitored the phones during the inspection and issued 32 citations and 12 orders, which subsequently shut down the mine. MSHA issued an imminent danger order when an inspector observed a coal pile, 5 feet high and 10 feet in diameter, on fire approximately 23 feet from an explosives storage magazine outside the mine. Additionally, the storage magazine, which contained two cases of explosives, had not been secured against unauthorized entry. A clearly identified key was lying on top of the magazine. Furthermore, a 5-gallon oil bucket full of burning coal and other materials was discovered near the intake portals of the mine. Other violations include allowing accumulations of loose coal (up to 30 inches in depth) beneath conveyor belts and drives as well as in the presence of ignition sources such as drive rollers and bottom belt rollers. Inadequate rock dusting was found at several locations in the mine. The operator also allowed the accumulation of float coal dust on top of previously rock-dusted surfaces throughout the belt entry and adjacent crosscuts. Float coal dust was present on the mine floor, roof and ribs, as well as on the conveyor belt structure and mining equipment. An unwarrantable failure order was issued for failing to follow the approved ventilation plan that required the operator to keep roadways in the mine damp to suppress dust. Fine, powdery dust 2-4 inches deep was present along the entire length of the main roadway entry and section-haulage road entries. More unwarrantable failure orders were issued for inadequate workplace hazard examinations, including on-shift conveyor belt examinations, weekly return air course examinations and weekly electrical equipment examinations. Following the December impact inspection, the operator was issued two 104(b) orders for failing to completely correct and abate hazards within the required time frame. ""It is troubling that, after all this time, MSHA inspectors continue to find such serious hazards and some mine operators allow such conditions to exist,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""We will continue to use all the enforcement tools at our disposal to combat noncompliance."" As a second example from last month, MSHA conducted an impact inspection Dec. 16-23 at Hecla Limited's Lucky Friday Mine in Shoshone County, Idaho. Inspectors issued 59 citations and 15 orders to Hecla Ltd. and 22 citations to Cementation USA Inc., an independent contractor. Among the violations cited was a repeated failure to maintain established ground support systems throughout the mine. In addition, ground support fixtures in several areas had not been installed or torqued properly; shafts had not been systematically inspected, tested and maintained, and steel structures in the shaft were not kept clean of hazardous materials; multiple areas of the mine had not been provided with two separate escapeways; explosives magazines had not been constructed and located to protect miners from the risk of unintended explosions; underground shop doors were improperly constructed to ensure fire protection; elevated walkways in multiple areas were not provided with substantially constructed handrails; and travel areas were not kept clean and orderly, resulting in slip, trip and fall hazards. Two miners died at Lucky Friday Mine in 2011. In December, seven miners were trapped underground when a roof fall occurred, three of whom required hospitalization. Since April 2010, MSHA has conducted 387 impact inspections, which have resulted in a total of 6,927 citations, 702 orders and 24 safeguards.

"January 25, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20120125,"US Labor Department obtains court-appointed independent  fiduciary for 401(k) plan of defunct Westerly, RI, company","PROVIDENCE, R.I. – The U.S. Department of Labor has obtained a court judgment and order appointing an independent fiduciary to manage the 401(k) plan of defunct BlueSky Brands Inc. of Westerly, R.I. The judgment and order resolve a lawsuit filed by the Labor Department against the company for violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Under the judgment and order, the court appointed Northeast Retirement Services Inc. of Woburn, Mass., to serve as the independent fiduciary of the BlueSky Brands Inc. 401(k) Savings Plan. The independent fiduciary has the authority to manage the plan, distribute its assets to the plan’s participants and beneficiaries, and terminate the plan. The judgment was entered in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island. “It’s doubly unfortunate when the closure of a company results in workers both losing their jobs and access to the retirement benefits they have earned,” said Edward Maloney, acting regional director of the Labor Department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration in Boston, Mass. “We took this legal action to ensure that the plan is properly managed so that its participants can finally gain access to their retirement assets.” BlueSky Brands Inc. sponsored the 401(k) plan to provide retirement benefits to the plan participants. Prior to ceasing operations in March 2008, the company failed to take steps to ensure the ongoing prudent administration of the plan, according to the Labor Department’s suit. As a result, former employees of the company have been unable to access their 401(k) accounts. Under ERISA, plans must be managed by fiduciaries. In the absence of a plan fiduciary, participants and beneficiaries cannot obtain plan information, make investments or collect retirement benefits. As of Aug. 31, 2010, the plan had 77 participants and assets totaling $1,055,136.89, the latest data available. Fidelity Investments is the custodian of all of the plan’s assets and will not release those assets without the authorization of a plan fiduciary. This suit resulted from an investigation conducted by EBSA’s Boston Regional Office. The case was litigated by the Labor Department’s regional solicitor in Boston. Employers and workers can contact EBSA’s Boston office at 617-565-9600 or toll-free at 866-444-3272 for help with any problems relating to private sector pension and health plans.

Employees 401(k) Plan. The default judgment, entered in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan in Detroit, allows the plan’s known assets of $299,598.84 to be distributed to its 23 participants as required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The retirement plan was abandoned upon the deaths of Timothy Russell and William Dornbrock, the former owners of Intelec Inc. and trustees of the plan. Intelec Inc. ceased doing business in July 2009 and was automatically dissolved by Michigan’s secretary of state. The judgment appoints AMI Benefit Plan Administrators Inc. as an independent fiduciary to terminate the plan and distribute its assets to participants and beneficiaries. “We are pleased that workers will now have access to their hard-earned retirement savings,” said L. Joe Rivers, director of the Cincinnati Regional Office of the department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration. “The Labor Department is committed to helping workers obtain their rightful benefits so they can continue to provide for themselves and their families during their retirement.” The department’s legal action resulted from an investigation by EBSA’s Cincinnati office.

The lawsuit follows an investigation by the department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration that found employees’ contributions to the 401(k) plan had been commingled with the general assets of the company, a violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina, Charlotte Division, the suit alleges that employee contributions withheld between Feb. 21, 2007, and April 30, 2009, were never forwarded to the plan. The contributions were used for company purposes and obligations rather than for the exclusive benefit of the plan and its participants. “Employees contribute to their retirement plans with the expectation that the funds will be there when needed,” said Isabel Colon, director of EBSA’s regional office in Atlanta. “The Labor Department will not tolerate the diversion of these funds for other uses.” The department is asking the court to order Garrison to restore all losses, including interest or lost opportunity costs, to the plan, and that his individual plan account be set off against the amount of losses to all participants. The department also is asking that Garrison be permanently barred from serving as fiduciary, administrator, officer, trustee, custodian, agent, employee or representative of any employee benefit plan subject to ERISA. Finally, the department asks that a successor fiduciary be appointed to oversee the plan’s assets. As of Dec. 31, 2009, the plan had approximately 33 participants and assets totaling $101,687, the latest data available. Garrison Enterprises specializes in the development of Web-based solutions for government and is headquartered in Charlotte. This case was investigated by EBSA’s Atlanta Regional Office. It is being litigated by the Labor Department’s Regional Office of the Solicitor in Atlanta. Employers and workers can contact EBSA’s Atlanta office at 404-302-3900 or toll-free at 866-444-3272 for help with problems relating to private sector retirement and health plans.

"January 18, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20120118,US Department of Labor provides grant increment to continue flood recovery efforts in southeastern Ohio,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor today announced a $5 million National Emergency Grant increment to continue providing temporary jobs for eligible dislocated workers. They will assist with cleanup and recovery efforts following severe storms and floods in April and May 2011 that affected southeastern Ohio. ""Ohio continues to recover from the damage caused by severe storms and floods in the spring of 2011,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""The additional federal funding announced today will help prevent future flooding in the Appalachian region while continuing to provide temporary work for those in need of employment."" On July 13, 2011, the Federal Emergency Management Agency declared 21 Ohio counties eligible for FEMA's Public Assistance Program. These funds will serve 15 of those counties: Athens, Belmont, Gallia, Guernsey, Hocking, Jackson, Jefferson, Lawrence, Meigs, Monroe, Morgan, Ross, Scioto, Vinton and Washington. More information on designated disaster areas in Ohio is available from FEMA at http://www.fema.gov/news/eventcounties.fema?id=15052. On Aug. 8, the Labor Department awarded a National Emergency Grant of $16,233,360 to the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services, with $3.5 million released initially. The increment announced today brings the total funds awarded to date under the grant to $8.5 million. Additional funding up to the amount approved will be made available as the state demonstrates a continued need for assistance. National Emergency Grants are part of the secretary of labor's discretionary fund and are awarded based on a state's ability to meet specific guidelines.

"January 18, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20120118,US Labor Department files complaint to require DeMoulas Super Markets to address hazards at Market Basket stores in Massachusetts and New Hampshire,"Employees of New England grocery chain exposed to fall and laceration dangers BOSTON – The U.S. Department of Labor's regional solicitor's office in Boston has filed a complaint against DeMoulas Super Markets Inc., doing business as Market Basket, with the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. The complaint asks the commission to order the Tewksbury, Mass.-based chain to comply with the department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration's safety standards designed to protect employees from fall and laceration hazards at the employer's more than 60 stores in Massachusetts and New Hampshire. This request for enterprisewide relief is based upon hazards OSHA found during inspections of various DeMoulas stores, including the agency's most recent inspections at Market Basket stores in Rindge and Concord, N.H. Those inspections resulted in citations and proposed OSHA fines totaling $589,200, which DeMoulas has contested to the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. ""Hazardous conditions at multiple locations that expose employees to serious injuries demand a swift and comprehensive corrective response at the corporate level,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for OSHA Dr. David Michaels. ""OSHA insists that this employer completely and effectively eliminate the hazards it never should have allowed to exist in the first place."" The department's complaint alleges that employees at multiple Market Basket stores were exposed or likely to be exposed to fall hazards from unguarded, open-sided work and storage areas, including storage lofts and atop produce coolers and freezers. An employee of the Market Basket store in Rindge was seriously injured in April 2011 when he fell 11 feet onto a concrete floor from an inadequately guarded storage mezzanine, and an employee at a Billerica, Mass., store was seriously injured under similar conditions in 2007. The company also allegedly failed to protect employees in produce, deli and bakery departments against laceration hazards from knives and cutting instruments by not conducting job hazard analyses that would have identified the need for hand protection, and by not providing such hand protection to workers exposed to the hazards. In 2006, after being cited by OSHA, the company agreed to complete job hazard analyses in all stores but failed to do so. Between 2008 and 2011, employees at the Rindge and Concord stores sustained at least 40 recorded hand lacerations. ""Worker safety is not optional, and it cannot be addressed in a piecemeal fashion. It must be addressed across the board,"" said Michaels. ""This employer has the responsibility to safeguard all its employees at all its locations, something it has failed to do."" DeMoulas Super Markets has 20 days from receipt of the complaint to file an answer. Details of OSHA's inspections of the Rindge and Concord stores and copies of the citations can be found at http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=NEWS_RELEASES&p_id=20880 . This complaint filed with the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission marks the second such time that the department has expressly sought enterprisewide relief from an employer. The first time was against the U.S. Postal Service in July 2010 for correction of electrical work safety violations at 350 postal facilities throughout the nation. That matter is pending. Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. OSHA's role is to ensure these conditions for America's working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education and assistance.

The investigation, conducted by the Wage and Hour Division's San Antonio District Office, found that University Health System had denied an employee's request for intermittent leave related to a serious chronic health condition. The employer instead insisted that the leave be taken continuously — even though the worker was capable of performing the job with intermittent leave. As a result, the employee used more leave than was medically necessary, resulting in lost wages over a three-month period. ""The Family and Medical Leave Act allows for workplace flexibility by giving an eligible employee the right to take a total of 12 workweeks of unpaid, job-protected leave during any 12-month period to address a serious health condition that makes him or her unable to perform the essential functions of the job,"" said Cynthia Watson, regional administrator for the Wage and Hour Division in the Southwest. ""Leave may be taken all at once, or on an intermittent basis, as the condition requires. The Labor Department is committed to ensuring worker protections guaranteed by federal law, as well as to educating employers and holding them responsible for compliance."" In addition to paying back wages, University Health System agreed to maintain future compliance with the FMLA, ensure that managers receive FMLA training, and notify its employees of their rights and responsibilities under the act. The Bexar County Hospital District is the third-largest public health system in Texas with about 5,000 employees and 700 resident physicians. The FMLA's protections include continuation during leave of group health insurance coverage under the same terms and conditions as if the employee had not taken leave. Information about the FMLA is available on the Wage and Hour Division's website at http://www.dol.gov/whd/fmla/index.htm .

"January 17, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20120117,"US Department of Labors OSHA orders AirTran Airways to reinstate pilot, pay more than $1 million in back wages and damages","OSHA found airline violated whistleblower protection provision of AIR21 ORLANDO, Fla. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration has ordered AirTran Airways, a subsidiary of Dallas, Texas-based Southwest Airlines Co., to reinstate a former pilot who was fired after reporting numerous mechanical concerns. The agency also has ordered that the pilot be paid more than $1 million in back wages plus interest and compensatory damages. An investigation by OSHA's Whistleblower Protection Program found reasonable cause to believe that the termination was an act of retaliation in violation of the whistleblower provision of the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century, known as AIR21. ""Airline workers must be free to raise safety and security concerns, and companies that diminish those rights through intimidation or retaliation must be held accountable,"" said OSHA Assistant Secretary Dr. David Michaels. ""Airline safety is of vital importance, not only to the workers, but to the millions of Americans who use our airways."" The pilot's complaint alleged that the airline removed him from flight status on Aug. 23, 2007, pending an investigative hearing regarding a sudden spike in the pilot's mechanical malfunction reports, or PIREPS. The airline held an internal investigative hearing on Sept. 6, 2007, that lasted 17 minutes. Seven days later, the airline terminated the pilot's employment, claiming that he did not satisfactorily answer a question regarding the spike in reports. OSHA found that the pilot did not refuse to answer any questions during the hearing, answers to questions were appropriate, and the action taken by the airline was retaliatory. ""Retaliating against a pilot for reporting mechanical malfunctions is not consistent with a company that values the safety of its workers and customers,"" added Michaels. ""Whistleblower laws are designed to protect workers' rights to speak out when they have safety concerns, and the Labor Department will vigilantly protect and defend those fundamental rights."" Either party to the case can file an appeal with the Labor Department's Office of Administrative Law Judges, but such an appeal does not stay the preliminary reinstatement order. AirTran Airways is a subsidiary of AirTran Holdings Inc. with headquarters in Orlando. On May 2, 2011, Southwest Airlines completed the acquisition of AirTran Holdings Inc. and now operates AirTran Airways as a wholly-owned subsidiary. OSHA enforces the whistleblower provision of AIR21, as well as 20 other statutes protecting employees who report violations of various securities, trucking, workplace health and safety, nuclear, pipeline, environmental, rail, maritime, health care, consumer product and food safety laws. Employees who believe that they have been retaliated against for engaging in protected conduct may file a complaint with the secretary of labor for an investigation by OSHA's Whistleblower Protection Program. Detailed information on employee whistleblower rights is available online at http://www.whistleblowers.gov . To ask questions, obtain compliance assistance, file a complaint, or report workplace hospitalizations, fatalities or situations posing imminent danger to workers, the public should call OSHA's toll-free hotline at 800-321-OSHA (6742), the agency's Atlanta Regional Office at 678-237-0400 or its Tampa Area Office at 813-626-1177.

"January 12, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20120112-0,Secretary of labor announces grant competition to help former offenders gain career skills and rejoin community life,"NEWPORT NEWS, Va. – Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis today announced the availability of $20.6 million in grant funds to assist adult former offenders who are returning to their communities after serving time in justice facilities. The U.S. Department of Labor expects to award 17 grants of approximately $1.21 million each to organizations that will provide these individuals with employment-focused services and support. ""By supporting these employment training programs, we are fulfilling a core promise of our justice system: Those who do wrong and serve their time deserve a second chance to make a positive contribution to their families and their communities,"" said Secretary Solis. ""Ultimately, these investments are turning 'tax takers' into 'tax payers,' and helping to relieve a major economic strain on state and local budgets, while also helping individuals get back on their feet and enhancing community stability."" Grantees will provide job training and employment preparation assistance, mentoring and connections to support services such as housing, substance abuse programs and mental health treatment. These grants represent the fifth generation of the Reintegration of Ex-Offenders-Adult Program, which previously was called the Prisoner Re-entry Initiative. Eligible applicants for the grants include nonprofit organizations that are located in or have existing staff in the high-poverty, high-crime communities they propose to serve. Program participants will be individuals ages 18 and older who have been convicted of crimes as adults under federal or state law, but never of a sex-related offense, with the exception of prostitution. Complete eligibility criteria are included in the solicitation for grant applications. Each year, approximately 700,000 inmates are released from state and federal prisons, and return to their communities and families. Without assistance to make a successful transition, the majority of former offenders return to criminal activity. In order to successfully reintegrate into their communities, it is essential that these individuals have the skills and support necessary to compete for and obtain jobs. A notice of the grants solicitation will be published in the Jan. 13 edition of the Federal Register. To view a copy online, visit http://www.doleta.gov/grants/find_grants.cfm .

"January 12, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/owcp/owcp20120112,US Department of Labor notifies workers of 17 facilities associated with Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act about potential eligibility under EEOICPA,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Labor is notifying former workers of 17 facilities associated with the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act about compensation and medical benefits potentially available to them under the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act, which is administered by the department's Division of Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation. Survivors of qualified workers also may be entitled to benefits. Former employees may be eligible if they worked at any of the facilities during a period of covered U.S. Department of Energy-funded environmental remediation efforts. Additionally, three facilities already covered under the EEOICPA now have expanded periods of eligibility. On Dec. 15, 2010, DEEOIC determined that the Uranium Mill at Shiprock, N.M., was a covered DOE facility for the purposes of the EEOICPA. Given that Uranium Mill at Shiprock was only one of the facilities associated with the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act, DEEOIC conducted a review considering whether additional facilities met the statutory definition of a covered DOE facility under the EEOICPA. Based on that review, DEEOIC determined that the above-mentioned facilities meet the definition. On July 31, 2001, the Labor Department began administering Part B of the EEOICPA. Part B covers current and former workers who have been diagnosed with cancer, beryllium disease or silicosis, and whose illness was caused by exposure to radiation, beryllium or silica while working directly for DOE, that department's contractors or subcontractors, a designated Atomic Weapons Employer or a beryllium vendor. Part E, created by an amendment to the EEOICPA on Oct. 28, 2004, provides federal compensation and medical benefits to DOE contractors and subcontractors who worked at covered facilities and sustained an illness as a result of exposure to toxic substances. The EEOICPA also provides additional compensation for uranium workers who worked at facilities covered by the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, which is administered by the U.S. Department of Justice. To assist individuals regardless of where they live, the department has 11 stationary resource centers located throughout the country. These resource centers provide an initial point-of-contact for individuals interested in filing a claim under EEOICPA, and staff provide both in-person and telephone-based assistance. For additional information about how to file a claim under EEOICPA, call toll-free at 866-888-3322 or visit the DEEOIC's website at http://www.dol.gov/owcp/energy/ .

"January 12, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ofccp/ofccp20120112,US Labor Department settles charges of racial discrimination with Houston-based defense contractor JacintoPort,"HOUSTON — The U.S. Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs today announced that government contractor JacintoPort International LLC has agreed to settle allegations of hiring discrimination on the basis of race involving 48 African-American and 21 Caucasian job applicants who were rejected for longshoreman positions at the company's cargo facility in Houston. ""In this day and age, it is shocking that any company would allow race to be a factor in determining who gets hired,"" said OFCCP Director Patricia A. Shiu. ""This settlement should put all federal contractors on notice that, in the Obama administration, we will be persistent when it comes to rooting out workplace discrimination and will vigilantly monitor employers who violate the law until they get it right."" OFCCP previously cited JacintoPort for violating requirements of Executive Order 11246 by failing to implement an applicant tracking system for new hires, and to develop and execute action-oriented programs to recruit women and African-Americans. That matter was settled on June 6, 2006, with a conciliation document in which JacintoPort agreed to correct the violations and produce semiannual reports on the company's progress in employing women and minorities. In reviewing those progress reports, OFCCP investigators found that the company was giving preferential treatment to Latino applicants and systematically discriminating against African-Americans and Caucasians seeking longshoreman jobs. Under the terms of the latest conciliation agreement, JacintoPort will pay $219,000 in back wages and interest to the affected individuals, and make 17 job offers to members of the original class as longshoreman positions become available. In addition, JacintoPort has agreed to undertake extensive self-monitoring measures to ensure that all hiring practices fully comply with the law, including record-keeping requirements. JacintoPort, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Shawnee Mission, Kan.-based Seaboard Corp., currently holds more than $1.2 million in contracts to store and transport cargo for the Defense Commissary Agency. In addition to Executive Order 11246, OFCCP enforces Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974. As amended, these three laws require those who do business with the federal government, both contractors and subcontractors, to follow the fair and reasonable standard that they not discriminate in employment on the basis of sex, race, color, religion, national origin, disability or status as a protected veteran.

The court has ordered the defendants to restore plan losses and interest totaling $65,244 and undertake all necessary actions to terminate the plan and implement distributions and rollovers once plan losses have been paid. Additionally, the defendants will be permanently barred from serving as fiduciaries to any plan governed by ERISA in the future and pay the full penalty for violations.

The order and judgment, entered in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio in Cleveland, resolve a lawsuit filed by the department alleging violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. “We are pleased that North Coast Wood Products workers will have their hard-earned retirement money put back into their accounts with interest.

Fishleigh improperly transferred the total plan assets of $96,837.63 belonging to 11 plan participants to his son Stephen between July 2006 and July 2009. Lost interest totaling $17,339.23 also is owed to the participants. The judgment also requires Fishleigh to pay $2,941.95 to cover the fees and costs of an independent fiduciary appointed by the court to oversee the distribution of plan assets to affected participants and terminate the plan. Additionally, Fishleigh has been permanently barred from serving as a fiduciary or service provider to any employee benefit plan covered by ERISA.

"January 6, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20120106,Statement by Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis on December employment numbers,"WASHINGTON – Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis issued the following statement on the December 2011 Employment Situation report released today: ""Our nation's strengthening labor market posted broad-based growth in the month of December. Nonfarm payroll employment added 200,000 jobs, exceeding expectations, and the unemployment rate fell to 8.5 percent, its lowest level in nearly three years. ""Month by month, industry by industry, and state by state, America's labor market grew stronger in 2011. We're now seeing sustained job growth across almost every industry. We created nearly 2 million private sector jobs in 2011, and the unemployment rate fell in 45 states and the District of Columbia last year. Additionally, the number of mass layoffs continued to decline, with 14 of 19 industries reporting a decrease in layoffs over the year. ""In December, job creation in the transportation industry rose sharply, and we saw significant employment gains in retail trade, manufacturing, health care, and leisure and hospitality. Initial Unemployment Insurance claims have been well below 400,000 for the past month, the first time this has happened since June 2008. ""We've now created more than 3.2 million jobs over 22 consecutive months of private sector growth. But our hard-won progress cannot be compromised. Congress wisely extended Unemployment Insurance benefits and the payroll tax cut for two months, but if we're going to see our economy reach a self-sustaining path to durable and long-term economic growth, Congress will need to extend both programs for at least a full year.

Aguilar today signed an alliance agreement to advance President Obama's executive order to increase the hiring of people with disabilities by federal agencies. ""Today's alliance is an opportunity for ODEP and CBP to demonstrate disability employment practices that will not only result in increased hires at CBP but easily can be replicated by other federal agencies seeking to fulfill the requirements of their executive order plans,"" said Martinez. The Labor Department's Office of Disability Employment Policy's Alliance Initiative, begun in 2006, enables organizations committed to improving disability workplace practices to work with ODEP to develop and implement model policies and initiatives that increase recruiting, hiring, advancing and retaining employees with disabilities. Working together, ODEP and CBP will promote effective strategies and practices. ""CBP is proud to be the first federal agency to partner with the Department of Labor on an alliance to advance opportunities for workers with disabilities,"" said Aguilar. ""By signing this alliance agreement, CBP commits to recruit, hire, advance and retain employees with disabilities more effectively than ever before."" CBP is one of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's largest and most complex components, with a mission of keeping terrorists and their weapons out of the U.S. It also has a responsibility for securing and facilitating trade and travel while enforcing hundreds of U.S. regulations, including immigration and drug laws. ODEP's mission is to provide national leadership by developing and influencing disability employment-related policies aimed at increasing the employment of people with disabilities. In addition to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, ODEP has alliances with the Partnership for Public Service, the Society for Human Resource Management, the U.S. Business Leadership Network, the HSC Foundation and the National Association of Governors' Committees on People with Disabilities."

"January 5, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20120105,MSHA releases preliminary fatality data for 2011,"ARLINGTON, Va. – Preliminary data from the U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration released today reveal that 37 miners died in work-related accidents at the nation's mines in 2011. There were 21 coal mining and 16 metal/nonmetal mining fatalities last year, compared with 48 and 23, respectively, in 2010, making 2011 the year with the second-lowest number of mining deaths since statistics were first recorded in 1910. Of the 37 fatalities reported, 12 occurred at surface coal mines, 11 at surface metal/nonmetal mines, nine at underground coal mines and five at underground metal/nonmetal mines. Nine workers died in accidents involving machinery – six in coal mines and three in metal/nonmetal mines – making it the leading cause of fatal mining accidents. Kentucky had the most mining deaths – eight – in 2011, followed by West Virginia with six and Ohio with three. All but one of those deaths occurred in coal mines. Several of the larger coal-producing states, including Alabama, Pennsylvania, Illinois and Utah, experienced zero mine fatalities last year. ""Mining deaths are preventable,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""The year that the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 passed, 273 miners died and, since that time, fatality numbers have steadily declined. In order to prevent mine deaths, operators must have in place effective safety and health management programs that are constantly evaluated, find-and-fix programs to identify and eliminate mine hazards, and training for all mining personnel."" MSHA has undertaken a number of measures to prevent mining deaths: increased surveillance and strategic enforcement through impact inspections at mines with troubling compliance histories; enhanced pattern of violations actions; special initiatives such as ""Rules to Live By,"" which focuses attention on the most common causes of mining deaths; and outreach efforts such as ""Safety Pro in a Box,"" which provides guidance to the metal/nonmetal mining industry on best practices and compliance responsibilities. ""It takes the entire mining community to continue to reach new milestones in health and safety,"" said Main. ""While fewer miners are dying on the job, we can never alter our focus because, as we know, things can change in a moment. Miners need the reassurance that they will return home safe and healthy after each shift.""

"January 5, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/owcp/owcp20120105,US Labor Department announces final rule defining recreational vessels under Longshore and Harbor Workers Compensation Act,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Labor's Office of Workers' Compensation Programs has issued a final rule implementing the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act's exclusion for recreational vessel workers. The rule defines what constitutes a ""recreational vessel"" when applying the exclusion. The LHWCA provides workers (or their survivors in the case of death) compensation for injuries related to maritime employment on the navigable waters of the United States or adjoining areas. Prior to 2009, workers who repaired or dismantled recreational vessels fewer than 65 feet in length were excluded from coverage if they were covered by a state workers' compensation program. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 expanded this exclusion by eliminating the 65-foot limitation; post-amendment, workers who repair recreational vessels of any length or dismantle them for repair are excluded from LHWCA coverage if they are covered under a state workers' compensation law. The final rule adopts several recommendations made by members of the public who commented on a notice of proposed rulemaking issued Aug. 17, 2010. The final rule generally uses the U.S. Coast Guard's standards for defining a recreational vessel. The Labor Department has added two provisions to make it easier to apply these standards in the LHWCA context. First, a manufacturer or builder may determine whether a vessel is recreational within the meaning of the regulation based on the vessel's design rather than on its end use. Second, noncommercial vessels that are recreational by design and owned or chartered by the federal or a state government fall within the recreational vessel definition. The rule can be viewed on the Federal Register's website at http://federalregister.gov/a/2011-32880 . Additional information is available on OWCP's website at http://www.dol.gov/owcp/dlhwc/lsnewregulation.htm . The Office of Workers' Compensation Programs administers several disability benefit programs that cover longshore and harbor workers, federal government civilian contractors who work overseas, coal miners, federal employees and nuclear weapons workers. These programs provide a variety of benefits, including income replacement, medical benefits, vocational rehabilitation and survivor benefits.

"December 29, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20111229,"US Department of Labor's OSHA proposes $288,000 in fines to Case Farms Chicken for 61 violations at Winesburg, Ohio, processing facility","WINESBURG, Ohio – The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration has cited Case Farms Processing Inc., which operates Case Farms Chicken in Winesburg, for 61 safety and health violations. Violations related to OSHA's process safety management standards allegedly resulted in an ammonia release at the facility on June 30. Proposed fines total $288,000. ""Case Farms Chicken has a legal responsibility to follow established process safety management standards to ensure its workers are properly protected from known workplace safety and health hazards,"" said Deb Zubaty, OSHA's area director in Columbus. ""Failing to ensure protection through appropriate equipment maintenance, training and adherence to OSHA regulations demonstrates a lack of regard for employees' well-being. OSHA is committed to protecting workers, especially when employers fail to do so."" OSHA's safety and health inspections were initiated under the agency's Site-Specific Targeting Program, which focuses enforcement efforts on work sites where the highest rate of injuries and illnesses occur. Of 26 serious health violations, 19 relate to process safety management standards designed to reduce workers' exposure to hazardous chemicals. Areas of deficiency include process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, employee training, mechanical integrity, management of change, incident investigation and response to compliance audits. OSHA's standards contain specific requirements for the management of hazards associated with processes using dangerous chemicals. Additional information is available online at http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/processsafetymanagement/ . The process safety management citations along with those for failing to implement appropriate emergency operations are in reference to Case Farms' inadequate response to an ammonia leak, which coincidentally occurred on the morning OSHA, opened its routine inspection. No injuries or illnesses have yet been reported as a result of the ammonia leak. Of 30 serious safety violations, seven involve failing to provide machine guarding and 16 involve electrical safety standards including unsafe electrical practices that could have resulted in fire, electric shock or arc flash. The remainder involve failing to provide personal protective equipment to guard workers from falls and electrical hazards, allowing workers to walk on working surfaces without proper protection, and failing to implement and train workers in the use of lockout/tagout procedures to control hazardous energy sources. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known. Five other-than-serious health and safety citations address an additional lockout/tagout deficiency, as well as a failure to document process safety required tests and incident investigations, record respirator fit tests and provide refresher training to designated first aid providers. An other-than-serious violation is one that has a direct relationship to job safety and health, but probably would not cause death or serious physical harm.

OSHA opened its inspection after receiving a complaint in June about safety hazards at the Pascagoula shipyard. The initial inspection was expanded to a comprehensive safety and health inspection under OSHA's Site Specific Targeting Program, which focuses on companies in industries with higher-than-average injury and illness rates. Proposed penalties total $176,444. The company employs more than 38,000 workers in California, Louisiana, Mississippi and Virginia, and has contracts with the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard. It is based in Newport News, Va., and was formerly known as Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding. ""Huntington Ingalls employs more than 10,000 workers at this location who build ships for the federal government, and these employees deserve a first-rate occupational safety and health program. This is a wake-up call that the safety and health of workers needs to be the shipyard's highest priority,"" said Teresa Harrison, OSHA's acting regional administrator in Atlanta. OSHA cited Huntington Ingalls for 37 serious safety violations, carrying penalties of $150,300, for impalement, electrical, ""struck-by,"" scaffolding, blocked exits, compressed gases, rigging, machine guarding, welding, tripping and fall hazards. Four serious health violations with $16,000 in penalties include allowing lead, arsenic and cadmium dust to accumulate in a lunch area; dispensing of flammable liquids in improper containers; using containers for flammable liquids that were damaged; and not labeling adhesive and paint containers with hazard warnings. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known. Additionally, three other-than-serious violations with no monetary penalty were cited for failing to provide an exit sign, provide a floor plate to determine load capacity and use fixed wiring to replace a flexible cord. An other-than-serious violation is one that has a direct relationship to job safety and health, but probably would not cause death or serious physical harm. Industrial Corrosion Control Inc. was cited for two serious safety violations with $3,808 in penalties for improper handling of compressed gas cylinders, and allowing cables and hoses to be tripping hazards. General Insulation Inc. was cited for one serious safety violation with a $2,384 fine for an electrical hazard, and U.S. Joiner LLC also was cited for one serious safety violation with a $2,167 penalty for an electrical hazard. Marine Flooring LLC was cited for one serious violation with a $1,785 penalty for applying a corrosive material without ensuring that employees have access to an eyewash facility. Robert J. Baggett Inc. was cited for one other than serious safety violation with no monetary penalty for using a portable diesel fuel tank that lacked identification of its contents and an appropriate hazard warning.

"December 28, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20111228-0,"US Department of Labors OSHA proposes more than $1 million in fines to Houston, Texas, employer for willful and serious violations","Piping Technology and Products misled OSHA about amputation hazards HOUSTON – The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration has cited Piping Technology and Products Inc. for 13 willful and 17 serious violations for exposing workers to the risk of amputations and other serious injuries from dangerous machinery, as well as other hazards, at the company's Houston facility. Proposed penalties total $1,013,000. ""Repeatedly ignoring the law while risking workers' lives and providing misleading information to federal investigators will not be tolerated,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""Employers who endanger the lives and limbs of their employees must be held accountable."" A worker at Piping Technology contacted OSHA earlier this year, alleging a lack of brakes on overhead cranes and unguarded presses at the company's facility on Holmes Road. This complaint triggered an investigation by OSHA's Houston South Area Office. In addition to substantiating the complaint items, the inspection found that employees were permitted to cut metal I-beams and pipes without the proper machine guarding, which exposed them to possible severe injuries. Additionally, OSHA inspectors found that during machine maintenance, workers were exposed to the unexpected release of stored energy because of improper safeguards. ""Piping Technology deliberately exposed its workers who operate band saws and other dangerous machinery to amputation hazards while misleading OSHA investigators about the use of these machines,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for OSHA Dr. David Michaels. The willful violations involve the failure to guard seven band saws and to lock out all of the sources of hazardous energy to six pieces of equipment before service and maintenance. Each of the 13 citations carries a penalty of $70,000, for a total of $910,000. A willful violation is one committed with intentional knowing or voluntary disregard for the law's requirements, or with plain indifference to employee safety and health. The 17 serious violations, with penalties totaling $103,000, involve the failure to guard other machines and grinders properly, ensure that openings on electrical equipment were securely closed, provide fall protection training and ensure that employees wore hard hats when exposed to overhead hazards. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known. Piping Technology had knowledge of OSHA requirements due to citations issued in 1986, 1994, 2004 and 2005 that specifically addressed the need to guard the band saws used in production processes. In 2004 and 2005, OSHA cited the company with penalties totaling $82,500 and $33,000, respectively, for a variety of workplace hazards that included lockout/tagout violations. OSHA has placed Piping Technology in its Severe Violator Enforcement Program, which mandates targeted follow-up inspections to ensure compliance with the law. Initiated in June 2010, the program focuses on recalcitrant employers that endanger workers by committing willful, repeat or failure-to-abate violations.

Solis on agreement to extend unemployment benefits, payroll tax cut","WASHINGTON Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis today issued the following statement on the agreement to extend the payroll tax cut and Unemployment Insurance benefits: I m delighted, particularly as Americans look forward to spending the holidays with family and loved ones, that members of Congress have put partisan politics behind and reached an agreement on extending the payroll tax cuts and Unemployment Insurance benefits. For the average worker, the tax cut means keeping about $40 in every paycheck. And for those who have lost their job through no fault of their own, unemployment insurance is a critical lifeline. In very real terms, the payroll tax cut and the extension of unemployment benefits make a huge difference in keeping nutritious food on the table, buying a warm coat, paying a heating bill, and putting gas in the car. I very much hope that when Congress returns from their break, that they work diligently on behalf of hard working Americans, and reach a fair agreement to extend the tax cut and unemployment insurance for a full year."

"December 21, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20111221,MSHA announces results of November impact inspections,"ARLINGTON, Va. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration today announced that federal inspectors issued 315 citations, orders and safeguards during special impact inspections conducted at 10 coal mines and six metal/nonmetal mines last month. The coal mines were issued 200 citations, 50 orders and one safeguard, while the metal/nonmetal operations were issued 62 citations and two orders. These inspections, which began in force in April 2010 following the explosion at the Upper Big Branch Mine, involve mines that merit increased agency attention and enforcement due to their poor compliance history or particular compliance concerns, including high numbers of violations or closure orders; frequent hazard complaints or hotline calls; plan compliance issues; inadequate workplace examinations; a high number of accidents, injuries or illnesses; fatalities; and adverse conditions such as increased methane liberation, faulty roof conditions and inadequate ventilation. One of MSHA's most recent impact inspections was conducted during the day shift on Nov. 17 at Daystar Coal LLC's No. 3 Mine in Pike County, Ky. (Pike Floyd Mining Inc. since has taken over as operator of the mine.) The phones were captured and monitored during the inspection, which resulted in the issuance of 52 citations, 11 orders and one safeguard. The mine was issued an imminent danger order when an inspector observed that a bearing on a conveyor tailpiece was glowing orange with smoke rising from it in the presence of accumulations of float coal dust, coal fines and loose coal. The mine also allowed accumulations of float coal dust for a distance of 200 feet on top of previously rock dusted surfaces on the mine floor. Loose coal up to 18 inches deep had accumulated under the conveyor belt drive in the presence of ignition sources. Inspectors also found that the mine operator failed to follow the approved ventilation plan. Inspectors observed the cutting machine operating with virtually no air ventilating the mining face to remove respirable coal dust and gasses from the environment. The mine operator's failure to follow the plan created conditions that expose miners to the risk of black lung and explosions. Unwarrantable failure orders were issued for the accumulation of water at depths of 10 – 12 inches in front of seals in the return air course and in other locations throughout the mine. In addition, the operator failed to provide experienced miner training to 17 miners before they assumed their work duties underground and on the surface. The miners were withdrawn from the mine until they received the required training. All the citations issued during this impact inspection were modified to 104(b) failure-to-abate orders, and the mine subsequently was placed on abandoned status Dec. 5 and then on temporarily idled status Dec. 8 under new operator Pike Floyd Mining Inc. As a second example from last month, an inspection team arrived during the second shift on Nov. 4 at D&C Mining Corp.'s D&C Mine in Harlan County, Ky., and immediately captured and monitored the mine phone to prevent advance notification to workers underground. Inspectors issued 27 citations and 15 orders. Inspectors observed accumulations of combustible material, including float coal dust, along the mine's belt conveyors. For three consecutive day shifts, a certified foreman recorded in the mine's exam books that the mechanized mining unit needed to be cleaned and dusted. The mine was cited for loose coal up to 24 inches deep under the entire length of two belt conveyors and in the presence of conditions that created potential ignition sources. Unwarrantable failure orders were issued for unsafe roof conditions caused by roof bolt bearing plates not properly contacting the roof. Inspectors also noted inadequate fire protection on the conveyor belt, inadequate workplace examinations for hazardous conditions and missing equipment guards. This impact inspection was the mine's seventh. MSHA issued closure orders on Nov. 4 due to repeated hazards that the operator had failed to abate, and required D&C to take measures to ensure that it had a long-term solution for its history of repeated health and safety violations. ""I am particularly concerned about what goes on at mines with these kinds of inspection results when MSHA is not there,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""MSHA will continue to use all available tools at its disposal, including closure orders, to keep miners safe."" Since April 2010, MSHA has conducted 374 impact inspections, which have resulted in a total of 6,645 citations, 666 orders and 23 safeguards.

""This federal grant will give former Solo Cup workers in Massachusetts access to re-training and re-employment services to speed their transition to new jobs in growing local industries,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L.

Those workers in the group who are not TAA-eligible will have access to a broader array of training and employment-related services under this grant. Layoffs at Solo Cup began on Oct. 1, 2010, and continued through July 29, 2011, when the plant closed.

OSHA also has ordered the company to pay the employee more than $300,000 in back wages, compensatory damages, attorney's fees and punitive damages. The employee filed a whistleblower complaint with OSHA, alleging suspension without pay and then termination 23 days after notifying the company of an on-the-job injury. OSHA's investigation found reasonable cause to believe that the disciplinary charges and termination were not based on the complainant breaking a work rule but on the complainant reporting an injury to the railroad, in violation of the Federal Railroad Safety Act's whistleblower protection provisions. Union Pacific Railroad Co. was found to have similarly violated the FRSA in four other cases elsewhere in the U.S. since 2009. ""This case sends a clear message that OSHA will not tolerate retaliation against workers for reporting a work-related injury. An unreported injury is an uninvestigated injury. Nothing is learned that can help prevent the next injury,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for OSHA Dr. David Michaels. ""The safety of all workers is endangered when employers intimidate injured workers so that they do not report injuries."" In addition to reinstatement and monetary compensation, OSHA has ordered the railroad to refrain from retaliating against the employee for exercising rights guaranteed under the FRSA. OSHA enforces the whistleblower provisions of the FRSA and 20 other statues protecting employees who report violations of various securities, trucking, airline, nuclear, pipeline, environmental, public transportation, workplace safety and health, consumer product safety, health care reform and financial reform laws. Under these laws enacted by Congress, employers are prohibited from retaliating against employees who raise various protected concerns or provide protected information to the employer or to the government. Employees who believe that they have been retaliated against for engaging in protected conduct may file a complaint with the secretary of labor for an investigation by OSHA's Whistleblower Protection Program. Detailed information on employee whistleblower rights, including fact sheets with information on how to file a complaint with OSHA, is available online at http://www.whistleblowers.gov . Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. OSHA's role is to ensure these conditions for America's working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education and assistance.

To implement the project, Desarrollo y Autogestión will partner with World Learning, a U.S.-based nonprofit organization, and DESCO, a development organization. ""Ending exploitative child labor would have global benefits,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""This grant provides critical funding to bring us closer to that goal by providing targeted assistance to families and governments."" The project will target exploitative child labor in the provinces of Huancavelica, Pasco and Junín. Funds will be used to increase access to quality education, promote sustainable livelihoods and link beneficiaries to national social protection programs so families do not need to rely on child labor to meet basic needs. The project will engage local indigenous leaders and communities, and will benefit from the experience of Desarrollo y Autogestión in combating exploitative child labor among indigenous populations in Ecuador and Bolivia. It is designed to complement and support the government of Peru's strategies to combat poverty and social exclusion. Since 1995, Congress has appropriated approximately $840 million to the Labor Department to support global efforts to combat exploitative child labor. As a result, the department has rescued approximately 1.5 million children from exploitative child labor. More information on the department's efforts is available at http://www.dol.gov/whd/ .

Employee Stock Ownership Plan, has agreed to restore $225,000 to the Gagne ESOP and take other corrective action to resolve a lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Labor alleging violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. In a concurrent voluntary settlement agreement with the department, Thomas has agreed to pay $75,000 to the Frank L. Woodworth Inc. Employee Stock Ownership Plan, for which he also was a trustee. ERISA is the federal law that protects the assets and participants of private sector employee benefit plans. The department filed suit in February against Thomas regarding the Gagne ESOP in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania following an investigation by the Boston Regional Office of the department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration. The investigation found that Thomas violated his fiduciary duty by misappropriating and/or improperly diverting plan assets. Gagne Precast Concrete Products Inc. was located in Veazie, Maine, and Frank L. Woodworth Inc. was located in Detroit, Maine. The department filed its suit in Pennsylvania because Thomas now resides in York, Pa. Thomas has agreed to the appointment of an independent fiduciary, Northeast Retirement Services, for both plans, and will transfer all accounts of the ESOPs to accounts established in the name of the independent fiduciary. In addition to reimbursing both plans, Thomas will be responsible for all costs associated with administering them. The funds will be collected through a payment plan, with interim payments to be held by the independent fiduciary until distribution to the ESOPs’ participants. Thomas further has agreed to resign as a trustee to the plans; cooperate with the independent fiduciary, who will distribute each plan’s principal amount and interest to the respective participants and beneficiaries; and be enjoined from serving as a fiduciary or service provider to any ERISA-covered plan for a period of 10 years. “Fiduciaries may act only in the interests of a plan and its participants, never for their own benefit,” said Edward Maloney, EBSA’s acting regional director in Boston. “Such behavior needlessly places workers’ hard-earned benefits at risk.” “The Labor Department will take all necessary legal steps on behalf of plan participants when fiduciaries do not meet their legal obligations, including obtaining restitution and prohibiting an individual from serving as a plan fiduciary,” said Michael Felsen, the department’s regional solicitor in Boston. The case was litigated by the department’s Regional Office of the Solicitor in Boston. Employers and workers can contact EBSA by calling the agency’s toll-free number, 866-444-3272, for help with any problems relating to private sector pension and health plans.

The department’s lawsuit resulted from an investigation by its Employee Benefits Security Administration that revealed violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act by the company, its president, Edward Taylor Jeffreys, and its corporate secretary, James T. Jeffreys III. “Employees count on pensions and health benefits to provide security for themselves and their families,” said Isabel Colon, EBSA’s regional director in Atlanta. “The Labor Department is committed to holding fiduciaries of these plans accountable when they ignore the responsibility to act solely in the interest of plan participants.” EBSA’s investigation found that from January 2006 through January 2009, the defendants withheld employee contributions to the Jeffreys Seed Co. Profit Sharing Plan and Trust but failed to timely forward them to the retirement plan. Additionally, from March until September 2008, the defendants allegedly withheld $13,242.08 in employee contributions but failed to segregate and forward the contributions from company assets to the plan in accordance with ERISA requirements. Since the company closed in January 2009, the defendants have failed to distribute the retirement plan’s balance – approximately $134,000 – to its seven remaining participants. The Jeffreys Seed Co. Group Health Plan was funded by monthly premiums consisting of employee and employer contributions, which were collected by Jeffreys Seed Co. and transmitted to Blue Cross Blue Shield. From September through October 2008, Jeffreys Seed Co. and Edward Taylor Jeffeys allegedly withheld employee premium contributions of approximately $7,082 but failed to segregate and forward the contributions from company assets to the health plan in accordance with ERISA. In October 2008, Blue Cross Blue Shield informed defendants Jeffreys Seed Co. and Edward Taylor Jeffreys that the health plan was being retroactively terminated, effective Aug. 31, 2008, due to the lack of premium payments for September and October 2008. The lawsuit seeks a court order requiring all three defendants to restore all losses to the retirement plan, including interest or lost opportunity costs that occurred as a result of breaches of fiduciary obligations. It asks that the individual retirement plan accounts of any defendant be set off against the amount of losses, if the losses are not otherwise restored by the defendants. Additionally, the suit asks that Jeffreys Seed Co. and Edward Taylor Jeffreys restore all losses to the health plan participants, including interest or lost opportunity costs that occurred as a result of breaches of fiduciary obligations. Finally, the Labor Department is seeking a court order permanently barring the defendants from serving as fiduciaries of any employee benefit plan subject to ERISA and has asked that an independent fiduciary or administrator be appointed to the retirement plan at the defendants’ expense. This case was investigated by EBSA’s Atlanta Regional Office. It is being litigated by the Labor Department’s Regional Office of the Solicitor in Atlanta and was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina.

""Wisconsin's manufacturing sector has been hit hard by the economic downturn,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""This grant from the federal government will give workers who lost their jobs through no fault of their own continued access to re-employment and retraining services to help them obtain jobs in growing industries."" The funds are being awarded to the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development. They will be used to continue assisting these workers, many of whom also are certified as eligible for Trade Adjustment Assistance, by providing supportive services not available through the TAA program. Workers who are not TAA-eligible will have access to a broader array of training and employment-related services provided under this grant. A grant of up to $13,614,919 was awarded by the Labor Department to the state of Wisconsin in March 2010, with $5,072,148 released initially. An increment of $3,972,529 was provided in April 2011. Today's increment brings the total amount of funds provided to $12,434,907. National Emergency Grants are part of the secretary of labor's discretionary fund and are awarded based on a state's ability to meet specific guidelines.

"December 8, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20111208,US Department of Labor continues to cite beauty salons and manufacturers for formaldehyde exposure from hair smoothing products,"OSHA urges salon owners to implement protective measures WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration is continuing its efforts to protect workers from the dangers of formaldehyde exposure. In November, OSHA issued citations and fines to two salons for failing to implement precautions to protect workers from exposure to formaldehyde when using certain hair-smoothing products. Formaldehyde can irritate the eyes and nose; can cause allergic reactions of the skin, eyes and lungs; and is a cancer hazard. Salon owners who decide to use products that may contain or release formaldehyde must follow the requirements of OSHA's formaldehyde and hazard communication standards to keep workers safe. ""We want to make sure that salon owners are aware that if they use these products, they have to implement protective measures such as air monitoring and training,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for OSHA Dr. David Michaels. ""What is very troubling to the agency is that some of these products clearly expose workers to formaldehyde even when the label states they are 'formaldehyde free.'"" OSHA continues to respond to complaints and referrals of formaldehyde exposure in salons, beauty schools and manufacturing facilities. To date in calendar year 2011, federal OSHA has issued citations to 23 salon owners and beauty schools in Connecticut, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Florida, Illinois, New York, New Jersey and Ohio, with fines ranging up to $17,500 for failing to protect workers from overexposure and potential exposure to formaldehyde. Some of these violations include failing to communicate the hazards of exposure to formaldehyde, provide needed protective equipment and test air levels. The requirements of OSHA's formaldehyde standard can be viewed at http://s.dol.gov/KW. In three separate salons, OSHA's tests showed that workers were exposed to formaldehyde levels above the agency's 15-minute short-term exposure limit, which is 2.0 parts of formaldehyde per million parts of air. In one case, OSHA determined that a hair stylist was exposed to more than five times the allowable amount with an actual exposure reading of 10.12 ppm. In another instance, the exposure reading was 4.73 ppm. OSHA also has issued citations to two Florida manufacturers and two Florida-based distributors of hair products containing formaldehyde for failing to protect their own workers from possible formaldehyde exposure as well as to communicate the hazards of formaldehyde exposure to salons, stylists and consumers. The violations of OSHA's formaldehyde and hazard communication standards include failing to list formaldehyde as a hazardous ingredient on the material safety data sheet, the hazard warning sheet provided to users such as salon owners and stylists; include proper hazard warnings on product labels; and list the health effects of formaldehyde exposure on the MSDS. Labels must include ingredient and health hazard warning information, and the MSDS must provide users with information on the chemicals in a product, the hazards to workers and how to use the product safely. ""The best way to control exposure to formaldehyde is to use products that do not contain formaldehyde. Salons should check the label or product information to make sure it does not list formaldehyde, formalin, methylene glycol or any of the other names for formaldehyde,"" said Michaels. ""If salon owners decide to use products that contain or release formaldehyde, then they must follow a number of protective practices – including air monitoring, worker training and, if levels are over OSHA limits, good ventilation or respirators."" OSHA already has conducted significant outreach to salons, beauty schools and manufacturers to alert them about the hazards of hair smoothing products and the requirements of OSHA's standards. In late September, OSHA issued a second hazard alert to hair salon owners and workers about potential formaldehyde exposure from working with certain hair smoothing and straightening products, which can be viewed at http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/formaldehyde/hazard_alert.html . This alert, which revised the initial alert issued last spring, was prompted by the results of additional agency inspections, a warning letter issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and factually incorrect information recently sent to salons by Brazilian Blowout, a company that manufactures hair products. In response to the Aug. 24 letter sent by Brazilian Blowout to salon owners claiming that all OSHA air tests performed on the company's Brazilian Blowout Professional Acai Smoothing Solution yielded results below OSHA's standard for exposure, the agency sent a letter to the company refuting that assertion. OSHA's letter can be viewed at http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/formaldehyde/brazilian_blowout_letter.pdf . For more information on formaldehyde exposure in salons, visit http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/hairsalons/ . For small businesses in all states across the country, OSHA's On-site Consultation Program offers free and confidential advice for employers seeking help to identify and prevent job hazards or improve their safety and health management systems. In fiscal year 2010, the program provided free assistance to more than 30,000 small businesses covering more than 1.5 million workers across the nation. For more information, visit http://www.osha.gov/dcsp/smallbusiness/consult.html . ""These consultation services are separate from enforcement and do not result in penalties or citations,"" said Michaels. ""Consultants from state agencies or universities work with employers to identify workplace hazards, provide advice on compliance with OSHA standards, and assist in establishing safety and health management systems."" Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. OSHA's role is to ensure these conditions for America's working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education and assistance.

"December 8, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ofccp/ofccp20111208,US Labor Department seeks to improve job opportunities for Americans with disabilities by setting historic hiring goal for federal contractors and subcontractors,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Labor is proposing a new rule that would require federal contractors and subcontractors to set a hiring goal of having 7 percent of their workforces be people with disabilities, among other requirements. The department's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs invites public comment on this proposal, which will be published in the Dec. 9 edition of the Federal Register. OFCCP's proposed rule would strengthen the affirmative action requirements established in Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 obligating federal contractors and subcontractors to ensure equal employment opportunities for qualified workers with disabilities. The proposed regulatory changes detail specific actions contractors must take in the areas of recruitment, training, record keeping and policy dissemination — similar to those that have long been required to promote workplace equality for women and minorities. In addition, the rule would clarify OFCCP's expectations for contractors by providing specific guidance on how to comply with the law. ""This proposed rule represents one of the most significant advances in protecting the civil rights of workers with disabilities since the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""President Obama has demonstrated a commitment to people with disabilities. This proposed rule would help federal contractors better fulfill their legal responsibility to hire qualified workers with disabilities."" Although Section 503 regulations have been in place for decades, the current unemployment rate for people with disabilities is 13 percent, 1 1/2 times the rate of those without disabilities. Even more discouraging, data published last week by the department's Bureau of Labor Statistics show stark disparities facing working-age individuals with disabilities, with 79.2 percent outside the labor force altogether, compared to 30.5 percent of those without disabilities. ""For nearly 40 years, the rules have said that contractors simply need to make a 'good faith' effort to recruit and hire people with disabilities. Clearly, that's not working,"" said OFCCP Director Patricia A. Shiu. ""Our proposal would define specific goals, require real accountability and provide the clearest possible guidance for employers seeking to comply with the law. What gets measured gets done. And we're in the business of getting things done."" Establishing a 7 percent hiring goal for the employment of individuals with disabilities would be a tool for contractors to measure the effectiveness of their affirmative action efforts and thereby inform their decision-making. The proposed rule also would enhance data collection and record-keeping requirements — including for documentation and processing of requests for reasonable accommodation — in order to improve accountability. Additionally, it would ensure annual self-reviews of employers' recruitment and outreach efforts, and add a new requirement for contractors to list job openings to increase their pools of qualified applicants. To read the notice of proposed rulemaking or submit a comment, visit the federal e-rulemaking portal at http://www.regulations.gov . Comments also can be submitted by mail to Debra Carr, Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, U.S. Department of Labor, Room C-3325, 200 Constitution Ave. NW, Washington, D.C. 20210. All comments must be received by Feb. 7, 2012, and should include identification number (RIN) 1250-AA02. In addition to Section 503, OFCCP enforces Executive Order 11246 and the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974. As amended, these three laws require those who do business with the federal government, both contractors and subcontractors, to follow the fair and reasonable standard that they take affirmative action and not discriminate in employment on the basis of sex, race, color, religion, national origin, disability or status as a protected veteran.

Goble, Stephens’ Drugs Inc. and the Stephens’ Drugs 401(k) Retirement Plan located in Louisville, Ky. Allegations: Gary Goble and Stephens’ Drugs Inc., in their capacities as fiduciaries to the Stephens’ Drugs 401(k) Retirement Plan, failed to ensure that employee pre-tax contributions withheld by the company for the payroll pay dates January 5, 2007, through May 1, 2010, were segregated from the company’s general assets as soon as defendants reasonably could do so and did not remit all of them to the plan. Resolution: The Department of Labor filed a civil complaint on November 22, 2011, and the court entered a consent order and judgment on December 2, 2011, in which the parties agreed that Goble and the company are jointly and severally liable to the retirement plan for $19,762.62, representing unremitted employee contributions and lost opportunity costs owed to the retirement plan. Goble and the company were ordered to pay $19,762.62 to the retirement plan on or before December 1, 2011. The parties also agreed to remove Goble and the company as fiduciaries of the retirement plan and appoint AMI Benefit Plan Administrators Inc. as an independent fiduciary to allocate the retirement plan assets, terminate the retirement plan and distribute retirement plan assets to participants. Goble agreed to pay the fees of the independent fiduciary. Goble and the company are permanently enjoined from violating Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and from serving as fiduciaries or service providers to any employee benefit plan subject to ERISA.

"December 7, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20111207,"Merrill Lynch agrees to restore more than $170,000 to settle with US Labor Department over allegations of pension plan misconduct in Alabama","MONTGOMERY , Ala. – Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc. has settled allegations made by the U.S. Department of Labor that the company and one of its employees violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act by failing to prevent the fiduciaries of pension plans of two Alabama-based companies from engaging in prohibited transactions. The out-of-court settlement requires Merrill Lynch to restore a total of $170,854 to the plans and provide additional training to its investment advisers serving as fiduciaries of employee benefit plans. The agreement follows allegations by the Labor Department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration that fiduciaries of the Amtren Corp. and Otorhinolaryngology Associates PC profit-sharing pension plans made improper loans. Gilbert Meadows III, an investment adviser at Merrill Lynch’s Montgomery branch office, provided advisory services to both plans. EBSA alleged that Meadows knew the loans were imprudent and considered prohibited transactions under ERISA but failed to take reasonable efforts to remedy these breaches of duty by his co-fiduciaries. “Financial advisors to pension plans have a fiduciary responsibility to act solely in the best interests of plan participants,” said Isabel Colon, EBSA’s regional director in Atlanta. “We are pleased that Merrill Lynch recognizes that its advisers have an obligation to fully meet the standards set by ERISA.” Merrill Lynch has restored $56,599 to the Otorhinolaryngology Associates plan, and also has agreed to restore $114,255 to the Amtren plan once an independent fiduciary is appointed at Merrill Lynch’s expense to administer the plan. Additionally, Merrill Lynch will issue a written notice and provide training regarding the fiduciary and co-fiduciary obligations imposed by ERISA to all of its financial advisers who are acknowledged fiduciaries under the company’s Personal Investment Advisory program. Merrill Lynch will place Meadows under a heightened supervision plan for two years, and he will be required to complete additional professional education before being allowed to serve as a financial adviser or other fiduciary to any ERISA-covered employee benefit plan. The company also will conduct a self-audit of all other ERISA-covered employee benefit plans among its clients for which Meadows is or was a financial adviser. Finally, the company will conduct quarterly reviews of Meadows’ performance with respect to ERISA-governed plans for a period of two years. This case was investigated by EBSA’s Atlanta Regional Office. The settlement was reached with the assistance of the Labor Department’s Regional Office of the Solicitor in Atlanta. Employers and workers can contact EBSA at 404-302-3900 or toll-free at 866-444-3272 for help with problems relating to private sector retirement and health plans.

"December 6, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20111206,US Labor Departments MSHA cites corporate culture as root cause of Upper Big Branch Mine disaster,"Massey issued 369 citations and orders with $10.8 million in civil penalties ARLINGTON, Va. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration today announced that it has imposed a fine of $10,825,368, the largest in agency history, following its investigation into the April 2010 explosion at the Upper Big Branch-South Mine, which was operated by Performance Coal Co., a subsidiary of Massey Energy Co. The investigation followed an explosion that killed 29 miners and injured two – the worst U.S. coal mining disaster in 40 years. A report concludes that Massey's corporate culture was the root cause of the tragedy. MSHA has issued Massey and PCC 369 citations and orders, including for an unprecedented 21 flagrant violations, which carry the most serious civil penalties available under the law. Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis, Solicitor of Labor M. Patricia Smith, MSHA Assistant Secretary Joseph A. Main and MSHA Administrator for Coal Kevin Stricklin met with families today to share the agency's findings. ""The tragic explosion at Upper Big Branch left dozens of families without husbands, fathers, brothers and sons,"" said Secretary Solis. ""I made a pledge to the families of those we lost, and the entire mining community, to conduct the most complete and thorough investigation possible in order to find the cause of this disaster. The results of the investigation lead to the conclusion that PCC/Massey promoted and enforced a workplace culture that valued production over safety, and broke the law as they endangered the lives of their miners. By issuing the largest fine in MSHA's history, I hope to send a strong message that the safety of miners must come first."" The agency's presentation of findings follows a non-prosecution agreement reached today among the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of West Virginia, the U.S. Department of Justice, Alpha Natural Resources Inc. and Alpha Appalachia Holdings Inc., formerly known as Massey Energy Co. The agreement – which includes nearly $210 million for remedial safety measures at all Alpha mines, a trust fund for improvements in mine safety and health, payment of outstanding civil penalties for all former Massey mines and restitution payments for the victims' families – resolves criminal liability for Alpha but does not provide protection against criminal prosecution of any individuals. ""This agreement can go a long way toward changing a safety culture that was clearly broken at Massey's mines,"" said Secretary Solis. ""Although this agreement is significant, it in no way absolves any individuals responsible for this terrible tragedy of their criminal liability. We will continue to cooperate with the U.S. Attorney's Office to ensure that the responsible parties will be brought to justice."" MSHA concluded that the 29 miners died in a massive coal dust explosion that started as a methane ignition. While the investigation found the physical conditions that led to the coal dust explosion were the result of a series of basic safety violations at UBB, which PCC and Massey disregarded, the report cites unlawful policies and practices implemented by PCC and Massey as the root cause of the explosion – including the intimidation of miners, advance notice of inspections, and two sets of books with hazards recorded in UBB's internal production and maintenance book but not in the official examination book. The investigation found that the operator promoted and enforced a workplace culture that valued production over safety, including practices calculated to allow it to conduct mining operations in violation of the law. ""Every time Massey sent miners into the UBB Mine, Massey put those miners' lives at risk. Massey management created a culture of fear and intimidation in their miners to hide their reckless practices. Today's report brings to light the tragic consequences of a corporate culture that values production over people,"" said Main. ""The secretary and I are committed to improving the health and safety of America's miners. To honor the memory of the lives lost at UBB, we will use the lessons learned from this terrible tragedy to fulfill that commitment."" MSHA issued PCC and Massey 12 citations and orders deemed contributory to the cause of the accident, and nine of those violations were assessed as flagrant, which carry the highest possible penalties. Violations include illegally providing advance notice to miners of MSHA inspections; failing to properly conduct required examinations; allowing hazardous levels of loose coal, coal dust and float coal dust to accumulate; failing to adequately apply rock dust to the mine; failing to adequately train miners; and failing to comply with approved ventilation plans and approved roof control plans. MSHA also issued 357 citations and orders to PCC and Massey that did not contribute directly to the explosion, including 11 assessed as flagrant. Additionally, MSHA issued two contributory and two non-contributory violations to David Stanley Consulting LLC – a contractor that supplied examiners and other miners to work at UBB – for its examiner's failure to properly conduct examinations. These violations carry penalties of $142,684. MSHA conducted its investigation under the authority of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, which requires that authorized representatives of the secretary of labor carry out investigations in mines for the purpose of obtaining, utilizing and disseminating information relating to the causes of the accidents.

"December 6, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20111206,"US Department of Labor settles litigation against grain bin operator in July 2010 deaths of 2 teens in Mount Carroll, Ill.","CHICAGO – The U.S. Department of Labor has reached an agreement with Haasbach LLC in Mount Carroll, resolving 25 citations issued by the department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration and child labor civil money penalties assessed by its Wage and Hour Division. The resolution follows the deaths of Wyatt Whitebread, 14, and Alex Pacas, 19, at the company's Mt. Carroll grain bin facility in July 2010. A 20-year-old worker also was seriously injured in the incident. ""This tragedy has had a profound effect on the community of Mt. Carroll and the grain industry nationwide,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for OSHA Dr. David Michaels. ""We hope that the deaths of these two young men send a profound and unmistakable message throughout the grain industry that loss of life can and must be prevented."" At the time of the incident, the workers were ""walking down the corn"" to make it flow while machinery used to convey the grain was running. All three became trapped in corn more than 30 feet deep, and Whitebread and Pacas suffocated. OSHA cited Haasbach for 12 willful, 12 serious and one other-than-serious violation of the agency's grain standards. Following the agreement reached in this case, which was approved by an administrative law judge of the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission, the company must pay $200,000 in penalties, an amount amended from the original fines assessed. Haasbach is no longer in business. Since 2009, OSHA has fined grain operators in Illinois, Colorado, South Dakota and Wisconsin following similar preventable fatalities and injuries. In addition to enforcement actions, Michaels sent a notification letter to grain elevator operators warning them not to allow workers to enter grain storage facilities without proper equipment, precautions and training. ""OSHA will not tolerate noncompliance with the Grain Handling Facilities standard,"" said Michaels in the letter. ""We will continue to use our enforcement authority to the fullest extent possible."" OSHA's Region V, which includes Illinois, Ohio and Wisconsin, initiated a Grain Safety Local Emphasis Program in August 2010. This program focuses on hazards associated with grain engulfment, machine guarding, lockout/tagout of dangerous equipment to prevent accidental start up, electricity, falls, employee training and combustible dust hazards. A separate investigation by the Labor Department's Wage and Hour Division found that Haasbach violated the Fair Labor Standards Act's child labor provisions by employing workers under age 18 to perform hazardous jobs that are prohibited by the FLSA. Under the agreement, Haasbach will pay $68,125, the full civil money penalty originally assessed as a result of those violations. ""It is against the law to put the health and well-being of minors at risk by requiring them to perform prohibited hazardous jobs,"" said Nancy Leppink, deputy administrator of the Wage and Hour Division. ""It is the employer's responsibility to know and adhere to child labor laws and regulations. If violators decide not to follow the law, they should know that the Wage and Hour Division will not hesitate to use all available tools, including litigation, to pursue those who put young workers in harm's way."" Under the FLSA's child labor provisions, the secretary of labor has declared certain jobs too hazardous for anyone younger than 18 to perform and other jobs too dangerous for anyone younger than 16. For example, employing and requiring anyone younger than 16 to work in occupations involving warehousing or transportation, including in a grain bin operation, is a violation. Similarly, employing a worker younger than 18 to climb on top of a high grain bin violates a hazardous order, as does having a minor work in a hazardous occupation involving the operation of a power-driven hoisting device. These rules must be followed unless a specific exemption applies. More information on child labor rules can be found at http://www.dol.gov/elaws/youth.html , and information about hazardous occupations orders is available at http://www.dol.gov/elaws/esa/flsa/docs/haznonag.asp . The Labor Department has proposed a regulation that would, among other changes, create a new hazardous occupations order involving the agricultural employment of individuals under age 18. The regulation would prohibit them from being employed in the storing, marketing and transporting of farm-product raw materials. Prohibited places of employment would include country grain elevators, grain bins, silos, feed lots, stockyards, livestock exchanges and livestock auctions.

"December 6, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20111206,"US Labor Department investigation results in former Alabama computer device maker being ordered to restore more than $114,000 to pension plan","MONTGOMERY , Ala. – A federal court has removed Amtren Corp. and former president Charles Kirk Lamberth as fiduciaries from the Amtren Corp. Profit Sharing Plan and ordered them to restore $114,255 to the defunct company’s pension plan after an investigation by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Employee Benefits Security Administration found evidence of an improper loan that violated provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. In June, the Labor Department filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama, Northern Division, based on EBSA’s investigation. The investigation found that the defendants caused the retirement plan to transfer the majority of its assets to the company, allegedly as a loan, which exposed the plan to the risk of large losses by not diversifying its assets. The defendants failed to execute any loan documents for the loan, failed to require the company to provide security or a promissory note for the loan and never ensured that the company make any loan repayments or interest payments to the plan. Amtren, which manufactured computer-related devices, was based in Montgomery and ceased operations during or around late 2006. “The Labor Department will not allow fiduciaries to act recklessly with participants’ retirement funds,” said Isabel Colon, EBSA’s regional director in Atlanta. “By law, fiduciaries must act solely in the best interests of plan participants, which clearly was not the case in this instance.” The court has ordered that the defendants be permanently barred from acting as fiduciaries of any employee benefit plan subject to ERISA. Any participant interest held by Lamberth in existing or future assets of the plan will be applied as an offset against the amount due the plan. Jeanne Bryant has been appointed as successor fiduciary. Her expenses will be paid from the assets of the plan, and the defendants will be held liable for reimbursing the plan for those expenses. In a related action, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc. has agreed to restore assets to the Amtren plan following allegations by EBSA that one of its investment advisors, Gilbert Meadows III, failed to take action to protect the plan from the prohibited transaction initiated by the defendants. This case was investigated by EBSA’s Atlanta Regional Office. It was litigated by the Labor Department’s Regional Office of the Solicitor in Atlanta.

"December 5, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20111205,"US Labor Department, Colorado Department of Labor and Employment sign agreement to reduce misclassification of employees as independent contractors","WASHINGTON — Nancy J. Leppink, deputy administrator of the U.S. Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division, and Ellen Golombek, executive director of the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment, signed a memorandum of understanding Dec. 5 regarding the improper classification of employees as independent contractors. Following the signing, Leppink and Golombek hosted a press teleconference during which they discussed how the U.S. Department of Labor and the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment will embark on new efforts, guided by this memorandum, to protect the rights of employees and level the playing field for responsible employers by reducing the practice conducted by some businesses of misclassifying employees. This partnership is the 11th of its kind for the U.S. Department of Labor. ""This memorandum of understanding helps us send a message: We're standing united to end the practice of misclassifying employees,"" said Leppink. ""This is an important step toward making sure that the American dream is still available for employees and responsible employers alike."" ""Misclassification costs everyone,"" said Golombek. ""It destabilizes the business climate by creating an unlevel playing field and causing responsible businesses to suffer unfair competition. The efforts we will be launching with the U.S. Department of Labor will promote accountability that Colorado employers and employees will welcome."" Employee misclassification is a growing problem. In 2010, the Wage and Hour Division collected nearly $4 million in back wages for minimum wage and overtime violations under the Fair Labor Standards Act that resulted from employees being misclassified as independent contractors or otherwise not treated as employees. Business models that attempt to change, obscure or eliminate the employment relationship are not inherently illegal, unless they are used to evade compliance with federal labor law. The misclassification of employees as something else, such as independent contractors, presents a serious problem, as these employees often are denied access to critical benefits and protections — such as family and medical leave, overtime compensation, minimum wage pay and Unemployment Insurance — to which they are entitled. In addition, misclassification can create economic pressure for law-abiding business owners, who often find it difficult to compete with those who are skirting the law.Employee misclassification also generates substantial losses for state Unemployment Insurance and workers' compensation funds. Memorandums of understanding with state government agencies arose as part of the U.S. Department of Labor's Misclassification Initiative, which was launched under the auspices of Vice President Biden's Middle Class Task Force with the goal of preventing, detecting and remedying employee misclassification. Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Utah and Washington have signed similar agreements. More information is available on the U.S. Department of Labor's misclassification Web page at http://www.dol.gov/misclassification . The mission of the U.S. Department of Labor is to foster, promote and develop the welfare of the wage earners, job seekers and retirees of the United States; improve working conditions; advance opportunities for profitable employment; and ensure work-related benefits and rights.

"December 5, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20111205-0,"US Labor Department proposes rules under Affordable Care Act to crack down on health care fraud, protect workers and small businesses","WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor's Employee Benefits Security Administration today announced two proposed rules under the Affordable Care Act to protect businesses and workers whose health benefits are provided through a multiple employer welfare arrangement. MEWAs frequently have been used by scam artists and criminals to defraud consumers, resulting in an inability to pay medical claims. When such MEWAs become insolvent, they may leave consumers with substantial unpaid medical bills. For employers or employee organizations that have paid premiums or made contributions to a MEWA, and thought they were doing the right thing for their workers and their families, the impact also can be significant. The proposed rules call for MEWAs to adhere to enhanced reporting requirements so that employers, workers and their families will not unexpectedly be cut off from needed health care services. The rules also will increase the Labor Department's enforcement authority to protect participants in such plans and allow the department to shut down MEWAs engaged in fraud or other activities that present an immediate danger to the public safety or welfare. ""Too many MEWAs are taking advantage of good employers who want to make health insurance available to their workers, and too many hardworking Americans have suffered,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""These proposed rules under the Affordable Care Act will crack down on those who want to use MEWAs to defraud American families."" Through MEWAs, unrelated employers, typically small businesses, seek to provide health care and other benefits to their workers at what is represented to be a lower cost than other traditional forms of coverage. The promoters, marketers and operators of MEWAs often have taken advantage of gaps in the law to avoid state insurance regulations, such as a requirement to maintain sufficient funding and adequate reserves to pay the health care claims of workers and their families. In the worst situations, operators of MEWAs have drained their assets through excessive administrative fees or outright embezzlement, resulting in harm to participants and their families. In some cases, individuals incur significant medical bills before they learn that claims are not being paid – and that they are liable and need to pay their medical bills themselves. The Affordable Care Act includes provisions designed to remedy these gaps. Under the proposals issued today: MEWAs must register with the Department of Labor prior to operating in a state or be subject to substantial penalties. This step will allow the department to track MEWAs as they move from state to state and to identify their principals, which will provide the department with important information regarding potentially fraudulent MEWAs. The secretary of labor will be able to issue a cease and desist order when it appears that fraud is taking place or an arrangement is causing immediate danger to the public safety or welfare. The secretary of labor could seize assets from a MEWA when there is probable cause that the plan is in a financially hazardous condition. Complete details on all provisions will be published in the Dec. 6 Federal Register and also are available at http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/healthreform/ . Since President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act in March 2010, more than 22.6 million people with Medicare have received free preventive care benefits such as screenings and vaccinations, and another 2.2 million have saved more than $1.2 billion on their prescription drugs – an average savings of $550 per person. Additionally, adults under the age of 26 are now able to remain on a parent's health insurance plan, small businesses and tax-exempt organizations are eligible for tax credits and the denial of coverage to those with pre-existing conditions is coming to an end.

"December 2, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20111202,Statement by Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis on November employment numbers,"WASHINGTON – Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis today issued the following statement on the November 2011 Employment Situation report released today: ""Our nation's unemployment rate experienced a significant drop to 8.6 percent in November, a full 1.2 percentage points lower than this time last year. Nonfarm payroll employment added 140,000 private sector jobs last month. This means we've added 1.9 million private sector jobs over the past year – an average of 157,000 a month. ""The policies this administration has pursued are adding jobs back into the economy, and our recovery is picking up steam. In November, American companies increased hiring across virtually all regions and all sectors to keep pace with growing consumer consumption and demand. Last week we saw people talk with their wallets. One week after soaring Black Friday spending, we are seeing job growth firmly in the black heading into the holidays. ""Personal income and consumer spending are both up. Americans are showing more confidence in the economy. Now it's incumbent upon Washington to give them confidence in our government to solve our biggest challenges and put millions of Americans back to work. This is a strong report, but we can't forget those Americans who lost their jobs during the recession and are still struggling. ""We know what has worked: extending payroll tax cuts and unemployment insurance, and making smart investments in our economy. The clock is ticking. If Congress doesn't extend emergency unemployment benefits for our long-term unemployed this month, 5 million Americans will lose their benefits next year. These are the everyday heroes of our recovery who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own. They spend all day, every day filling out applications, sending out resumes and looking for work. Now is not the time to turn our backs on them. They deserve better. They deserve action. ""Congress must act immediately to extend emergency unemployment benefits and payroll tax relief. We must pass these measures this month to continue the positive trends we're seeing in today's report."""
"December 1, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20111201,Statement by Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis on World AIDS Day,"WASHINGTON – In commemoration of World AIDS Day, Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis released the following statement highlighting the U.S. Department of Labor's ongoing efforts in the global fight against HIV/AIDS: "" This year, on World AIDS Day, a new report from the United Nations shows we've achieved an encouraging 21 percent reduction in deaths of people living with HIV/AIDS across the globe. With so many people living longer, healthier lives, we must redouble our efforts to ensure that workplaces are free of discrimination on the basis of HIV status. This is both a human and a civil right. ""At the U.S. Department of Labor, we are committed to working on multiple fronts to reduce the stigma surrounding this condition and ensure that HIV-positive workers know their workplace rights. ""On the global front, my department's Bureau of International Labor Affairs is working to promote global awareness of compassionate approaches to HIV/AIDS by helping other countries develop policies and programs to combat job discrimination. Our educational workshops and training programs have reached 3.3 million workers in 30 countries. These programs educate employers about the importance of treating workers who have HIV/AIDS with dignity and respect. ""Here in the United States, my department's Wage and Hour Division is vigorously enforcing the Family and Medical Leave Act so workers with HIV/AIDS have the workplace flexibility and medical privacy guaranteed by law. Taking time off to care for yourself or a family member who has HIV/AIDS should not put your livelihood in jeopardy. The FMLA gives workers the peace of mind of knowing that their jobs are protected when they take time off because of illness. We will continue to educate employers about their responsibility to provide eligible workers with up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave to recover from HIV-related illness or to care for a covered family member living with HIV/AIDS. ""Other organizations within the U.S. Department of Labor are playing important roles as well. ""Our Occupational Safety and Health Administration is enforcing safety standards to prevent inadvertent HIV/AIDS transmission in the workplace. Enforcement of OSHA rules on bloodborne pathogens has led to significant reductions of needle-stick injuries and the transmission of bloodborne diseases in medical settings. Our work has helped spur new technological advances in the development of safer needle devices, so America's health care workers can provide safe, high-quality and compassionate care. ""Our Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs is prioritizing investigations of employment discrimination based on HIV/AIDS status. Workers cannot be denied employment, harassed, demoted, fired, paid less or treated poorly because of their HIV status. Through our aggressive public education campaign, we are informing workers of their rights and employers of their responsibilities under federal law. ""And our Office of Disability Employment Policy is conducting national outreach to increase access to workplace training, career counseling and employment-related services for people living with HIV/AIDS. ODEP is also working with employers and employees across the country to promote the availability of reasonable accommodations for workers living with HIV/AIDS."""
"December 1, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20111201,MSHA to start using pre-assessment conferencing procedures,"ARLINGTON, Va. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration will begin implementing pre-assessment conferencing procedures in January 2012 to help reduce any backlog of future violations before the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission. Under the procedures in most MSHA districts, a mine operator and miners' representative may request a conference regarding a contested citation or order only after MSHA proposes a penalty assessment, and any settlements require approval by the commission. The new procedures are based on the results of a pilot program launched by MSHA Assistant Secretary Joseph A. Main in August 2010 that evaluated the effect of the pre-assessment conference on contested citations. The evaluation incorporated input from industry stakeholders, including mine operators and miners' representatives. ""This new conferencing process will help reduce the backlog of cases that go before the commission by resolving disputes before litigation ever occurs,"" said Main. ""We are implementing a process that will provide early resolution of disputes, reduce the number of contested citations and orders, increase accuracy and consistency, and improve communication among mine operators, miners and MSHA."" Each MSHA district must determine when to implement the procedures based on available resources. Implementation may occur slowly or not at all in some districts, until other backlog reduction strategies take hold and make the caseloads more manageable. During the pilot program, operators frequently opted not to request pre-assessment conferences, but there was a high resolution rate for those that did. ""Although no single strategy will reduce the backlog of contested cases before the commission, this is one aspect of a larger plan, taking advantage of reduction opportunities where they can be found and implemented,"" said Main. Among the key findings in the evaluation of the pilot program (which can be found at http://www.msha.gov/PreAssess/PreAssessConfEval2011.pdf ): Most contested violations did not go through the conference process. Most violations that went to conference were settled without a contest being filed. Ten mining companies accounted for more than half of all contested violations. Most mine operators surveyed stated that they felt comfortable in communicating concerns and expressed satisfaction with the conferencing procedures used during the pilot. Stakeholders expressed widespread support for the conference process. Additional resources will be needed to implement an agencywide conferencing program. Pilot districts estimated that while the actual conference took a short period of time, preparation for the conference could take as much as 1 to 2 hours per violation. The number of contested proposed civil penalties increased dramatically between 2007 and 2010, creating a backlog of more than 89,000 citations awaiting adjudication by the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission. The rise in contested violations has been attributed to the increase in penalty amounts and overall number of violations cited, the potential pattern of violations program and the replacement of pre-assessment conferences with post-assessment enhanced conferences. In the Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2010, Congress provided $18.2 million to allow the Department of Labor to begin reducing the existing case backlog before the commission, and for other purposes related to mine safety. As of Sept. 30, the total number of citations in the backlog was down to approximately 69,000."

"December 1, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ofccp/ofccp20111201,US Labor Department files complaint against Brunswick Corp. and Lund Boat Co. for sex discrimination at Minnesota manufacturing plant,"More than 200 women applicants affected; complaint seeks back wages, job opportunities WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs is suing federal contractor Brunswick Corp. and Lund Boat Co., a wholly-owned subsidiary. In an administrative complaint filed today with the department's Office of Administrative Law Judges, OFCCP asserts that the companies systematically discriminated against more than 200 women who applied for entry-level positions at Lund's boat manufacturing plant in New York Mills, Minn. ""Representatives from Lund have argued that women were less likely to be hired than men because of a preference for workers with manufacturing experience,"" said Solicitor of Labor M. Patricia Smith. ""However, OFCCP's investigation found that even women with this type of experience were less likely to be hired than men without it. That's not fair. It's not right. And it's against the law."" Under Executive Order 11246, federal contractors are required to ensure that qualified job applicants receive equal consideration for employment without regard to their sex. OFCCP's complaint requests that Lund and Brunswick provide financial remedies — including lost wages, interest and benefits — to the women affected by the discriminatory practices. Furthermore, the agency asks that job offers be extended to at least 27 women in the original group of applicants. Finally, the suit asks that the companies be prohibited from extending or modifying current government contracts and from entering into future contracts until they have remedied these violations. ""Brunswick's Chairman and CEO, Dustan McCoy, has stated a commitment to acting ethically,"" said OFCCP Director Patricia A. Shiu. ""By his own words, 'Acting ethically simply means that we do what is right in all situations.' So, we ask him now to do what is right for the women who sought a fair shot at employment with his company and for the taxpayers who deserve to know that their money is never used to discriminate."" Based in Lake Forest, Ill., Brunswick is a leading provider of marine, athletic and recreational products. Lund serves as the corporation's boat manufacturing division. In the past two years alone, Brunswick held federal contracts totaling almost $23 million with agencies including the U.S. Departments of Defense and Homeland Security, among others. In addition to Executive Order 11246, OFCCP enforces Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974. As amended, these three laws require those who do business with the federal government, both contractors and subcontractors, follow the fair and reasonable standard that they not discriminate in employment on the basis of sex, race, color, religion, national origin, disability or status as a protected veteran.

"November 30, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20111130,MSHA puts 8 mines on notice for potential patterns of violations,"ARLINGTON, Va. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration today announced that eight mines around the country have received letters putting them on notice that each has a potential pattern of violations of mandatory health or safety standards under Section 104(e) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. The PPOV screening from which these letters resulted represents the second since MSHA established the current criteria and procedures in September 2010. The eight mines that received letters are as follows: Marfork Coal Co. Inc.'s Parker Peerless Mine in Raleigh County, W.Va. Pay Car Mining Inc.'s No. 58 Mine in McDowell County, W.Va. Pine Ridge Coal Co. LLC's Big Mountain No. 16 in Boone County, W.Va. (previously received PPOV notice in October 2009) Rio Group Inc.'s Coalburg No. 2 Mine in Logan County, W.Va. Nine Mile Mining Inc.'s No. 3 Mine in Wise County, Va. Manalapan Mining Co. Inc.'s RB No. 12 in Harlan County, Ky. Big Ridge Inc.'s Willow Lake Portal in Saline County, Ill. (previously received PPOV notice in November 2010) Queenstake Resources U.S.A. Inc.'s Jerritt Canyon Mill in Elko, Nev. ""In April, MSHA briefed stakeholders on a new and transparent online tool that allows mine operators to regularly monitor their compliance and injury records under the PPOV initial screening criteria and make adjustments to improve health and safety accordingly,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""Unfortunately, some operators either did not use this tool or did not respond with effective improvements."" The Mine Act provides for enhanced enforcement at mines that exhibit a pattern of violations of significant and substantial – known as S&S – health or safety violations. MSHA regulations provide that the agency screen for PPOV mines at least once a year. Mines that receive PPOV notices have the opportunity to implement corrective action programs, and they must reduce their S&S rates to targets set by the agency. Mine operators that do not meet these targets are subject to a notice for a pattern of violations and closure orders for all S&S violations under Section 104(e). MSHA encourages mine operators to implement corrective action programs with long-term goals for reducing violations beyond the goals established by MSHA under the POV procedures. In addition to the eight mines receiving PPOV notices, other mines are still under PPOV consideration. These include mines for which MSHA is verifying self-reported injury information to ensure that it is accurate and thereby confirm that the operators do not meet the PPOV screening criteria. Following the initial screening conducted in October 2010, MSHA issued PPOV notices at four additional mines after audits revealed those mines had not accurately reported injury data. In February 2011, MSHA proposed a rule to revise the current pattern of violations regulations. The comment period closed Aug. 1. MSHA's online PPOV monitoring tool allows operators, miners and others to determine, based on the most recent data available, how a specific mine matches up with the initial screening criteria for a potential pattern of violations. The initial screening criteria are based on enforcement data refreshed monthly. To conduct the current screening, MSHA used data available as of Sept. 30, 2011, the most recent available. In April, Bledsoe Coal Corp.'s Abner Branch Rider Mine in Leslie County, Ky., and The New West Virginia Mining Co.'s Apache Mine in McDowell County, W.Va., became the first mines in the history of the Mine Act to be subject to the full effect of POV enforcement action, and thus subject to 104(e) closure orders.

"November 30, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ilab/ilab20111130,US Department of Labor awards $10 million to combat child labor in Ethiopia,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of International Labor Affairs has awarded a $10 million cooperative agreement to World Vision to combat exploitative child labor in Ethiopia that will focus on child labor in rural areas and the traditional weaving industry. ""The United States is working with the international community to end all exploitative child labor by 2016,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""Our grant will provide increased education and awareness, and critical assistance to families and governments to help bring us closer to our goal."" The project will take a comprehensive approach in addressing exploitative child labor, in cooperation with the Ethiopian government, at the local and national levels. Funds will be used to reintegrate children into formal or non-formal education systems and to transition children of legal working age to vocational education and apprenticeship training. Vulnerable families also will be linked to income-generating opportunities that reduce reliance on child labor. Through collaboration with the University of Gondar, the grantee will raise awareness and train labor inspectors on child labor laws as well as occupational safety and health standards. Since 1995, Congress has appropriated approximately $780 million to the Labor Department to support global efforts to combat exploitative child labor. As a result, the department has rescued approximately 1.4 million children from exploitative child labor. More information on the department's efforts is available at http://www.dol.gov/ilab/ ."
"November 29, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20111129,"US Labor Department initiative on Long Island, NY, nets more than $2.3 million in back wages for 578 restaurant workers affected by labor law violations","Multiyear effort aims to protect workers, law-abiding employers against industry noncompliance WESTBURY , N.Y.  An ongoing enforcement initiative conducted by the U.S. Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division has found widespread noncompliance with the minimum wage, overtime and record-keeping provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act among full-service restaurants on Long Island. Under the initiative, the division has completed 46 investigations of pizza and pasta establishments and recovered $2,341,507 in back wages for 578 employees. In addition, the division has assessed $202,315 in civil money penalties against employers for willful and repeated FLSA violations. ""This initiative reflects the Labor Department's commitment to protecting our nation's vulnerable workers by ensuring that employers meet their responsibilities under federal law,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""The Wage and Hour Division will continue to monitor full-service restaurants and other industries in which unlawful pay practices are widespread in order to level the playing field for the many employers who abide by the law and properly pay their employees."" The Wage and Hour Division is concerned about the prevalence of unlawful pay practices in the full-service restaurant industry, such as employers paying cash wages ""off the books,"" rather than maintaining legally required employment records; paying employees a fixed salary for all hours worked, without regard for the FLSA's minimum wage and overtime requirements; and falsifying employees' time and payroll records. Investigators from the division's Long Island District Office are inspecting restaurants throughout the jurisdiction to identify patterns of minimum wage, overtime and record-keeping violations, and to remind workers of their rights under the FLSA. These inspections include thorough reviews of payroll records as well as interviews with employees to assess employer compliance with all applicable labor standards. Other strategies include surveillance of employers who may be committing violations, using penalty assessments to increase the cost of noncompliance, and coordination with local agencies and criminal enforcement authorities to combat willful violations, such as falsification of records and tax filings. Additionally, the division is actively engaging major industry representatives — such as accountants, attorneys and associations — to solicit their input on enforcement strategies and enlist their cooperation in ensuring compliance among their clients. The division also is reaching out to employers, workers, community organizations and other stakeholders to inform them of the ongoing initiative and encourage participation in promoting industrywide compliance. When violations are found, the division is using all enforcement tools available — including litigation, administrative subpoenas, civil money penalty assessments and liquidated damages — to ensure accountability and deter future violations. Based on the findings of its investigations, the division has pursued litigation against 26 local establishments, recovering more than $1,914,000 in back wages and liquidated damages for more than 300 local restaurant employees. These defendants also have been assessed more than $127,000 civil money penalties for willful and/or repeat violations of the FLSA. The FLSA provides that employers who violate the law are liable to employees for the back wages as well as an equal amount in liquidated damages. The FLSA requires that covered employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, as well as one and one-half times their regular rates for every hour they work beyond 40 per week. The law also requires employers to maintain accurate records of employees' wages, hours and other conditions of employment, and prohibits employers from retaliating against employees who exercise their rights under the law. Employers who violate the FLSA can be liable to employees for the back wages as well as an equal amount in liquidated damages.

The complaint was filed with the department's Office of Administrative Law Judges after OFCCP was unable to secure a fair resolution from Cargill Meat Solutions to pay back wages and interest to the rejected job applicants and extend job offers to at least 167 of the affected workers. OFCCP is seeking cancellation of Cargill Meat Solutions' existing government contracts and debarment from entering into future contracts until the company resolves all violations and corrects its discriminatory employment practices. ""This is an unfortunate case in which thousands of qualified workers were denied the opportunity to compete fairly for jobs in a tough economy,"" said OFCCP Director Patricia A. Shiu. ""Cargill has discriminated against vulnerable workers. OFCCP is prepared to use every tool at our disposal, including canceling a company's federal contracts when necessary, to achieve the goal of equal opportunity for workers."" OFCCP discovered the company's discriminatory practices during a scheduled review to determine its compliance with Executive Order 11246, which prohibits federal contractors from discriminating on the basis of race, national origin or sex when making hiring decisions. The investigation found that the company's selection criteria were subjectively and inconsistently applied. As a result, women were less likely to be employed in entry-level production jobs, and Asian and Pacific Islander job seekers were unfairly favored over other racial groups.

The decision resolves the Labor Department's actions against the company related to violations of the McNamara O'Hara Service Contract Act and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Investigations were conducted by the department's Wage and Hour Division and its Employee Benefits Security Administration when the company could not meet its payroll. Investigators found that the company failed to pay hundreds of employees for their last 2 1/2 weeks of work, and many employees were not paid the prevailing wage for their geographic areas or fringe benefits. The company also failed to remit employee salary deferral contributions to their 401(k) plan accounts. The settlement between the federal government and a bankruptcy trustee allows for a total recovery of $7,968,744, of which $6,951,977 was recovered for the employees' wages and cash fringe benefits. The remaining $1,016,767 was recovered for the employees' 401(k) accounts. ""I am very pleased that former USProtect employees will receive the back wages, fringe benefits and retirement assets they earned and are owed,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis.

"November 22, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20111122,MSHA announces results of October impact inspections,"ARLINGTON, Va. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration today announced that federal inspectors issued 226 citations and orders during special impact inspections conducted at eight coal mines and three metal/nonmetal mines last month. The coal mines were issued 145 citations and 18 orders, while the metal/nonmetal operations were issued 51 citations and 12 orders. These inspections, which began in force in April 2010 following the explosion at the Upper Big Branch Mine, involve mines that merit increased agency attention and enforcement due to their poor compliance history or particular compliance concerns, including high numbers of violations or closure orders; frequent hazard complaints or hotline calls; plan compliance issues; inadequate workplace examinations; a high number of accidents, injuries or illnesses; fatalities; and adverse conditions such as increased methane liberation, faulty roof conditions and inadequate ventilation. One of MSHA's most recent impact inspections was on Oct. 31 at Bledsoe Coal Corp.'s Abner Branch Rider Mine in Leslie County, Ky. Upon arrival, the inspection team captured and monitored the mine phone to prevent advance notification. Inspectors observed loose, unsupported drawrock and loose coal ribs, which can cause serious injury or death to miners. Consequently, they issued two withdrawal orders for inadequate roof and rib control. Withdrawal orders also were issued for combustible material accumulations as well as the operator's failure to conduct a pre-shift examination of the active section, which resulted in electrical equipment and cables being energized in the presence of roof control and ventilation hazards, creating a potential fire or explosion hazard. The mine operator was issued a total of five withdrawal orders and two citations. In April 2011, the Abner Branch Rider Mine became one of two mines ever successfully placed by MSHA on a pattern of violations, based on the operator's repeated significant and substantial violations of mandatory health and safety standards. The withdrawal orders issued based on last month's inspection, which require all individuals to be withdrawn from the affected area until each violation has been abated, bring the mine's total number of withdrawal orders received since April to 34. ""The conditions at the Abner Branch Rider Mine underscore the importance of adequate pre-shift examinations, which require hazards to be found and fixed to prevent miners from being harmed,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""There is no excuse for miners to be exposed to these conditions when a pre-shift inspection would have identified the hazards. I'm especially troubled that these conditions exist at a mine already on a pattern of violations."" As a second example from last month, MSHA conducted an impact inspection on Oct. 13 at Viper Coal LLC Mine No. 7 in Pike County, Ky. The inspection party arrived at the mine site and immediately seized the communication system. Eight unwarrantable failure orders and 12 citations were issued. One of the orders was issued for mining coal in excess of the 20-foot maximum cut depth stipulated in the operator's approved roof control plan. Additionally, drawrock was present throughout the working section and exposed miners to roof falls that could cause serious injury or death. Unwarrantable failure orders also were issued for failure to conduct an on-shift examination to ensure compliance with the respirable dust control parameters and for ventilation deficiencies that did not comply with the approved ventilation plan, as well as for inadequate on-shift/preshift examinations of the belt lines, which led to the buildup of combustible material. At the time of the inspection, the mine was using blowing ventilation, when the approved ventilation plan called for exhausting ventilation. This disregard for the approved plan resulted in a drastic reduction in airflow, well below the minimum required by law. Furthermore, the operator failed to maintain water sprays on the continuous mining machine to suppress dust. Since April 2010, MSHA has conducted 358 impact inspections, which have resulted in 6,383 citations, 614 orders and 22 safeguards.

"November 22, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20111122,US Labor Department enforcement initiative recovers more than $1 million in back wages for 295 New Jersey gas station workers,"Wage and Hour Division investigations found labor violations at BP and other gas stations MOUNTAINSIDE, N.J. — The U.S. Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division is conducting a multi-year enforcement initiative focusing on the gas station industry in New Jersey, where it has found consistent and widespread noncompliance with the minimum wage, overtime and record-keeping provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act. During fiscal year 2011, the division conducted 74 investigations of gas station facilities throughout the state, recovering $1,014,895 in back wages for 295 workers who were denied fair compensation for their work. Sixty-nine of the establishments investigated were BP branded. Non-BP stations whose owners also had BP stations were found to have similar violations. Common violations found include paying workers below the federal minimum wage; paying a flat salary or ""straight time"" wages for all hours worked, without regard to overtime requirements; and paying cash wages ""off the books,"" rather than maintaining accurate records of employees' wages, work hours and employment conditions, as required under the FLSA. After being notified of the violations, BP Products North America Inc. issued a letter to each of its marketers in New York and New Jersey, reminding them of their legal responsibilities under the FLSA and encouraging them to review their pay practices and ensure compliance under the law. ""Employers are legally required to pay their employees for all hours worked,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""The Labor Department's initial findings in this enforcement initiative revealed a culture of noncompliance by gas stations in New Jersey that will not be tolerated. The Wage and Hour Division will continue to monitor this industry for continued compliance."" To assess compliance with all applicable labor standards among facility owners, operators, franchisees and other business entities associated with these establishments, the Wage and Hour Division is conducting thorough inspections of payroll records and employment practices, as well as employee interviews. Other strategies include unannounced facility investigations; morning, evening and weekend surveillance of employers that might be committing violations; and involving the Labor Department's attorneys early in developing cases to pursue possible litigation. In addition, the division is conducting outreach to employer and employee associations, community organizations, government agencies, unions and other stakeholders to engage their participation in promoting industrywide compliance with federal laws. The initiative is being led by the division's Northern New Jersey District Office; telephone 908-317-8611. The FLSA requires that covered employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour as well as one and one-half times their regular rates of pay for hours worked over 40 per week. In general, ""hours worked"" includes all time an employee must be on duty, or on the employer's premises or at any other prescribed place of work, from the beginning of the first principal work activity to the end of the last principal activity of the workday. Additionally the law requires that accurate records of employees' wages, hours and other conditions of employment be maintained.

The decision resolves the Labor Department's actions against the company related to violations of the McNamara O'Hara Service Contract Act and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Investigations were conducted by the department's Wage and Hour Division and its Employee Benefits Security Administration when the company could not meet its payroll. Investigators found that the company failed to pay hundreds of employees for their last 2 1/2 weeks of work, and many employees were not paid the prevailing wage for their geographic areas or fringe benefits. The company also failed to remit employee salary deferral contributions to their 401(k) plan accounts. The settlement between the federal government and a bankruptcy trustee allows for a total recovery of $7,968,744, of which $6,951,977 was recovered for the employees' wages and cash fringe benefits. The remaining $1,016,767 was recovered for the employees' 401(k) accounts.

Proposed fines total $32,900. ""Employees must be protected against safety hazards in the workplace – not just because it is the right thing to do but because it is the law,"" said Ken Nishiyama Atha, OSHA's regional administrator in San Francisco. ""Workplace safety is critical. OSHA will remain focused on being proactive, especially when workers' safety and health are at stake."" Fifteen serious safety violations found include failing to provide training for employees working with hazardous materials, provide appropriate personal protective equipment for eyes and face, provide required forklift training and ensure that the forklift had a functioning seatbelt, and multiple electrical hazards, including exposing workers to live electrical parts. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known. Two other-than-serious safety violations were cited for failing to prepare and maintain records of work-related injuries and illnesses, including OSHA's Form 300 for work-related injuries and illnesses as well as the agency's Form 301, or its equivalent, for reporting incidents of injuries and illnesses. An other-than-serious violation is one that has a direct relationship to job safety and health, but probably would not cause death or serious physical harm. The employer has 15 business days from receipt of its citations and proposed penalties to comply, meet with OSHA's area director or contest the findings to the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. To ask questions, obtain compliance assistance, file a complaint, or report workplace hospitalizations, fatalities or situations posing imminent danger to workers, the public should call OSHA's toll-free hotline at 800-321-OSHA (6742) or the agency's Honolulu Area Office in Hawaii at 808-541-2680.

The ruling upholds a Feb. 28 decision by the department's Office of Administrative Law Judges. ""Workplace discrimination is not universal, but it is far too common — and the people who suffer most are the American workers,"" said OFCCP Director Patricia A. Shiu. ""At OFCCP, we are charged with identifying which federal contractors discriminate in their hiring and pay practices, and which are abiding by the law. We cannot serve our mission to protect workers if companies refuse to give us access to the records they promised to keep and share with us when they signed their contracts."" United Space Alliance, a spaceflight operations company and a joint venture between Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin Corp., holds contracts with NASA worth at least $8 billion dollars. In 2009, OFCCP asked for information about United Space's affirmative action program and supporting documents to conduct a scheduled compliance review. The initial review raised questions about the company's pay practices, leading OFCCP to request additional data and records in order to complete the evaluation. The company refused to provide the records or to allow OFCCP access to its premises to gather the requested information. In November 2010, the Labor Department's Office of the Solicitor filed a complaint with the department's Office of Administrative Law Judges alleging denial of access and requesting that United Space Alliance be compelled to comply with the requirements of Executive Order 11246, Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act and Section 4212 of the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act, as well as permit OFCCP access to its facility and records. Following a February 2011 hearing, an administrative law judge ruled in favor of OFCCP and issued a recommended decision and order that the company provide access to the requested compensation information within 30 days or be subject to contract suspension, cancellation and debarment. After additional administrative procedures, United Space Alliance sought review of the decision by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia under the Administrative Procedures Act. In a Nov. 14 decision, Chief Judge Royce C. Lamberth ruled in favor of OFCCP on all issues — rejecting every major argument United Space Alliance made — and ordered the contractor to provide the requested documentation. ""The [d]epartment has merely required United Space to submit data about its employee compensation,"" said Lamberth. ""Submission to such lawful investigations is the price of working as a federal contractor."" Lamberth's order will become enforceable on Nov. 28. OFCCP enforces Executive Order 11246, Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974. As amended, these three laws require those who do business with the federal government, both contractors and subcontractors, to follow the fair and reasonable standard that they not discriminate in employment on the basis of sex, race, color, religion, national origin, disability or status as a protected veteran.

"November 10, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/owcp/owcp20111110,US Department of Labor partners with National Academy of Sciences to enhance website used to assist nuclear weapons workers,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Labor's Office of Workers' Compensation Programs today announced a partnership with the National Academy of Sciences to further enhance the Site Exposure Matrices website, a tool that aids the adjudication of claims under the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act. The SEM website contains pertinent toxic substance information and scientifically established links between toxic substances and covered illnesses, derived from research recognized by medical authorities and maintained by the National Library of Medicine. Under the partnership, the NAS will convene a panel of experts to review the scientific accuracy of occupational disease links to toxic substances present at various locations within EEOICPA-covered facilities. The experts will evaluate other exposure databases to identify ways to augment disease associations. They also will evaluate the National Institutes of Health's Haz-Map database, which is an occupational toxicology information system that links jobs and hazardous tasks with occupational diseases and their symptoms, and provides information for the SEM website. The NAS will report findings and recommendations within 18 months to the Labor Department's Division of Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation, which administers the EEOICPA. Ultimately, the review will enhance the scientific foundation of the SEM website, allowing the department to better serve EEOICPA claimants. ""The partnership between the department and the NAS will make the SEM website a more effective tool in determining a link between exposure to a toxic substance and resulting illnesses,"" said DEEOIC Director Rachel Leiton. ""I am eager to see the results of the NAS review and use the information gathered to better assist the former nuclear weapons workers and families who are entitled to benefits under the EEOICPA."" The NAS was created in 1863 to address the government's urgent need for independent advice on scientific matters, and its scope was later expanded to include medicine and technology. NAS is a private, nonprofit society of elected scholars engaged in scientific and engineering research, dedicated to the advancement of science and technology for the public good. On July 31, 2001, the Labor Department began administering Part B of the EEOICPA. Part B covers current and former workers who have been diagnosed with cancer, beryllium disease or silicosis, and whose illness was caused by exposure to radiation, beryllium or silica while working directly for the U.S. Department of Energy, that department's contractors or subcontractors, a designated Atomic Weapons Employer or a beryllium vendor. Individuals or their survivors found eligible under Part B may receive a lump sum compensation payment of $150,000 and medical expenses for their covered conditions. Part E, created by an amendment to the EEOICPA on Oct. 28, 2004, and also administered by the Labor Department, provides federal compensation and medical benefits to DOE contractors and subcontractors who worked at covered facilities during a covered time period and sustained an illness as a result of exposure to toxic substances. The SEM website can be found at http://www.sem.dol.gov , and includes a user's guide on navigating the site for information. The Labor Department continually seeks new information to supplement and enhance the SEM website. Individuals can send information or comments by completing the form provided on the site, sending an email to info@dol-sem-public.com or writing by regular mail to the Site Exposure Matrices Administrator, P.O.

In 2008, a worker was trampled to death while a mob of shoppers rushed through the doors of a large store to take advantage of an after-Thanksgiving Day Black Friday sales event. The store was not using the kind of crowd management measures recommended in OSHA's fact sheet, which is available online at https://www.osha.gov/OshDoc/data_General_Facts/Crowd_Control.html . ""Crowd control is critical to preventing injuries and deaths,"" said OSHA Assistant Secretary Dr. David Michaels. ""These incidents can be prevented by adopting a crowd management plan, and this fact sheet provides retail employers with guidelines for avoiding injuries during the holiday shopping season."" The fact sheet provides employers with recommended elements for crowd management plans. Plans should include having trained security personnel or police officers on-site, setting up barricades or rope lines for pedestrians and crowd control well in advance of customers arriving at the store, making sure that barricades are set up so that the customers' line does not start right at the entrance of the store, having emergency procedures in place that address potential dangers, and having security personnel or customer service representatives explain approach and entrance procedures to the arriving public. OSHA also recommends not allowing additional customers to enter the store when it reaches its maximum occupancy level and not blocking or locking exit doors. Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. OSHA's role is to ensure these conditions for America's working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education and assistance.

The incidence rate for health care support workers increased 6 percent to 283 cases per 10,000 full-time workers, almost 2 1/2 times the rate for all private and public sector workers at 118 cases per 10,000 full-time workers. The rate among nursing aides, orderlies and attendants rose 7 percent, to 489 per 10,000 workers. Additionally, the rate of musculoskeletal disorder cases with days away from work for nursing aides, orderlies and attendants increased 10 percent to a rate of 249 cases per 10,000 workers. Assistant Secretary for the department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration Dr. David Michaels issued the following statement in response: ""It is unacceptable that the workers who have dedicated their lives to caring for our loved ones when they are sick are the very same workers who face the highest risk of work-related injury and illness. These injuries can end up destroying a family's emotional and financial security. While workplace injuries, illnesses and fatalities take an enormous toll on this nation's economy – the toll on injured workers and their families is intolerable. ""The rates of injuries and illnesses among hospital and health care workers underscore OSHA's concern about the safety and health of these workers.

"November 8, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20111108,Administrative Law Judge upholds citations issued by MSHA to California quarry,"ARLINGTON, Va. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration announced today that an Administrative Law Judge with the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission has upheld citations issued last May to Connolly-Pacific Co.'s Pebbly Beach Quarry, located on Catalina Island, Calif. The citations have now been appealed to the Commission. On May 24, MSHA issued three citations to the mine operator for failing to properly maintain its highwall, remedy hazards associated with the highwall and barricade the dangerous area to prevent access. An imminent danger order was issued, requiring the withdrawal of miners working under a highwall after a loader operator was observed mucking out a pile of material where loose material and overhanging rocks were observed near the crest. There also was evidence of recent work at the other end of a jagged highwall, with cracked and overhanging rocks in the working face. In an expedited hearing requested by the mine operator, Connolly-Pacific Co. was charged with not maintaining its 300-foot highwall in a stable condition. Benches generally are placed above the working area to ""catch"" and help control rocks or materials that are rolling or falling from the highwall. Scaling removes loose or hanging rocks and material before they fall. Pebbly Beach Quarry used neither method. In her decision, Administrative Law Judge Margaret A. Miller found that loader operators were exposed daily to the hazards of falling rocks because there were no benches above the working area to catch them, and no equipment with sufficient reach to scale or remove loose rocks before they fell. Blasters working on foot at the toe of the highwall placing blasts and drilling also were exposed to the hazards. Miller also found that there was an imminent danger of rock falls because of their unpredictability, that they could reasonably be expected to occur within a short period of time and that they could result in serious or fatal injury. She credited the inspector's discretion in his observation of the conditions and the operator's failure to conform to the most basic methods of industry highwall practice. ""We appreciate Judge Miller's decision upholding MSHA's citations – in particular, the imminent danger order withdrawing miners from a potentially hazardous environment,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""Unstable highwalls can be extremely dangerous. Just two weeks ago, two miners were killed when a highwall failed at a Kentucky coal mine."" The penalty for each citation was assessed at $555. Miller increased the penalty to $1,000 for the citation associated with failure to maintain highwall stability, reduced the penalty for failing to correct highwall hazards to $500 and increased the penalty for failing to barricade the dangerous area to $1,000."

These training sessions are part of the division's multi-year enforcement initiative aimed at strengthening compliance in Florida's agricultural industry. Topics will include no-cost housing and transportation arrangements, employee work hours and wage rates, and record-keeping requirements. A special session during the trainings will include a discussion on ways to improve vehicle safety when transporting agricultural workers. The first training will be held on Monday, Dec. 5, at 5:30 p.m. EST at South Florida Community College — DeSoto Campus, located at 2251 Turner Ave. NE, Arcadia, ZIP code 34266. On Tuesday, Dec. 6, the same training will be held at 5:30 p.m. EST at South Florida Community College — Highlands Campus, located at 600 W. College Drive, Avon Park, ZIP code 33825. On Wednesday, Dec. 7, the training will be presented at 5:30 p.m. EST at the Florida Strawberry Growers Association Education and Event Center, located at 13138 Lewis Gallagher Road, Dover, ZIP code 33527.

""The Labor Department is committed to ensuring that agricultural employers and farm labor contractors understand their responsibilities under federal labor laws,"" said James Schmidt, director of the Wage and Hour Division's District Office in Tampa. ""The goal is to protect agricultural workers who are often denied the pay legally guaranteed to them and make sure that they receive all of the protections provided by federal labor law, while ensuring that law-abiding agriculture employers are not placed at a competitive disadvantage for playing by the rules and paying fair wages."" Virtually all employees engaged in agriculture are covered by federal law because they produce goods for interstate commerce. Most agricultural employers, agricultural associations and farm labor contractors are subject to the MSPA, which protects migrant and seasonal agricultural workers by establishing employment standards related to wages, housing, transportation, disclosures and record keeping. The MSPA also requires farm labor contractors to register with the Department of Labor. A fact sheet on the MSPA is available at http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs49.pdf .

"November 4, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20111104,Statement by Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis on October employment numbers,"WASHINGTON – Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis today issued the following statement on the October 2011 Employment Situation report released today: ""Our nation's labor market posted stable growth in the month of October. The economy added 104,000 private sector jobs last month, and we also added 102,000 more jobs than had previously been reported in August and September. The unemployment rate dropped to 9 percent, its lowest level in six months. ""The number of long-term unemployed – defined as Americans out of work for 27 weeks or more – fell by 366,000 in October, the biggest drop since 1948. Additionally, the jobless rate for African-Americans dropped a percentage point to 15.1 percent, its lowest level since August 2009. ""We've now created 2.8 million jobs over 20 consecutive months of private sector growth, including more than 1 million jobs this year alone. GDP growth in the third quarter was 2.5 percent – the fastest rate in over a year and nearly twice that of the previous quarter. Businesses reported significantly fewer layoffs in October. Consumer and business spending are both up, reflecting Americans' increased confidence in our recovery progress. ""Unfortunately, we continue to see job losses in government and construction, both areas where passage of the American Jobs Act would have a direct and immediate effect on job creation. Overall, non-farm payroll added 80,000 jobs in October, reflecting the loss of 24,000 government jobs and 20,000 jobs in construction. Last week, the Senate voted down provisions of the American Jobs Act that would have helped keep teachers, police officers and firefighters on the job. This week, the Senate voted down a common-sense infrastructure bill that would have put hundreds of thousands of construction workers back on the job. We cannot allow political partisanship to hamper the vital functions of our communities. ""The policies this administration has pursued have added jobs back into the economy, but the pace of our recovery continues to be influenced by the failure of Congress to pass legislation to put Americans back to work. However, even in the absence of action by Congress, job growth since April has averaged 90,000 jobs, compared to the 11,000 monthly average during the Bush administration."""

"November 3, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/owcp/owcp20111103,Federal appeals court upholds survivors right to automatic benefits under Black Lung Benefits Act,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Labor's Office of Workers' Compensation Programs has successfully defended a recent amendment to the Black Lung Benefits Act contained in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit held in ""B & G Construction Co. v. Campbell and Director, Office of Workers' Comp. Programs"" that the amendment is constitutional and provides benefits to certain survivors of miners who were entitled to benefits at the time of their deaths. ""This ruling supports our administration of the Byrd amendments in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,"" said OWCP Acting Director Gary A. Steinberg. ""We are committed to providing the benefits that claimants are entitled to under the law — benefits that so many workers and families depend on when black lung has taken away their health and livelihoods."" The Black Lung Benefits Act provides compensation to miners totally disabled by pneumoconiosis, commonly called black lung disease, and their eligible survivors. From 1982 until the PPACA amendment was enacted on March 23, 2010, a survivor, usually the miner's spouse, had to prove that pneumoconiosis caused the miner's death to be entitled to benefits, even if the miner was receiving benefits when he died. But the 3rd Circuit held that the PPACA amendment automatically continues benefits to a miner's eligible survivors if the miner was entitled to benefits prior to death. The court rejected B & G's contention that the amendment is unconstitutional under the due process and takings clauses of the Fifth Amendment. The amendment applies to claims filed after Jan. 1, 2005, that were pending on or after March 23, 2010. In this case, the deceased miner had worked for B & G for more than 16 years. Because the miner was totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis, he received disability benefits until his death in 2005. Under the PPACA amendment, the court ruled that his surviving spouse is automatically entitled to continuing benefits. The Office of Workers' Compensation Programs administers several disability benefit programs that cover federal workers, nuclear weapons workers, coal miners, longshore and harbor workers, and civilian contractors of the federal government who work overseas. These programs provide a variety of medical benefits, as well as wage replacement, vocational rehabilitation and other services. Benefits also may be paid to eligible dependents or survivors.

"November 2, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20111102-0,"US Department of Labors OSHA cites Illinois pet food production and packaging company for 23 health and safety violations; fines exceed $750,000","All-Feed Processing & Packaging failed to protect workers from dust and noise exposure PEORIA , Ill. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration has cited All-Feed Processing & Packaging Inc., headquartered in Alpha, for 23 safety and health violations at its pet food production and packaging facility in Galva, including willful violations of OSHA's air contaminant, respiratory protection and hearing conservation standards. Some violations were cited under OSHA's ""general duty"" clause, including failing to provide appropriate fire and explosion protection in locations where concentrations of combustible dust existed. Proposed fines total $758,450. ""Even after a powerful dust explosion and fire at this facility in 2009, along with a number of citations previously issued for similar conditions, All-Feed Processing & Packaging fails to comply with safety and health requirements,"" said OSHA Assistant Secretary Dr. David Michaels. ""By showing a blatant disregard for worker safety and health, this employer continues to expose workers to deadly hazards."" OSHA issued nine per-instance willful citations for failing to mandate the use of respirators for six workers exposed to dust in excess of the permissible exposure limits; and failing to protect three dust collection units, which collect combustible dust such as starch, potato base, cellulose fiber and pea protein, from fire and explosion hazards. Additionally, four single-instance willful citations were issued for requiring employees to work in areas where they were exposed to total dust in excess of permissible limits, together with failing to implement adequate engineering controls when employees were so exposed; failing to administer a continuing and effective hearing conservation program for employees exposed to excessive noise; failing to ensure the safe use, wiring and installation of equipment in hazardous locations; and allowing the use of liquid propane-powered industrial trucks in atmospheres where combustible dust may be ignited. A willful violation is one committed with intentional knowing or voluntary disregard for the law's requirements, or with plain indifference to worker safety and health. Proposed fines for the 13 willful violations total $700,700. Three repeat safety violations were cited for failing to ensure that operators of powered industrial trucks had completed training and were evaluated on their skills, have the load rating affixed to lifting devices and post danger signs to warn exposed employees of potential dangers posed by work spaces involving hazardous conditions. One repeat health violation was cited for failing to post safety instruction signs indicating the presence of combustible dust. A repeat violation exists when an employer previously has been cited for the same or a similar violation of a standard, regulation, rule or order at any other facility in federal enforcement states within the last five years. The company was cited for similar hazards in 2009. Proposed fines for the four repeat violations total $50,050. One serious safety violation, with a proposed fine of $3,850, was cited for failing to have a written certification indicating that all hazards in the permit-required confined space had been eliminated. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazardous condition about which the employer knew or should have known. All-Feed Processing & Packaging also was cited for five other-than-serious violations, with proposed fines of $3,850, for failing to record work-related injuries and illness as required on the OSHA 300 log. An other-than-serious violation is one that has a direct relationship to job safety and health, but probably would not cause death or serious physical harm. Prior to this inspection, which was opened in May after OSHA procured a warrant to conduct the inspection, All-Feed Processing & Packaging had been inspected by OSHA 10 times since 2000, resulting in citations and significant proposed penalties on five occasions. Those citations encompassed a total of 17 willful, 44 serious, five repeat and 10 other-than-serious violations, many of which related to failing to monitor and limit employees' exposure to hazardous dust. The workers' compensation carrier insuring All-Feed Processing & Packaging is Benchmark Insurance Co. in Shawnee Mission, Kan. Workers' compensation is a form of insurance that provides wage replacement and medical benefits for an employee who has a job-related injury or disease, in exchange for relinquishment of the employee's right to sue his or her employer for negligence. Each state has its own workers' compensation law. Illinois' law first took effect in 1912 and requires employers to provide workers' compensation insurance for almost every person who is hired, injured or whose employment is localized in Illinois. The company has been placed in OSHA's Severe Violator Enforcement Program, which focuses enforcement resources on employers with a history of safety violations that endanger workers by demonstrating indifference to their responsibilities under the law. The program includes mandatory OSHA follow-up inspections, and inspections of other work sites of the same employer where similar hazards and deficiencies may be present. All-Feed Processing & Packaging was placed in the program due to its previous violations as well as the per-instance violations cited during both the current and a January 2011 inspection.

"November 2, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20111102,US Department of Labors OSHA announces interim final rules and invites public comment on Sarbanes-Oxley whistleblower procedures,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration will publish interim final rules in the Nov. 3 Federal Register that revise the regulations governing whistleblower complaints filed under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The act protects employees of publicly traded companies and their subsidiaries, and of certain other employers, from retaliation for reporting mail fraud, wire fraud, bank fraud, securities fraud, violations of SEC rules or regulations, or violations of any provision of federal law relating to fraud against shareholders. OSHA is requesting public comment on the interim final rule. ""Fraudulent practices by publicly held corporations have contributed to the economic difficulties currently facing our nation,"" said OSHA Assistant Secretary Dr. David Michaels. ""The best way to prevent this from happening in the future is to ensure that workers feel free to blow the whistle on corrupt corporate practices without fear of retaliation, and OSHA is committed to protecting the rights of those workers to speak out."" The whistleblower protection provisions of SOX were amended by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 to clarify that subsidiaries of publicly traded companies are covered employers under the statute, and to add nationally recognized statistical rating organizations as covered employers. The 2010 amendments to SOX also extended the statute of limitations for filing a complaint from 90 to 180 days, among other changes. The new interim final rules implement these changes and aim to improve OSHA's procedures for handling complaints under SOX. Among the changes to improve the complaint filing process, the revised rules will allow SOX complainants to file complaints orally and in any language, and enhance the sharing of information between parties throughout the investigation. ""The ability of workers to speak out and exercise their legal rights without fear of retaliation is crucial to many of the legal protections and safeguards that all Americans value,"" said Dr. Michaels. ""In a continuing effort to improve the Whistleblower Protection Program and make the filing process easier, the rules have been updated to reflect the changes required by the statute.""

"November 1, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20111101,"East Los Angeles community hospital executives ordered to repay $600,000 to employee retirement plan, following US Labor Department investigation","LOS ANGELES – Two former corporate officers of an East Los Angeles community hospital have been ordered to repay $600,692 plus post-judgment interest to the ElaStar Community Hospital Retirement Savings Plan, according to the terms of a consent judgment and order filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California’s Southern Division. The judgment and order resolve a lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Labor against USA Star Healthcare Group–East Los Angeles, doing business as ElaStar Community Hospital, as well as officers Andrea Kofl and Richard Yardley. At the time of the violations, Kofl and Yardley were the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, respectively, of ElaStar, as well as shareholders of its parent company. In addition to restoring the funds, Kofl and Yardley must pay a 20 percent penalty. Both have been removed as plan fiduciaries and are permanently barred from serving as service providers or fiduciaries to any plan covered by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The court also appointed Fiduciary Experts LLC of San Diego as an independent fiduciary to manage and wind down the plan, and distribute plan assets to eligible participants and beneficiaries. “Retirement savings are a vital part of ensuring a steady income after we leave the workforce, and that’s why they are given special legal protections,” said Phyllis C. Borzi, assistant secretary of the Labor Department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration. “Unfortunately, the individuals entrusted with protecting this plan violated those safeguards. However, our rigorous enforcement of the law in this case will help to restore the money that participants lost in the hospital’s plan.” The department’s suit alleged that from Nov. 5, 2002, through Aug. 6, 2004, the defendants caused ElaStar Community Hospital to fail to remit $412,886.63 in contributions and participant loan payments to the plan that had been withheld from employees’ paychecks. Instead, the defendants retained and comingled the money in other hospital accounts. The defendants also failed to forward employee contributions and participant loan payments to the plan in a timely manner, resulting in deposits up to 301 days late. Nearly 200 former workers and beneficiaries are enrolled in the now-bankrupt hospital’s retirement plan. “These employees believed they were saving some of their wages for retirement, and expected the defendants to hold that money in trust,” said Crisanta Johnson, EBSA’s regional director in Los Angeles. “We are pleased that as a result of this action, funds will be returned to employees who set their money aside.” This case is part of EBSA’s national enforcement initiative to safeguard workers’ contributions to 401(k) and health benefit plans. The case was investigated by EBSA’s Los Angeles Regional Office and litigated by the department’s regional solicitor in San Francisco. Employers and workers can contact EBSA at 626-229-1000 or toll-free at 866-444-3272 for help with problems relating to private sector pension and health plans.

The letter states that information required by and that complies with the fee disclosure regulation that is provided by a plan administrator, or designee, to plan participants or beneficiaries will be treated as a communication that satisfies the requirements of Rule 482. The letter's intent is to resolve concerns about potential differences between the department's participant disclosure requirements and the SEC rules on advertising that may apply to plan investment options. ""This no-action letter is significant for many reasons, but primarily because it will help 401(k) plans and service providers understand what is expected of them under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and the advertising rules under securities law,"" said EBSA Assistant Secretary Phyllis C. Borzi. ""This ultimately will reduce the cost of regulatory compliance for these plans, which will benefit America's workers. This letter exemplifies the close and sustained coordination between our agency and the SEC, not only on this letter, but on many other matters affecting retirement plans and their financial service providers."" On Oct. 20, 2010, EBSA published the participant-level fee disclosure regulation. It requires many retirement savings plans, such as 401(k) plans, to disclose information about the plan's investment alternatives. This includes fee and performance information, which must be provided to participants and beneficiaries in cases where they have the ability to direct the investment of their individual accounts. Most plans will be required to furnish the first set of disclosures under this regulation by May 31, 2012. EBSA and SEC staff have been coordinating on the no-action letter since pre-publication of the final rule in 2010 to address concerns raised by plan representatives and their financial service providers regarding their obligations under ERISA and Rule 482. Those efforts culminated in the Oct. 26, 2011, no-action letter from the SEC's Office of the Chief Counsel, Division of Investment Management.

"October 26, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20111026,MSHA announces results of September impact inspections,"ARLINGTON, Va. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration today announced that federal inspectors issued 374 citations, orders and safeguards during special impact inspections conducted at 18 coal mines and two metal/nonmetal mines last month. The coal mines were issued 292 citations, 28 orders and one safeguard, while the metal/nonmetal operations were issued 52 citations and one order. Special impact inspections, which began in force in April 2010 following the explosion at Upper Big Branch Mine, involve mines that merit increased agency attention and enforcement due to their poor compliance history or particular compliance concerns, including high numbers of violations or closure orders; indications of operator tactics, such as advance notification of inspections that prevent inspectors from observing violations; frequent hazard complaints or hotline calls; plan compliance issues; inadequate workplace examinations; a high number of accidents, injuries or illnesses; fatalities; and adverse conditions, such as increased methane liberation, faulty roof conditions and inadequate ventilation. As an example from last month's inspections, an impact inspection was conducted on Sept. 23 during the second shift at D & C Mining Corp.'s underground coal mine in Harlan County, Ky. Inspectors arrived at the mine and immediately captured and monitored the mine phone to prevent advance notification of their presence. The inspection resulted in seven 104(d)(2) withdrawal orders, one 107(a) imminent danger order and 11 104(a) citations, of which 16 were designated significant and substantial. The imminent danger order was issued when the inspection team found a cigarette lighter near the continuous mining machine, marking the second time since February that smoking articles were found underground at this mine. This condition provided an ignition source in the presence of combustible materials, loose coal and coal dust accumulations in an area with inadequate rock dust to prevent an explosion. The September impact inspection was the sixth conducted at the mine since April 2010. Inspectors wrote two of the withdrawal orders for inadequate roof and rib supports at the face area of the mine where miners normally work and travel during their shift. Violations included loose, unsupported drawrock, as well as wide roof and rib bolt spacing, all of which created the potential for roof and rib collapses. Additionally, inspectors found inadequate rock dusting, use of a non-permissible cap lamp, accumulations of combustible material, an inadequate smoke search program, inadequate pre-shift examinations, improperly working parking brakes on mobile equipment, nonworking self-contained self-rescuer units, a poorly maintained roof drill dust collection system and inadequate illumination on the mine surface areas. ""The closure order is still one of the most effective tools inspectors have to bring about compliance, even during impact inspections,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""We will not hesitate to use this and other enforcement tools to protect the nation's miners."" As a second example, MSHA conducted an impact inspection Sept. 12 to 16 at Robinson Nevada Mining Co.'s Robinson Operation, a large surface copper mine located in White Pine County, Nev. MSHA issued 34 citations during the inspection, including 25 citations to the mine operator and nine to independent contractors working on mine property. Among the hazards inspectors cited were inadequate testing of electrical grounding systems, and unattended pieces of mobile equipment that were left with engines running and parked on a grade without properly blocking the wheels. In addition, approximately 30 compressed gas cylinders were stored without caps to prevent injury to the valves which, if damaged, could pose an explosion risk. Inspectors also found an open excavation hole that was not supported to prevent material from falling onto workers. Since April 2010, MSHA has conducted 347 impact inspections, which have resulted in 6,187 citations, 584 orders and 22 safeguards.

Purcell has upheld civil money penalties of $100,000 assessed by the U.S. Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division against Progressive Protein LLC of Omaha, Neb., after a 17-year-old worker was killed in May 2009 at the company's Omaha meat rendering plant. The minor was operating a forklift and working at the plant in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act's child labor provisions. This was the first hearing conducted in the nation regarding the Wage and Hour Division's Child Labor Enhanced Penalty Program, as established under the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, which allows the Labor Department to assess greater penalties in cases involving violations of child labor provisions that cause the death or serious injury of a minor. ""We are gratified that the department's use of the tools established under the Genetic Information and Nondiscrimination Act was upheld,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""The Department of Labor is committed to enforcing America's child labor laws to protect this vulnerable group from workplace harm, and this decision will help us further that mission."" The Labor Department issued penalties to Progressive Protein in February 2010 following its investigation into the minor's death, which occurred when the forklift he was operating overturned. Progressive Protein did not verify the age of the worker prior to employing him even though the investigation determined the company was aware that he was a high school student. The company contested the department's findings and requested a hearing before an administrative law judge. Progressive Protein also was cited in August 2009 by the Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration for four violations carrying proposed penalties of $8,500, following an inspection that was conducted as a result of the fatality. The violations included insufficient training for and inadequate supervision of powered industrial truck operators-in-training, the lack of seat belt use, deficient energy control procedures and improper record keeping. The FLSA establishes a minimum age of 18 for those nonagricultural occupations that the secretary of labor finds and declares to be particularly hazardous for 16- and 17-year-old workers, or detrimental to their health or well-being. The company was cited for violations of Hazardous Occupations Order No. 7, allowing a minor to operate a power-driven hoisting apparatus, as well as Hazardous Occupations Order No. 10, permitting a minor to work in or about a meat rendering facility. To learn more about the FLSA's requirements, call the Wage and Hour Division's toll-free hotline at 866-4US-WAGE (487-9243).

An investigation by officials from the Wage and Hour Division's Dallas District Office found that the company failed to pay employees for work performed prior to clocking in at the start of their scheduled shifts, such as booting up a computer, opening programs required to assist customers and reading pertinent emails. Consequently, the employees did not receive at least the minimum wage for this time, as required by the FLSA. Additionally, because the time was not included in employees' total hours worked, which is used to calculate overtime wages, they did not receive the correct overtime rate of pay. Finally, the employer failed to maintain the required records. ""This company profited by not paying its customer care workers for hours spent conducting pre-shift work,"" said Cynthia Watson, regional administrator for the Wage and Hour Division in the Southwest. ""We look at big companies with a multitude of resources, such as Hilton Reservations Worldwide, as businesses that can model what it means to be a good employer. For that reason, we are pleased that the company has made the necessary changes to comply with the law and pay its workers all the wages they have earned."" A total of $456,343 is due to 1,443 reservation and customer care workers at the Carrollton location; $213,314 is due to 1,012 employees in Tampa, Fla.; $30,370 is due to 130 workers in Hazelton, Pa.; and $15,480 is due to 60 workers in Streator, Ill. Hilton Reservations Worldwide, which provides telephone reservation services for the Hilton Worldwide chain of hotels and resorts, has agreed to fully comply with the FLSA in the future. Payment of the back wages is ongoing. The FLSA requires that covered employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 for all hours worked, plus time and one-half their regular rates of pay, including commissions, bonuses and incentive pay, for hours worked beyond 40 per week. Employers also are required to maintain accurate time and payroll records.

"October 25, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/olms/olms20111025,US Department of Labor publishes final rule on reports filed by union officials,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Labor's Office of Labor-Management Standards will publish a final rule revising Form LM-30, the Labor Organization Officer and Employee Report, in the Federal Register on Oct. 26. The new rule promotes transparency by requiring union officials to disclose payments and interests that involve actual or likely conflicts between the official's personal financial interests and his or her duties to the union. The department intends to engage in compliance assistance and enforcement efforts to ensure proper reporting by union officials. The new rule avoids unnecessary intrusions into labor-management relations by removing requirements to report transactions that create no actual or likely conflicts of interest. The rule announced today reverses one published in 2007 that expanded the length and complexity of the LM-30, but did not lead to additional useful information being reported by union officials. The new rule becomes effective on Nov. 25 and applies to reports required by union officials with fiscal years beginning on or after Jan. 1, 2012. For fiscal years beginning before that date, OLMS will accept this new form, the 2007 Form LM-30 or the original, pre-2007 Form LM-30. A copy of the revised Form LM-30 is available at http://www.dol.gov/olms/regs/compliance/GPEA_Forms/blanklmforms.htm#FLM30 . The department established Form LM-30 in 1963 pursuant to Section 202 of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act to make public any actual or likely conflicts between union officials' personal interests and their obligations to the union and its members. These conflicts concern payments, interests and transactions involving the employers whose employees the union represents or actively seeks to represent; vendors and service providers to such employers, the official's union or the union's trust; and other employers from which a payment could create a conflict. The final rule can be viewed at http://s.dol.gov/JD."

The agreement resolves a formal discrimination complaint that MSHA filed in court on behalf of the employee, after the agency's investigation determined that the company fired the employee in retaliation for reporting safety concerns. ""Federal law and safe mining practices require that employees be free to file a complaint without fear of retaliation when they see unsafe working conditions,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""This settlement reaffirms those principles."" Approved by the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission's Office of Administrative Law Judges, the settlement requires the company to pay an undisclosed amount in compensation to the employee and provide training within 120 days of the approval of the settlement to GCR employees on the applicable sections of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, the Occupational Safety and Health Act and the Surface Transportation Assistance Act. GCR agreed not to retaliate against the employee and will not disclose information related to this action to any prospective employer. The company also will delete all references to the circumstances involved in this matter from the worker's employment records and provide a neutral job reference. GCR Tire Centers is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bridgestone Americas Tire Operations, the world's largest tire and rubber company. Under Section 105(c) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, miners, representatives of miners and applicants for employment are protected from retaliation for engaging in safety and/or health-related activities, such as identifying hazards, asking for MSHA inspections, or refusing to engage in an unsafe act.

Proposed penalties total $54,600. ""This company jeopardized the safety and health of its workers by exposing them to respiratory and combustible dust hazards,"" said David Doucet, director of OSHA's Houston North Area Office. ""Long-term exposure to dust can lead to disabling illnesses."" OSHA's Houston North Area Office conducted its inspection at the company's facility on Farm to Market 529 where workers handle various powders and liquids in the production of lubricating agents to improve flow in pipelines. The serious violations involve failing to adequately control combustible dust; failing to use noncombustible ventilation ducts; failing to electrically ground bulk container bags while being emptied; failing to keep work and storage areas clean of combustible dust; failing to develop, implement and train employees in a respiratory protection program; failing to medically evaluate and fit-test employees for respiratory protection; and failing to provide warning signs to alert employees of the hazards of combustible dust. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known. The other-than-serious violations involve failing to use the proper filter cartridge on respirators and failing to list hazardous chemicals used in the workplace. An other-than-serious violation is one that has a direct relationship to job safety and health but probably would not cause death or serious physical harm. The company, which employs approximately 30 workers, has 15 business days from receipt of the citations to comply, request an informal conference with OSHA's area director in Houston, or contest the citations and penalties before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.

Proposed penalties total $57,000. ""Employers are responsible for protecting workers from injuries and illnesses,"" said Jack Rector, OSHA's area director in Fort Worth. ""It is very fortunate that no one was hurt at this facility."" OSHA's Fort Worth Area Office initiated its inspection as part of OSHA's emphasis program for grain handling facilities. The investigation found that Horizon Milling exposed workers to unsafe working conditions while involved in shipping and receiving, flour blending, maintenance and other operations at the company's facility on East Industrial Boulevard. The serious violations include failing to enclose or guard sprockets and chains; guard pulleys 7 feet or less from the floor; ensure coverings were provided for panel, electrical pull and junction boxes; guard or enclose vertical belts and rotating shafts; provide strain relief on electrical circuits; ensure that exit access areas are at least the required 28 inches in width; provide at least two means of escape from galleries or bin decks; and install a mid-rail in the overhead storage location. A serious violation is one in which there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known. Horizon Milling, which employs about 85 workers at its Saginaw facility, has 15 business days from receipt of citations to comply, request an informal conference with OSHA's area director in Fort Worth or contest the citations and proposed penalties before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.

""The law is clear,"" said OFCCP Director Patricia A. Shiu. ""Discrimination will not be tolerated by employers who profit from lucrative government contracts. We are committed to protecting workers from discrimination, including the hundreds of qualified white, black, Asian and female job seekers involved in this case."" OFCCP conducted scheduled compliance reviews of both plants, which found that the company had violated Executive Order 11246 by failing to meet its obligations as a federal contractor to ensure that qualified job applicants receive equal consideration for employment without regard to their sex, race, color, religion or national origin. Caviness holds contracts with the U.S. Department of Agriculture in excess of $20 million. Under the conciliation agreement, Amarillo-based Caviness Beef Packers will pay $600,000 to the 746 identified class members, including back wages and interest, and extend at least 81 offers of employment as positions become available. Additionally, the company agreed to revise its selection process for production positions to avoid future violations of its equal employment opportunity obligations. In addition to Executive Order 11246, OFCCP's legal authority exists under Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974. As amended, these three laws hold those who do business with the federal government, both contractors and subcontractors, to the fair and reasonable standard that they not discriminate in employment on the basis of sex, race, color, religion, national origin, disability or status as a protected veteran.

Proposed penalties total $54,600. ""This company jeopardized the safety and health of its workers by exposing them to respiratory and combustible dust hazards,"" said David Doucet, director of OSHA's Houston North Area Office. ""Long-term exposure to dust can lead to disabling illnesses."" OSHA's Houston North Area Office conducted its inspection at the company's facility on Farm to Market 529 where workers handle various powders and liquids in the production of lubricating agents to improve flow in pipelines. The serious violations involve failing to adequately control combustible dust; failing to use noncombustible ventilation ducts; failing to electrically ground bulk container bags while being emptied; failing to keep work and storage areas clean of combustible dust; failing to develop, implement and train employees in a respiratory protection program; failing to medically evaluate and fit-test employees for respiratory protection; and failing to provide warning signs to alert employees of the hazards of combustible dust. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known. The other-than-serious violations involve failing to use the proper filter cartridge on respirators and failing to list hazardous chemicals used in the workplace. An other-than-serious violation is one that has a direct relationship to job safety and health but probably would not cause death or serious physical harm. The company, which employs approximately 30 workers, has 15 business days from receipt of the citations to comply, request an informal conference with OSHA's area director in Houston, or contest the citations and penalties before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.

Two failure-to-abate notices also were issued because the company had not corrected employee respiratory hazards cited at the Hastings location. Proposed fines total $169,260. The failure-to-abate notices with $63,000 in fines were issued for failing to provide fit-testing and medical evaluations for employees who were required to wear respirators to be protected from hazardous airborne chemical vapors and dust. A failure-to-abate notice applies to a condition, hazard or practice found uncorrected upon re-inspection that is the same for which the employer was originally cited. ""America's Fiberglass Animals was cited last year for exposing employees to serious chemical hazards that can affect the respiratory system, as well as for other dangerous conditions, and failed to correct those hazards,"" said Charles E. Adkins, OSHA's regional administrator in Kansas City, Mo. ""All employers must take the necessary steps to eliminate hazards from the workplace."" The repeat violations with $73,920 in fines address hazards associated with the use of unrated electrical systems and equipment in a location where combustible dust accumulated, the lack of mechanical ventilation and the presence of ignition sources inside an area where flammable liquids were sprayed, the storage of flammable liquids in the vicinity of a spray area, and the lack of a respirator program for employees who were required to wear respirators to protect them from exposure to hazardous airborne chemicals. A repeat violation exists when an employer previously has been cited for the same or a similar violation of a standard, regulation, rule or order at any other facility in federal enforcement states within the last five years. The company was cited in July 2010 for the repeat and failure-to-abate violations at its Hastings facility. The serious violations with $32,340 in fines involve improperly storing flammable chemicals; allowing hazardous materials to accumulate in a spray area; spraying organic peroxides and dual component resins outside of a spray booth; failing to use non-sparking tools in areas where hazardous chemicals were stored, mixed and applied; allowing employees to consume food and beverages in areas exposed to toxic materials; and failing to train workers on the use of fire extinguishers and how to detect the presence of hazardous chemicals.

"October 19, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20111019,US Labor Department's MSHA warns mining industry about dangers of cold weather,"Miners, mine operators urged to ""knock out"" winter hazards ARLINGTON, Va. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration has launched its annual ""Winter Alert"" campaign to call attention to the dangers caused by cold weather. Statistics show that coal-mine explosions occur most often during the colder months, October through March. ""As we near the winter season, when the potential for mine explosions is greater, and colder weather creates some drastic changes in the mining workplace, mine operators need to take additional precautions to protect miners,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""In view of this, MSHA is distributing important information to the mining industry about the preventive steps to be taken to avoid accidents."" Low barometric pressure and low humidity, combined with the seasonal drying of many areas in underground coal mines, have been key factors in past mine explosions. Colder weather brings other potential hazards, such as limited visibility, icy haulage roads and walkways, and freezing and thawing of highwalls at surface mines. This year, MSHA encourages miners and mine operators to ""Knock Out the Risk"" that winter weather brings by taking specific measures to avoid workplace hazards: remove snow and ice in travel ways, apply salt and sand where needed, and frequently examine highwalls for stability. In underground coal mines, mine operators should ensure that there is adequate ventilation in the mine, apply liberal amounts of rock dust, conduct frequent and thorough examinations, and be familiar with emergency procedures that prevent coal-mine ignitions and explosions. During normal inspections, MSHA inspectors will distribute posters, hard-hat stickers and pocket cards with the ""Knock Out the Risk"" theme to miners and mine operators."

"October 18, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20111018-0,Statement from Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis on reported decline in workplace injuries and illnesses,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics today announced that nonfatal workplace injuries and illnesses among private industry employers declined in 2010 to a rate of 3.5 cases per 100 equivalent full-time workers, down from a total case rate of 3.6 in 2009. Nearly 3.1 million injuries and illnesses were reported among private sector industry employers in 2010, down from 3.3 million reported in 2009. Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis issued the following statement: ""We are encouraged by the reported decline in incidence rates for workplace injuries and illnesses, which is reflective of the joint effort of government, business, unions and other organizations. Nevertheless, 3.1 million injuries and illnesses in the workplace is too high. Serious injuries and illnesses can knock a working family out of the middle class. Workers should not have to sacrifice their health and safety to earn a paycheck. ""We remain concerned that more workers are injured in the health care and social assistance industry sector than in any other, including construction and manufacturing, and this group of workers had one of the highest rates of injuries and illness at 5.2 cases for every 100 workers. The Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration will continue to work with employers, workers and unions in this industry to reduce these risks. ""Illness and injury rates for public sector workers also continue to be alarmingly high at 5.7 cases for every 100 workers, which is more than 60 percent higher than the private sector rate. We must continue to work with state and local governments to ensure the safety of our public employees. ""A report like this also highlights the importance of accurate record keeping. Employers must know what injuries and illnesses are occurring in their workplaces in order to identify and correct systemic issues that put their workers at risk. We are concerned with poor record-keeping practices and programs that discourage workers from reporting injuries and illnesses. That's why OSHA is working hard to ensure the completeness and accuracy of these data, which are compiled by the nation's employers. ""As our economy continues to rebound and grow, we must ensure that safety and health are a part of that growth. Let's all remember that no job is a good job unless it is also a safe job."""

The Tewksbury, Mass., grocery chain, which has stores in New Hampshire and Massachusetts, faces a total of $589,200 in proposed fines, chiefly for recurring fall and laceration hazards and also for improperly responding to a worker's serious injury. ""Employers with multiple locations have a responsibility to ensure safe and healthful working conditions at all of their workplaces,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for OSHA Dr. David Michaels. ""This employer has been cited for similar conditions at numerous other stores. Although those individual hazards were abated, this employer has not taken effective steps to correct these hazards across the board."" The inspection of the Market Basket store in Rindge on U.S. Route 202 began after an employee sustained broken bones and head trauma on April 17 when he fell 11 feet to a concrete floor from an inadequately guarded storage mezzanine. Instead of calling for emergency help, store management lifted the injured worker from the floor, put him in a wheelchair and pushed him to the store's receiving dock to wait for a relative to take him to the hospital. The Concord store inspection began May 16 after an OSHA supervisor observed the same type of fall hazard as the one at the Rindge store while shopping at the Market Basket store on Fort Eddy Road. OSHA found that employees at both stores were exposed to falls from heights greater than 11 feet while working on top of produce coolers, freezers and storage lofts that lacked adequate guardrails. OSHA previously had cited DeMoulas for the same hazard at the Concord store as well as stores in Fitchburg, Lawrence and Tewksbury, Mass. Employees who worked in the produce, deli and bakery departments at the Rindge and Concord stores also were exposed to laceration hazards from knives due to the grocery chain's failure to conduct a hazard assessment and provide hand protection. DeMoulas previously was cited by OSHA for the same types of hazards at its Tewksbury and Westford, Mass., locations. Due to the company's knowledge of the fall and laceration hazards and its systemic failure to correct them, OSHA cited four willful violations with $261,000 in proposed penalties. A willful violation exists when an employer has demonstrated either an intentional disregard for the requirements of the law or plain indifference to employee safety and health. Additionally, DeMoulas Supermarkets has been cited for seven repeat violations with $225,500 in fines for hazardous conditions similar to those previously cited at its Ashland, Andover, Fitchburg, Salem, Tewksbury and Westford, Mass., locations. These citations encompass amputation hazards stemming from a lack of procedures, training and equipment to ensure that a meat saw and seafood cooler would not be activated while employees were cleaning them, as well as hazards from exposed portions of the saw's blade; inadequate training of powered industrial truck operators; and a lack of bloodborne pathogen training for an employee required to clean equipment and work areas contaminated with human blood. A repeat violation exists when an employer previously has been cited for the same or a similar violation of a standard, regulation, rule or order at any other facility in federal enforcement states within the last five years. Finally, the company has been cited for 19 serious violations with $102,700 in proposed penalties. One violation was cited under OSHA's general duty clause for failing to contact emergency services and for moving the injured employee. The remaining 18 violations involve obstructed exit routes; a lack of eye and hand protection and an emergency eyewash for employees working with or near battery acid; a lack of chemical hazard communication training for workers; and other hazards related to electrical equipment, machine guarding and bloodborne pathogens. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known.

Additionally, the suit seeks restitution of $97,307.79 from B & K Builders Inc. and Staab as fiduciaries to the B&K Builders Inc. Prevailing Wage Plan. The case is the result of an investigation by the department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration into alleged violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. “The Labor Department is committed to ensuring workers keep what they earn,” said Steve Haugen, EBSA’s regional director in Chicago. “We will continue to hold fiduciaries accountable when they ignore their responsibilities and put workers’ hard-earned retirement income at risk.” The lawsuit, filed in U.S. district court in Madison, alleges that the company, Aschenbrenner and Staab failed to forward $17,835.41 in employee contributions to the company’s 401(k) plan from Sept. 23, 2006, to May 15, 2008. They also failed to timely remit employee contributions to the plan from June 30, 2005, to Aug. 24, 2006. The plan had 52 active participants and $222,633 in assets as of March 31, 2009, the latest information available. The suit also alleges that B & K Builders Inc. agreed to utilize a portion of the money received under state and federal contracts to pay employer contributions to the Prevailing Wage Plan. The Prevailing Wage Plan mandates that B & K Builders Inc. pay required prevailing wage contributions to the Prevailing Wage Plan. Staab and B & K Builders Inc., as fiduciaries, failed to remit $97,307.79 in employer contributions for the period of June 2007 through June 2009 to the Prevailing Wage Plan. The suit seeks a court order to restore money owed to both plans; correct transactions prohibited by law; remove B & K Builders, Aschenbrenner and Staab from serving as fiduciaries to the plans; and permanently bar them from serving as fiduciaries to any ERISA-covered plan in the future. It also asks the court to appoint an independent fiduciary to administer the plans. This case is part of EBSA’s national enforcement initiative to safeguard workers’ contributions to 401(k) and health benefit plans. The investigation was conducted by EBSA’s Chicago Regional Office and is being litigated by the Labor Department’s regional solicitor in Chicago. Employers and workers can contact EBSA’s Chicago office at 312-353-0900 or toll-free at 866-444-3272 for help with problems relating to private sector pension and health plans.

Yonts' Mine No. 2 in Letcher County, Ky., operated by Vision Coal, on potential pattern of violations status based on data gathered during agency audits. MSHA found that 19 out of 39 audited mines either failed to report injuries or underreported the lost time associated with reported injuries, and four of the 19 met the criteria for a PPOV. The three operations already on PPOV status include two Alpha Natural Resources Inc. mines in Boone County, W.Va. – Randolph Mine operated by Inman Energy and Justice No. 1 Mine operated by Independence Coal Co. Inc. – as well as the Maple Eagle No. 1 Mine operated by Maple Coal Co., a Walter Energy Inc. mine located in Fayette County, W.Va. ""These results expose an unsettling amount of underreporting at mines that already have troublesome compliance records,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""These audits are an important tool as MSHA scrutinizes its system of operators self-reporting accidents and injuries. We cannot simply accept information provided by a mine operator that may be avoiding PPOV enforcement action."" The 39 audits revealed a total of 76 injuries that were unreported or underreported, including 47 unreported injuries at six separate mines formerly controlled by Massey Energy. A total of 247 citations was issued as a result of the audits, including 98 for failing to accurately report injuries. Two Peabody Energy mines – Willow Lake Portal operated by Big Ridge Inc. in Saline County, Ill., and Air Quality No. 1 Mine operated by Peabody Midwest Mining LLC in Knox County, Ind. – have yet to comply with MSHA's audit. In late May, an administrative law judge with the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission ruled that these mines must turn over documents to MSHA so the agency can complete its audits. After Peabody continued to withhold the records, MSHA notified the company on June 23 that the agency was proposing a daily civil penalty of $4,000 against the Air Quality No. 1 Mine. The proposed daily penalty will continue to accrue until all of the audit information is provided to the agency. The mine operator has appealed the judge's decision to the commission. Pursuant to Part 50 of the Code of Federal Regulations, mine operators are required to file reports pertaining to accidents, occupational injuries and occupational illnesses, as well as employment and coal production data. In turn, MSHA is authorized to inspect any information the agency thinks may be relevant and necessary to determine compliance with reporting requirements, including medical, employment and other company records. Editor's note: Due to a clerical error, Dennis Creg Yonts originally was identified as the controller of Vision Coal Inc. He is the vice president and Kevin R. Yonts is the president."

BHMA LLC,"Date of Action: Oct. 3, 2011 Name(s) of Defendant(s): BHMA LLC Allegations: On or about Jan. 1, 2001, New Hampshire-based BHMA LLC established a 401(k) plan for its employees and served as administrator and sponsor of the plan. An investigation by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Employee Benefits Security Administration found that the company ceased operations at its Leesburg, Va., location in or near 2004 and since that time, had not taken any steps to properly administer the plan and distribute benefits. As of Oct. 14, 2009, the plan had 59 participants with account balances totaling $187,235.51. On Feb. 3, 2011, the Labor Department filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia seeking the appointment of an independent fiduciary for purposes of terminating the plan and distributing its remaining assets. Resolution: On Oct. 3, 2011, United States District Judge Liam O’Grady ordered that BHMA LLC be removed from its fiduciary position and appointed Lefoldt & Co., P.A., as an independent fiduciary to administer the 401(k) plan and in order, to effectuate its termination, including the distribution of plan assets to the participants and beneficiaries.

"October 12, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20111012,US Labor Department sues to restore employee contributions to 401(k) plan of 2 Pittsburgh companies,"PITTSBURGH — The U.S. Department of Labor has filed a lawsuit against Sterling Printing and its president, John Louis Roberts, as well as Mara Scanlon Roberts, chief executive officer of M.R. Graphics LLC, for violating the Employee Retirement Income Security Act by failing to remit worker contributions to a 401(k) plan serving the employees of both Pittsburgh companies. The suit alleges that from April 2004 to July 2006, the defendants failed to remit employee contributions to the plan and commingled them with the general assets of Sterling Printing and M.R. Graphics. Additionally, certain contributions were remitted late and without interest. “This case clearly demonstrates a breach of fiduciary duty,” said Mabel Capolongo, regional director of the Labor Department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration in Philadelphia. “We will hold fiduciaries accountable when they fail to act in the best interest of plan participants.” Filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, the suit seeks to restore to the plan all losses, including interest and opportunity costs, as well as the cost of an independent fiduciary. The suit also seeks to permanently bar the defendants from serving in a fiduciary capacity to any employee benefit plan covered by ERISA. This case is part of EBSA’s national enforcement initiative to safeguard workers’ contributions to 401(k) and health benefit plans. The department’s legal action resulted from an investigation by EBSA’s Philadelphia Regional Office, and the case was filed by the Labor Department’s Philadelphia Regional Solicitor’s Office. For help with problems related to private sector pension and health plans, employers and workers can contact EBSA’s Philadelphia office at 215-861-5300 or toll-free at 866-444-3272.

"October 7, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20111007,Statement by Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis on September employment numbers,"WASHINGTON – Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis issued the following statement on the September 2011 Employment Situation report released today: ""Our nation's labor market posted growth in the month of September. Nonfarm payroll employment added 137,000 private sector jobs, exceeding expectations, and total nonfarm payroll jobs grew by 103,000. Additionally, the reported July and August jobs numbers were revised significantly upward, meaning that we added 99,000 more jobs during those two months than previously was reported. The unemployment rate remained at 9.1 percent. ""I am encouraged by much of the recent data we're seeing, but we know more must be done to speed our recovery. Second quarter gross domestic product growth was revised up, building permits were up, industrial production was up, export growth was up, consumer confidence was up, and personal spending was up. What this shows is that our economy responds positively when Washington curtails the public bickering and pledges to work together to solve the jobs crisis. If we want these trends to continue, our lawmakers must now match their words with votes. ""We've now created 2.6 million jobs over 19 consecutive months of private sector growth. The policies this administration has pursued have added jobs back into the economy, but we need them to work faster and on an even bigger scale. We know what works: cutting payroll taxes for workers and businesses, extending unemployment insurance benefits and making smart investments in the American worker. Now is not the time to abandon these proven pro-growth policies. ""In September, we saw 34,000 local government workers lose their jobs, including 24,000 teachers and other education professionals. The American Jobs Act will stop these losses and give municipalities the support they need to put our educators back in the classroom. Giving our youth a first-class education is critical to our long-term success in the global economy. ""Independent forecasters estimate that the American Jobs Act will create as many as 1.9 million jobs and increase economic growth by as much as two percentage points, if enacted. That's more than 150,000 additional jobs a month. It's crucial that this bill gets an up-or-down vote in both the House and Senate. If leaders in Congress refuse to put the bill to a vote, respected forecasters believe we will see lackluster GDP and job growth in 2012. Inaction is not a responsible option for any lawmaker who is serious about putting this country back to work."""
"October 6, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20111006,"Concrete producer in Gainesville, Ga., cited by US Department of Labor's OSHA for safety and health violations; more than $120,000 in fines proposed","GAINESVILLE, Ga. The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration has cited Candler Concrete Products Inc. for 19 safety and health violations following an inspection of the company's Gainesville plant, which was initiated under OSHA's Site-Specific Targeting Program for industries with high occupational injury and illness rates. Proposed penalties total $120,370. One willful safety violation with a penalty of $48,400 was cited for requiring employees performing maintenance on vehicles and equipment to work within 3 feet of an open and unguarded pit, exposing them to fall hazards. A willful violation is one committed with intentional knowing or voluntary disregard for the law's requirements, or with plain indifference to worker safety and health. Six repeat safety violations with $45,830 in penalties involve failing to remove equipment blocking an exit route, mark signs at fire exit doors, correctly mark a door that could be mistaken for an exit door, provide lockout/tagout training to workers who perform maintenance on machinery and equipment, close an unused opening in an electrical panel, provide outer insulation to an electrical cord attached to a piece of machinery and protect employees from electrical shock hazards. A repeat violation exists when an employer previously has been cited for the same or a similar violation of a standard, regulation, rule or order at any other facility in federal enforcement states within the last five years. The company had been cited for these same violations following a March 2008 inspection. Six serious safety violations with penalties of $19,250 involve failing to keep a clean and orderly work site, illuminate an exit sign, maintain an operable emergency pull cable and provide flashback protection for a gas welding torch. Additionally, employees were exposed to fall hazards at two different platforms because the platforms were open-sided or had improper railings. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known. One other-than-serious safety violation with a $1,000 penalty was issued because the company failed to post an annual summary of its injuries and illnesses for 2010. Two other-than serious safety violations with no monetary penalties were cited because the company allowed flexible cords to be used in lieu of permanent wiring and permitted electrical boxes to have openings that resulted in electrical conductors not being protected from abrasion. An other-than-serious violation is one that has a direct relationship to job safety and health, but probably would not cause death or serious physical harm. One repeat health violation with a $500 penalty was cited for failing to label and identify the contents of a drum containing hazardous chemicals. A similar violation was cited in a 2008 inspection. One serious health violation with a $5,390 penalty was cited for failing to develop and implement a confined space program to protect employees who did welding in the drum of a concrete truck with minimal ventilation. An other-than-serious health violation with no monetary penalty was cited because the diesel tank label beside the scale house was not legible. ""An employer's commitment to workers' safety and health must go beyond policies and involve taking real actions that prevent injuries and illnesses,"" said William Fulcher, director of OSHA's Atlanta-East Area Office. ""Management cannot be complacent about eliminating the workplace hazards that OSHA has found here.""

Solis today issued the following statement calling on Congress to create export-driven jobs by ratifying free trade agreements with Colombia, Panama and South Korea, and to pass a robust Trade Adjustment Assistance program: ""For the sake of our economic recovery, we must open new markets to American-made goods and services. These three agreements are the result of intensive negotiations that put America first. They'll ensure that we're exporting American products, not paychecks, abroad. ""American exports support 10 million jobs, and these pending trade agreements will create even more. The tariff reductions agreed to by South Korea alone will boost U.S. exports by $10 billion to $12 billion annually. ""As we move on these free trade agreements, it's crucial that the House follow the Senate's lead and extend a lifeline to American workers whose livelihoods could be affected by shifts in global production. For half a century, Republicans and Democrats always have come together to support Trade Adjustment Assistance to aid workers impacted by foreign competition. It's time to join hands and pass this critical program once again. ""Congress has a major opportunity here to create jobs and begin to restore the public's faith that Washington can work together to solve our biggest challenges.

The grants will provide education, training and job placement assistance related to high-growth fields in which employers are currently using the H-1B nonimmigrant visa program to hire foreign workers, such as advanced manufacturing, energy, health care and information technology. ""These grants are an important part of the administration's efforts to help ensure that our workers have the chance to succeed in new and emerging fields, and that growing businesses have access to the skilled American workforce they need,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. Secretary Solis announced the grant awards during a press conference at The Catholic University of America in Washington, which received nearly $4.2 million to support training in health care information technology. More than $85 million of the total announced today will be used to provide training to individuals who have been unemployed for longer than six months. In addition, more than $70 million will be used to provide on-the-job training, which allows participants to learn new skills while earning a regular paycheck. All of the grantees are required – as demonstrated on their applications – to partner with at least one area employer that will provide assistance in one of the following areas: defining program goals and activities, identifying necessary skills and competencies, providing resources to support education and training, or helping design the program. These grants are funded through fees paid by employers to bring foreign workers into the United States under the H-1B program. The grants are intended to raise the technical skill levels of American workers and, over time, help businesses reduce their need to use the H-1B program. The original solicitation for grant applications announced funding of $240 million to be awarded through two rounds of funding. Because additional H-1B visa fees have been collected, about $100 million more than anticipated for on-the-job training will be available for the second round. Interested parties are encouraged to visit http://www.grants.gov to check eligibility requirements and apply. The competition will close on Nov. 17.

"October 4, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20111004,"Judge rules Ohio-based Cascom employees misclassified as independent contractors, denied overtime pay in suit brought by US Labor Department","Court yet to determine amount of wages and damages owed; more than $1.6 million sought DAYTON, Ohio  In a lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Labor against Cascom Inc. and president Julia J. Gress alleging wage violations, U.S. District Court Judge Thomas M. Rose has ruled that the Fairfield, Ohio, company violated federal labor laws by misclassifying its employees as independent contractors and, consequently, not compensating them for overtime work, as required under the Fair Labor Standards Act. Cascom, which provided residential cable television, Internet and telephone installation services for Time Warner in the Dayton area, will be subject to further proceedings to determine the amount of overtime back wages owed to approximately 250 installers. The Labor Department filed its suit two years ago seeking to recover back wages in excess of $800,000 with an equal amount in liquidated damages, based on the findings of an investigation conducted by the Columbus District Office of the department's Wage and Hour Division. The hearing on damages has been set for Nov. 22. ""The misclassification of employees as independent contractors is an alarming trend. The practice is a serious threat to both workers, who are entitled to good and safe jobs, and to employers who obey the law and are undercut when others use illegal practices,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""The Department of Labor is committed to remedying employee misclassification and ensuring compliance to protect and enhance the welfare of the nation's workforce."" Secretary Solis signed a memorandum of understanding with the Internal Revenue Service on Sept. 19 that will improve the Labor Department's efforts to end the business practice of misclassifying employees in order to avoid providing employment protections. The memorandum will enable the department to share information with the IRS in order to level the playing field for law-abiding employers. Several of the department's agencies also entered into memorandums of understanding with a number of states to share information and coordinate law enforcement on misclassification. This collaboration will help law-abiding employers compete, prevent losses to states' unemployment insurance and workers' compensation systems, and ensure that employees receive the protections to which they are entitled under federal and state law. These memorandums of understanding arose as part of the department's misclassification initiative, launched under the auspices of Vice President Biden's Middle Class Task Force, to prevent, detect and remedy employee misclassification. Business models that attempt to change, obscure or eliminate the employment relationship are not inherently illegal, unless they are used to evade compliance with federal labor laws – for example, if an employee is misclassified as an independent contractor and subsequently denied rights and benefits to which he or she is entitled under the law. In addition, misclassification can create economic pressure for law-abiding business owners. The Wage and Hour Division enforces the FLSA, which requires covered employees to be paid the federal minimum wage of $7.25 for all hours worked, and time and one-half their regular rates of pay for hours worked over 40 in a week. Employers must also maintain accurate time and payroll records. To learn more about the FLSA's requirements, call the Wage and Hour Division's toll-free hotline at 866-4US-WAGE (487-9243).

Solis releases 3 new reports and announces $32.5 million in grants to combat exploitative child labor,"WASHINGTON — Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis, joined by Sen. Tom Harkin, today released three new reports on child labor and forced labor, and announced $32.5 million in grants to combat child labor around the world. ""These reports provide an overview of international efforts to protect children from hazardous work and identify critical gaps in policy and enforcement that leave them vulnerable,"" said Secretary Solis. ""Through increased education and awareness, and critical assistance to families and governments, we can help make exploitative child labor a thing of the past."" The Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor report, mandated by the Trade and Development Act, contains more than 140 country profiles, focusing on hazardous work performed by children. The report includes major findings on each central government's efforts to address the worst forms of child labor; gaps in legislation, enforcement, policies and programs; and proposed actions for each government to consider in addressing those gaps. It also provides details about the accessibility and cost of education, which is not compulsory everywhere, by country. The updated List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor,mandated by the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, expands the number of goods by two, for a total of 130, and adds one country where they are produced, for a total of 71. Finally, the list of goods and products produced by forced or indentured child labor required by Executive Order 13126 has been updated to include bricks from Afghanistan as well as cassiterite and coltan from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. All three reports were developed by the Labor Department's Bureau of International Labor Affairs based on data collected from U.S. embassies, foreign governments, international and nongovernmental organizations, technical assistance and field research projects, academic research and media reports. The grants were awarded to three organizations. A $15 million Global Action Program grant was awarded to the International Labour Organization in Geneva to provide assistance to targeted countries in order to promote sustainable livelihoods for vulnerable populations; support innovative research and monitoring systems to aid with policy development and program design; and encourage new efforts to protect children from exploitation in domestic work. World Vision in the Philippines was awarded $15 million to address the worst forms of child labor in sugarcane production. The International Labour Organization also received $2.5 million to support the Labor Department's programming and implementation of impact evaluations to identify best practices for addressing child labor. In recognition of the impact of the global economic crisis on vulnerable children, the international community met at The Hague in 2010 to renew its commitment to eliminate the worst forms of child labor by 2016. Delegates agreed to a road map for meeting that deadline and called on world leaders to implement it. More than 215 million children are engaged in child labor, the International Labour Organization estimates, with more than half performing hazardous work. The ILO also has found that a growing number of 15- to 17-year-olds are engaging in work that is hazardous to their health, safety and morals. To address the challenges of combating child labor and to highlight new initiatives, Secretary Solis hosted a panel discussion on Oct. 3. Participants included Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa; Ambassador Jose L. Cuisia Jr. of the Philippines; Constance Thomas, director of the International Labour Organization's International Program on the Elimination of Child Labor; and Daphne Culanag, project director of World Vision in the Philippines.

Singley & Associates Inc. of Media and the trustees of the company’s 401(k) plan, J. Brant Singley and Bradly Weiss, for violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, the suit alleges that from January 2007 to December 2008, the defendants failed to remit employee contributions to the plan or remitted certain contributions late and without interest. The suit seeks to restore to the plan all losses, including interest, lost opportunity costs and the cost of an independent fiduciary. The suit also seeks to permanently bar the defendants from serving in a fiduciary capacity to any employee benefit plan covered by ERISA. “This case demonstrates a clear breach of fiduciary duty on the part of the plan’s trustees,” said Mabel Capolongo, regional director of the Labor Department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration in Philadelphia. “This legal action underscores our commitment to hold fiduciaries accountable when they fail to act in the best interest of plan participants.” This case is part of EBSA’s national enforcement initiative to safeguard workers’ contributions to 401(k) and health benefit plans. The department’s legal action resulted from an investigation by EBSA’s Philadelphia Regional Office, and the case was filed by the Labor Department’s Philadelphia Office of the Solicitor.

They undergo rigorous training to develop skills they hope they will never need to use. Those skills will be put to the test Oct. 3-6 during the 2011 National Mine Rescue, First-Aid, Bench and Preshift Competition at the Greater Columbus Convention Center in Columbus, Ohio. More than 100 teams from at least 13 states – including Alabama, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, New Mexico, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia and Wyoming – will compete in the biennial event sponsored by the U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration. The last time the competition was held in Columbus was in 1951. ""The critical importance of mine rescue teams was underscored with last year's tragedy at Upper Big Branch Mine,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""Having been at the scene of too many mining accidents, I know firsthand the need for well-trained and experienced mine rescue teams. I have the highest respect for these men and women, and am deeply grateful for their sacrifices."" The contest consists of several events. In the field competition, teams must solve a hypothetical mine emergency problem while judges rate them on how well they adhere to mine rescue procedures and how quickly they complete specific tasks. Other events include a bench contest, in which individuals who maintain rescue equipment must thoroughly inspect breathing devices that have been tampered with and correct defects quickly. In the first-aid contest, participants must demonstrate the correct method of caring for an injured miner. In the pre-shift competition, miners examine the mine layout area before their work shift to identify and eliminate existing hazards. Mine rescue training began in the United States in 1910 under the U.S. Bureau of Mines. Joseph A. Holmes, the bureau's first director, sought a training tool that would provide the mining industry with a cadre of mine rescue specialists prepared to respond to disasters. Training efforts evolved into local and regional competitions and, a year later, a national contest held in Pittsburgh, Pa. Among the 15,000 attendees was then-President William H. Taft.

Solis announces $2.2 million through Add Us In initiative to improve employment opportunities for people with disabilities,"WASHINGTON — Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis today announced four two-year cooperative agreements totaling $2,165,998 to consortia led by the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois in Chicago, the National Organization on Disability in New York City, TransCen Inc. in Rockville, Md., and the World Institute on Disability in Oakland, Calif. These awards represent the second round of funding provided through the ""Add Us In"" initiative of the U.S. Department of Labor's Office of Disability Employment Policy. The first round of awards was made in September 2010. ""This administration is committed to expanding job opportunities for all Americans, including those with disabilities,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""The Add Us In initiative addresses employment disparities for people with disabilities by helping employers integrate disability and diversity considerations into their workforce planning."" The goal of the ""Add Us In"" initiative is to identify and develop strategies to increase the capacity of small businesses and communities, including underrepresented and historically excluded communities, to employ youth and young adults with disabilities. To achieve this goal, the consortia will create replicable models and strategies that can be used nationwide by businesses and employers to reach out to people with disabilities in their communities; develop sustainable partnerships between businesses and organizations addressing issues of diversity and disability; and build national and local networks of experts skilled in meeting the needs of business while also serving individuals with disabilities. More than 10 million Americans who are members of ethnic and racial minority groups have long-lasting disabling conditions or impairments. Researchers have found that individuals with disabilities from these groups are often at increased risk for unemployment. Recent data from the department's Bureau of Labor Statistics indicate that, as of August 2011, the percentage of individuals with disabilities that participate in the labor force is 21 percent, compared with 69.9 percent for individuals with no disability. The unemployment rate for individuals with disabilities is 16.1 percent, compared with 8.8 percent for individuals with no disability. Assistant Secretary of Labor for Disability Employment Policy Kathy Martinez noted, ""Small businesses, particularly in minority and underserved communities, offer a real opportunity to improve employment outcomes for one of our country's most underutilized talent pools. People with disabilities, in turn, can improve the competitiveness of our nation's small businesses because of the unique skills and perspectives they bring."" The Office of Disability Employment Policy provides national leadership on disability employment policy by developing and influencing the use of evidence-based disability employment policies and practices, building collaborative partnerships, and delivering authoritative and credible data on employment of people with disabilities.

Defined Benefit Plan in Chicago after owner alleged to have mishandled funds","Date of Action: Sept. 30, 2011 Type of Action: Complaint Name(s) of Defendant : Nicholas C. Caro, individually and as a fiduciary to the N.C. Caro M.D., S.C. Defined Benefit Plan; and, Nicholas C. Caro’s medical practice, N.C. Caro M.D., S.C., as administrator of and fiduciary to the plan. Allegations: Caro, in his capacity as a fiduciary to the plan, liquidated $263,951 from the plan’s investment accounts and transferred the funds to accounts held in his own name, accounts held in the name of a former medical practice, accounts held in his wife’s company’s name, and other accounts as yet unidentified. The transferred funds were used to pay for, among other things, the medical practice’s operating expenses, and were not used to provide benefits to the plan’s participants or beneficiaries. The Secretary alleges that defendants Caro and the medical practice failed to discharge their duties with respect to the plan solely in the interest of its participants and beneficiaries and failed to ensure that plan assets were held in trust. The defendants also caused the plan to engage in transactions that they knew or should have known constituted a transfer to, or use by or for the benefit of, a party in interest. The defendants dealt with assets of the plan in their own interest, and acted on behalf of a party whose interests are adverse to the interests of the plan, its participants, and beneficiaries. The Department of Labor seeks the repayment of all plan losses, including lost interest, caused by the fiduciary breaches committed and also seeks to remove both defendants from their positions as fiduciaries to the plan, and enjoin Caro from serving as a fiduciary to any ERISA plan in the future. The lawsuit also seeks the appointment of an independent fiduciary to distribute assets and terminate the plan, and an order that the defendants pay all fees and expenses incurred by the independent fiduciary.

The Brookwood-Sago grants program was established through a provision in the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006. This funding will be used to develop and implement training and related materials for mine emergency preparedness, as well as for the prevention of accidents in underground mines. ""The ability to keep up with technological advances will not only lead to increased safety, but also gives us a unique opportunity to expand the types of training materials available,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""These materials will allow us to use new and innovative methods to train mine rescue responders and educate the mining community on safety, and that will save lives."" The University of Arizona in Tucson will receive $122,000 to design easy-to-use simulation gaming software for training purposes. This platform, designed to train approximately 50 trainers and 2,500 miners, will have a particular focus on those with low literacy and limited English proficiency. Pennsylvania State University in University Park will receive $216,000 to develop multimedia education and training materials, for both miners and operators, to help identify and prevent unsafe working conditions in and around mines. The purpose of the materials is to demonstrate exemplary strategies and best practices regarding emergency prevention. The Colorado School of Mines in Golden will receive $91,000 to develop realistic computer simulations to train mine managers and staff for mine emergencies, train and evaluate incident commanders and support staff, and train underground search and rescue teams and fresh air base personnel to make decisions based on real-time information and hazard recognition. Wheeling Jesuit University in Wheeling will receive $144,000 to partner with the Academy for Mine Training and Energy Technologies at Southern West Virginia Community and Technical College to create the Active Training Portal for Mine Safety. Together, they will develop, implement and evaluate a 16-hour ""train-the-trainer"" course that applies active learning to underground mine emergency prevention and preparedness. The United Mine Workers of America Career Centers Inc., based in Washington, Pa., will receive $176,000 to develop a real-time simulation program for responding to emergencies that is relevant to new miners, new mine rescue team members and/or experienced miners. The training will be offered to miners, mine operators and mine rescue team members. Marshall University in Huntington, W.Va., will receive $117,000 to develop the Virtual Mine Safety Training Academy – a comprehensive, innovative mine safety training tool with a Web-based, simulated campus environment that includes an underground room-and-pillar coal mine. Bevill State Community College in Jasper, Ala., will receive $81,000 to expand upon a previously successful Brookwood-Sago grant, which developed video training modules for mine emergencies. The college will develop short safety training videos for the mining workforce that will be provided for use in mine safety meetings and/or as a continuous video loop at the entrance of mines. The videos also will be distributed on the Internet for adoption in underground mines across the country, free of charge. The Virginia Department of Mines, Minerals and Energy in Big Stone Gap will receive $50,000 to develop and produce a video showing the proper way to react during a mine emergency. It will be approximately 30 minutes in length and include seven critical sequences of events during a mine emergency. Training grants are awarded for a 12-month performance period, and applicants must be states or nonprofit entities. The grants were named in remembrance of 13 men who died in two explosions at the Jim Walter Resources Inc. No. 5 Mine in Brookwood, Ala., in 2001, and 12 men who died in an explosion at the Sago Mine in Tallsmanville, W.Va., in 2006."

"September 28, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/odep/odep20110928,US Labor Department announces $3.8 million in continued funding to improve employment opportunities for people with disabilities,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Labor's Office of Disability Employment Policy today announced a total of $3,787,000 in continued funding for organizations managing consortia that develop models, provide technical assistance and share best practices to improve employment opportunities for people with disabilities. ""Many employers know that incorporating the talents of all employees and potential employees, including those with disabilities, is a key to success,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""Today's federal grants will help to better connect employers with qualified individuals with disabilities so their skills and unique capabilities will no longer be untapped resources."" The National Technical Assistance, Policy and Research Center for Employers on Employment of People with Disabilities at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y., is receiving $1,520,000. In September 2009, the Labor Department competitively awarded Cornell University a 12-month cooperative agreement for an initial $1.6 million with four option years to manage a consortium charged with conducting research, assisting the department in developing and promoting employer-focused policies, disseminating information, and providing technical assistance to employers and employer organizations. The National Technical Assistance and Research Center to Promote Leadership for Employment and Economic Independence for Adults with Disabilities is being awarded $1,092,500. Housed at Rutgers University's John J. Heldrich Center for Workforce Development in New Brunswick, N.J., the NTARC was established in September 2007 when the Labor Department competitively awarded a 24-month cooperative agreement for $2,350,000 with three option years. The NTARC manages a consortium to develop effective practices and policies to enhance employment for adults with disabilities. The Institute for Educational Leadership in the District of Columbia is receiving $950,000 for the National Collaborative on Workforce and Disability for Youth. In September 2007, the Labor Department competitively awarded a 24-month cooperative agreement for $1,850,000 with three option years to manage a consortium to develop effective practices and policies to enhance employment opportunities for youth with disabilities. The consortium also provides technical assistance to state and local workforce development systems. Additionally, $104,500 is being awarded to the Workplace Inc. in Bridgeport, Conn., and $120,000 to the SkillSource Group Inc. in Vienna, Va. In September 2009, the Labor Department competitively awarded 24-month cooperative agreements to both organizations to lead consortia that would develop innovative models of providing inclusive Registered Apprenticeship training to youth and young adults with disabilities. The Office of Disability Employment Policy provides national leadership on disability employment policy by developing and influencing the use of evidence-based disability employment policies and practices, building collaborative partnerships, and delivering authoritative and credible data on employment of people with disabilities.

The action resolves a lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Labor against the company and its chief executive officer, Kevin T. Weir. The suit resulted from an investigation by the Labor Department's Employee Benefits Security Administration, which found that the defendants failed to remit employee contributions and participant loan repayments to the plan, and also remitted certain contributions and loan repayments to the plan late without interest. These alleged violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act occurred from January 2007 through December 2009. ""Plan fiduciaries have a legal obligation to act in the best interest of plan participants and will be held accountable when they fall short,"" said Mabel Capolongo, director of EBSA's Philadelphia Regional Office, which conducted the investigation. ""Because of this legal action, contributions made by Liberty-Pittsburgh Systems' employees are being protected."" The case was litigated by the department's Regional Office of the Solicitor in Philadelphia. Employers and workers can contact EBSA's Washington District Office at 202-693-8700 or 866-444-3272 for help with problems relating to private sector pension and health plans.

"September 27, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20110927,US Labor Department awards more than $21 million in Disability Employment Initiative funding to 7 states,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor today announced $21,166,560 for seven states under the Disability Employment Initiative to improve education, training, and employment opportunities and outcomes for youth and adults who are unemployed, underemployed and/or receiving Social Security disability benefits. The initiative is jointly funded and administered by the department's Employment and Training Administration and its Office of Disability Employment Policy. ""During these difficult economic times, it is important to ensure that all workers, including those with disabilities – who as a group face employment barriers even during times of prosperity – are able to benefit from the Labor Department's employment and retraining services,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""These federal grants will help to provide services and support to individuals with disabilities in seven additional states, and put them on the path to permanent and secure jobs."" This round of funding is the second under the Disability Employment Initiative, which now supports 16 state projects. The new grants are part of cooperative agreements with California, Hawaii, Ohio, South Dakota, Tennessee, Washington and Wisconsin to implement exemplary employment services for individuals with disabilities in the public workforce system. The states with continuing grants under the initiative are Alaska, Arkansas, Delaware, Illinois, Kansas, Maine, New Jersey, New York and Virginia. All projects under this initiative build upon the department's Disability Program Navigator Initiative by hiring staff with expertise in disability and workforce issues. The grants also support extensive collaboration across multiple workforce and disability service systems in each state, including vocational rehabilitation services, mental health and developmental disability agencies, Medicaid Infrastructure Grant-supported activities, independent living centers, business leadership networks, and other community and nonprofit organizations. ""Our priority is to provide individuals with disabilities the foundation of education, job training, and employment and support services to achieve economic stability,"" said ETA Assistant Secretary Jane Oates. The Disability Employment Initiative also expands the workforce development system's participation in the Social Security Administration's Ticket to Work Program by requiring participating state workforce agencies or local workforce investment boards to become employment networks. Many Supplemental Security Income and Social Security Disability Insurance beneficiaries use the mainstream workforce system to seek employment opportunities. By serving as employment networks, grantees will expand the capacity of the department's One-Stop Career Centers to serve Social Security beneficiaries with disabilities. ""Access to high-quality employment and training services is vital to moving youth and adults with disabilities into the workforce and preparing them for good jobs in high-growth, high-demand industries,"" said ODEP Assistant Secretary Kathy Martinez. The department's priority is to serve individuals with disabilities and those who are receiving Social Security disability benefits, and it is working on early intervention strategies to assist people with disabilities before they become Social Security disability beneficiaries. States will work closely with the Social Security Administration's Work Incentive Planning and Assistance Program and its Community Work Incentive Coordinators to expand services to beneficiaries.

"September 27, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20110927,"US Department of Labor's OSHA cites Sumner, Texas, trailer manufacturers for noise hazards, toxic fumes and other violations; fines total nearly $950,000","SUMNER, Texas The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration has cited PJ Trailers Manufacturing Co. Inc. and Delco Trailers Co. Inc., a similar company owned by PJ Trailers, for seven willful, 26 serious, nine repeat and four other-than-serious violations. OSHA inspectors found workers exposed to unguarded machinery, fall hazards and accumulations of potentially hazardous dust, among other violations. Proposed penalties total $949,800. ""Employers have a responsibility to keep their workers safe and healthy. Willful and repeat citations, as well as significant penalties, reflect the fact that management knew workers were exposed to dangerous conditions yet failed to provide them with basic safety protections. That choice is unacceptable and needlessly placed these workers' health and safety at risk,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for OSHA Dr. David Michaels. PJ Trailers Manufacturing and Delco Trailers are commonly owned, with the same president and management. They share a work site, a human resources division and a safety and health manager, and they have interrelated and integrated operations. PJ Trailers and Delco Trailers previously had been cited by OSHA for many of the same hazards that the agency found during its most recent inspection. Although the company had certified abatement of the prior hazardous conditions, many of the fixes were later abandoned to accommodate production. Since 2008, at least 15 workers have suffered eye injuries requiring medical treatment and or days away from work. OSHA's Dallas Area Office initiated a safety and health inspection at the company's facility at 1807 Farm to Market 2352 in Sumner following receipt of a complaint that employees were not adequately protected from being injured by rotating machinery parts, and employees were exposed to toxic welding fumes while fabricating trailers and noise levels above approved health standards. The willful violations involve failing to provide fall protection for employees working on stacked trailers, provide adequate machine guarding to prevent ""caught-in"" or ""caught-between injuries,"" provide employees with proper eye protection during cutting and welding operations, and establish and maintain an audiometric testing program. Audiometric testing is required when employees are exposed to high noise levels to determine if their hearing is being adversely affected. A willful violation is one committed with intentional, knowing or voluntary disregard for the law's requirements, or with plain indifference to employee safety and health. Repeat violations include failing to ensure that all spray booth areas were kept free from accumulated powder coating, guard several pieces of hazardous machinery, have all necessary lockout/tagout procedures, provide training on existing lockout/tagout procedures to protect employees from hazardous machinery starting up unexpectedly and ensure that medical evaluations were completed to determine employees' ability to use respirators. A repeat violation exists when an employer previously has been cited for the same or a similar violation of a standard, regulation, rule or order at any other facility in federal enforcement states within the last five years. OSHA cited the company in September and October of 2006 and March 2010 for similar violations. Serious violations include failing to provide required fall protection, provide training on electrical hazards and prevent exposure to welding fumes in excess of the average allowed during an 8-hour shift. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known. Other-than-serious violations include failing to enter recordable injuries and illnesses on the OSHA 300 log within seven calendar days and properly certify the OSHA 300A form or its equivalent. An other-than-serious violation is one that has a direct relationship to job safety and health, but probably would not cause death or serious physical harm. The workers' compensation carrier insuring PJ Trailers and Delco Trailers is Farmington Casualty Co. The citations can be viewed at http://www.osha.gov/ooc/citations/PJTrailers314181926.pdf http://www.osha.gov/ooc/citations/PJTrailers314181876.pdf The companies have 15 business days from receipt of the citations to comply, request an informal conference with OSHA's Dallas Area Office or contest the citations and penalties before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. To ask questions, obtain compliance assistance, file a complaint, or report workplace hospitalizations, fatalities or situations posing imminent danger to workers, the public should call OSHA's toll-free hotline at 800-321-OSHA (6742) or the agency's Dallas Area Office at 214-320-2400. Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. OSHA's role is to ensure these conditions for America's working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education and assistance.

"September 27, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20110927,MSHA announces results of August impact inspections,"ARLINGTON, Va. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration today announced that federal inspectors issued 356 citations, orders and safeguards during special impact inspections conducted at 16 coal mines and four metal/nonmetal mines last month. The coal mines were issued 272 citations, 37 orders and two safeguards, while the metal/nonmetal operations were issued 45 citations. Special impact inspections, which began in force in April 2010 following the explosion at the Upper Big Branch Mine, involve mines that merit increased agency attention and enforcement due to their poor compliance history or particular compliance concerns, including high numbers of violations or closure orders; indications of operator tactics, such as advance notification of inspections that prevent inspectors from observing violations; frequent hazard complaints or hotline calls; plan compliance issues; inadequate workplace examinations; a high number of accidents, injuries or illnesses; fatalities; and adverse conditions such as increased methane liberation, faulty roof conditions and inadequate ventilation. As an example from last month's impact inspections, on Aug. 25, Hidden Splendor Resources Inc.'s Horizon Mine in Helper, Utah, was cited for 33 violations, including eight orders, after MSHA inspectors secured the communication system to prevent advance notice of the inspection. Violations included ventilation devices not being maintained, high accumulations of coal dust and hazardous conditions on the underground conveyor belts. The conveyor belt violations, in combination with accumulation of combustible materials, exposed miners to fire hazards. Further, fire fighting equipment was inoperable. The August impact inspection was the fifth conducted at this coal mine, which was notified in March 2009 of a potential pattern of violations. As a second example, an Aug. 19 inspection at Upper Cedar Grove No. 4 in Logan County, W.Va., resulted in a total of seven citations and eight orders, nine of which were designated as significant and substantial. Six unwarrantable failure closure orders and one unwarrantable failure citation involved violations related to ventilation, the mine's emergency response plan, and unsafe conditions and practices that arose from a lack of proper and complete examinations. In addition, the operator failed to notify MSHA of a change from nonproducing to producing status within three working days, as required. ""As we continue to conduct impact inspections at mines with compliance problems or other health or safety issues, there are indications that the industry is getting the message and improving health and safety practices,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""But for mine operators not getting the message, MSHA will use impact inspections and other enforcement tools at our disposal to protect the health and safety of their miners."" Since April 2010, MSHA has conducted 327 impact inspections, which have resulted in 5,843 citations, 555 orders and 21 safeguards.

"September 26, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20110926-0,Obama administration awards nearly $500 million in first round of grants to community colleges for job training and workforce development,"WASHINGTON – Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis and Under Secretary of Education Martha Kanter today announced nearly $500 million in grants to community colleges around the country for targeted training and workforce development to help economically dislocated workers who are changing careers. The grants support partnerships between community colleges and employers to develop programs that provide pathways to good jobs, including building instructional programs that meet specific industry needs. This installment is the first in a $2 billion, four-year investment designed, when in combination with President Obama's American Jobs Act that would provide additional support for hiring and re-employment services, to increase opportunities for the unemployed. ""Making it possible for unemployed Americans to return to work is a top priority of President Obama's. This initiative is about providing access to training that leads to real jobs,"" said Secretary Solis. ""These federal grants will enable community colleges, employers and other partners to prepare job candidates, through innovative programs, for new careers in high-wage, high-skills fields, including advanced manufacturing, transportation, health care and STEM occupations."" Today's announcement represents an initial round of community college and career training funds, which are being awarded to 32 grantees. The U.S. Department of Labor is implementing and administering the program in coordination with the U.S. Department of Education. ""The president knows that building a well-educated workforce is critical to reviving and strengthening the American economy,"" said Secretary of Education Arne Duncan. ""These grants will help community colleges and businesses work together to give students the skills they need to compete for good jobs in growing industries."" Dr. Jill Biden, a community college professor, joined the Labor and Education departments in celebrating the goals of the program, and the hard work of the grant applicants and recipients. ""The grants announced by the departments of Labor and Education today are another clear demonstration of the Obama-Biden administration's commitment to our community colleges and their vital role in fueling the American economy,"" she said. ""Today's announcement is an important deliverable from last year's White House Summit on Community Colleges and one that will provide gateways to opportunities for many Americans."" The initiative complements President Obama's broader agenda for every American to have at least one year of postsecondary education and will help to reach his goal for America to have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world by 2020. Every state will receive at least $2.5 million for community college career training programs through this initiative. States without a winning submission named in this round are being contacted by the program's administrators to develop a qualifying project that will immediately receive $2.5 million. Grants support partnerships between community colleges and employers to develop programs that provide pathways to good jobs. Efforts include building instructional programs that meet specific industry needs, strengthening technology-enabled learning, and allowing students and workers to access free learning materials online. Importantly, every community college grantee has at least one employer partner a sponsor that has jobs available and needs trained workers to fill them. Through these grants, schools will be able to expand their capacity to put more people into high-quality jobs and start new careers in fields ranging from advanced manufacturing and transportation to health care and STEM – science, technology, engineering and math – areas. The program also is designed to have a lasting impact on higher education, emphasizing the use of evidence in program design, collection of student outcome data and conducting evaluations to build knowledge about which strategies are most effective in placing graduates in jobs. These investments, combined with the president's proposals in the American Jobs Act, will help individuals to receive the skills they need to work in high-demand sectors and provide additional pathways back to work for the unemployed. These grants are part of the Trade Adjustment Assistance Community College and Career Training initiative, for which the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act included a total of $2 billion over a four-year period.

Mermaid Meat Co., doing business as Fine Fare Supermarkets at 2901 Mermaid Ave., faces a total of $62,300 in proposed fines. ""One hundred years ago in New York City, 146 workers died in the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire. Many of them died because they were locked in and unable to escape swiftly,"" said Dr. David Michaels, assistant secretary of labor for occupational safety and health. ""A century later, we still find employers locking in their employees or otherwise obstructing emergency exit access. These are imminent danger situations, potential catastrophes in the making. Conditions from 1911 should not continue to exist in 2011."" ""Our inspection found that all five exit doors were locked at night and could not be unlocked without a manager's permission. These workers were essentially caged and that is completely unacceptable,"" said Kay Gee, OSHA's area director based in Manhattan. ""Employees must be able to exit the workplace swiftly in the event of a fire or other emergency. When they cannot do so, they face serious injury or death from burns and smoke inhalation."" OSHA standards require that employees be able to open an exit route door from inside at all times, without keys, tools or special knowledge. A device such as a panic bar that locks only from the outside is permitted on exit doors. OSHA cited the company for one willful violation with a fine of $49,000 for the locked exits. A willful violation is one committed with intentional knowing or voluntary disregard for the law's requirements, or with plain indifference to worker safety and health. Four serious violations with $13,300 in fines involve obstructed exit routes as well as electrical and tripping hazards. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known. ""One means of preventing hazards such as these is for employers to establish an injury and illness prevention program in which they work with their employees to identify and eliminate hazardous conditions,"" said Robert Kulick, OSHA's regional administrator in New York. An OSHA fact sheet detailing emergency exit route information is available online at http://www.osha.gov/OshDoc/data_General_Facts/emergency-exit-routes-factsheet.pdf . Mermaid Meat.

"September 22, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20110922-0,US Labor Department postpones revising wage calculations for H-2B program,"Delay avoids administering the H-2B program under potentially conflicting court orders WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labors Employment and Training Administration today announced a 60-day postponement of the effective date for the final rule concerning the wage methodology for the temporary nonagricultural employment H-2B program. The delay will permit the various courts involved in ongoing litigation surrounding the implementation of the rule to determine the appropriate venue for the resolution of all claims and allow the department to avoid the possibility of administering the H-2B program under potentially conflicting court orders. In consideration of these pending challenges, the department determined under Section 705 of the Administrative Procedure Act that the interest of justice would be served by postponing the effective date of the rule from Sept. 30, 2011, until Nov. 30, 2011. A Federal Register notice to that effect will be published next week. The H-2B program allows the entry of foreign workers into the U.S. when qualified U.S. workers are not available and the employment of foreign workers will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of similarly employed U.S. workers. The H-2B program is limited by law to a cap of 66,000 visas per year. The department published a final rule on Jan. 19, 2011, that revised the wage methodology for the H-2B program and set the effective date of the wage rule as Jan. 1, 2012. On June 16, 2011, in response to a challenge, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania invalidated that date and ordered the department to announce a new effective date within 45 days. In response to that court s order, the department issued a notice of proposed rulemaking on June 28, 2011, which proposed that the wage rule take effect 60 days from the date of publication of a final rule. After a period of public comment, the department published a final rule on Aug. 1, 2011, which set the new effective date for the wage rule as Sept. 30, 2011, without altering the substance of the rule."
"September 22, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20110922,New Obama administration initiative to spur job creation and accelerate economic growth in 20 regions across the country,"16 federal agencies come together to support development of high-growth industry clusters in 21 states WASHINGTON – The Obama administration today announced the winners of the $37 million Jobs and Innovation Accelerator Challenge, a multi-agency competition launched in May to support the advancement of 20 high-growth regional industry clusters. Investments from three federal agencies and technical assistance from 13 additional agencies will promote development in areas such as advanced manufacturing, information technology, aerospace and clean technology in rural and urban regions spanning 21 states. Projects are being driven by local communities that identified the economic strengths of their areas, with funding awarded to the best proposals. These public-private partnerships are expected to create more than 4,800 jobs and 300 new businesses, as well as retain another 2,400 jobs and train approximately 4,000 workers for careers in high-growth industries, according to grantee estimates. The awards average $1.8 million per project, with an additional $13 million in matching funds contributed by the winning clusters. ""The winning projects of the challenge are innovative and impressive. The grants announced today demonstrate the administration's commitment to accelerating the development of strong industry clusters that promote robust economic environments and help develop a skilled workforce,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""These are the types of investments the president is calling for as part of his continued commitment to job creation."" Strong regional clusters grow from dynamic public-private partnerships that bring together business leaders, universities, nonprofit organizations, government officials and other strategic partners to help regions capitalize on shared strengths to enhance the local economy, create jobs and compete globally. The U.S. Department of Labor's Employment and Training Administration is investing $19.5 million for technical skills training. The U.S. Department of Commerce's Economic Development Administration is investing $14.5 million in Economic Adjustment Assistance funds. The U.S. Small Business Administration is investing $3 million in technical assistance. ""The Jobs and Innovation Accelerator Challenge brings the public and private sectors together to build on America's regional strengths and create local jobs in key industries of the future,"" said acting Commerce Secretary Rebecca Blank. ""This initiative is a shining example of how the federal government is working collaboratively and leveraging existing resources to enhance local efforts to build public-private partnerships that support economic growth and job creation."" ""SBA has a long history of support for regional clusters, and the Jobs and Innovation Accelerator Challenge is an important next step,"" said SBA Administrator Karen Mills. ""I am pleased that SBA is contributing funding to bring underserved small businesses into regional clusters across the country. By working with other federal agencies, we can link, leverage and align our resources to give small businesses the tools they need to work together, grow and create jobs."" The Jobs and Innovation Accelerator Challenge is just one example of how the Obama administration is collaborating to ensure a smarter use of federal resources to foster regional innovation in support of sustainable economic prosperity. Strong industry clusters – such as the Research Triangle in North Carolina and Silicon Valley in California – promote robust economic ecosystems and the development of a skilled workforce, both of which are critical to long-term regional success. The winning projects of the Jobs and Innovation Accelerator Challenge announced today are: Rockford, Ill.: Rockford Area Aerospace Cluster Southeast Michigan: Southeast Michigan-Advanced Energy Storage Systems Initiative Pittsburgh, Pa.: Southwestern Pennsylvania Revitalization Northeast Ohio: Northeast Ohio Speed-to-Market Accelerator Florida: Space Coast Clean Energy Jobs Accelerator Knoxville and Oak Ridge, Tenn.: Advanced Composites Employment Accelerator Milwaukee, Wis.: Milwaukee Regional Water Accelerator Project Missouri and Kansas: KC Regional Jobs Accelerator Atlanta, Ga: Atlanta Health Information Technology Cluster Arkansas, Missouri and Oklahoma: The ARK: Acceleration, Resources, Knowledge St. Louis, Mo.: St. Louis Bioscience Jobs and Innovation Accelerator Project Oregon and Washington: Portland Regional Clean Tech Advance Initiative San Diego, Calif.: San Diego-Imperial Valley Renewable Energy Generation Training and Demonstration Center Puget Sound, Wash.: Washington Interactive Media Accelerator Hudson Valley, N.Y.: New York Renewable Energy Cluster Finger Lakes, N.Y.: Finger Lakes Food Processing Cluster Initiative Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota: Upper Missouri Tribal Environmental Risk Mitigation South Central Kansas: Center for Innovation and Enterprise Engagement Northeast, Minn.: Minnesota's Mining Cluster Northern Maine: GreenME The Jobs and Innovation Accelerator Challenge is part of the Obama administration's Regional Innovation Cluster Initiative, an interagency, place-based effort coordinated by the White House.

"September 22, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20110922-1,Statement by Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis on Senate passage of Trade Adjustment Assistance for Workers,"WASHINGTON Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis has issued the following statement regarding today s passage by the U.S. Senate of Trade Adjustment Assistance for Workers: In 2009, Democratic and Republican leaders in Congress worked with President Obama to craft a bipartisan agreement that improved the Trade Adjustment Assistance program to help American workers who lost their jobs to foreign competition or outsourcing. Today, both parties worked across the aisle once again to fit the program for the future and pave the way for the approval of trade agreements with Panama, Colombia and South Korea. TAA and these agreements are essential components of the administration s broader efforts to hasten our recovery and get more American job seekers back to work. The TAA agreement passed by the Senate today ensures that workers who lose their jobs as a result of trade and through no fault of their own will have access to resources, benefits and job training. Today s vote means that TAA is a step closer to being available to all workers whose jobs were moved overseas to any country not just those with which the United States had a prior free trade agreement The TAA program passed today also reflects the goals essential to a balanced trade agenda. It will support jobs here at home as we open new markets to American exporters, while recognizing the costs of trade to some on our shores. Just ask Virginia Vaught. When Virginia s job with a semiconductor manufacturer was outsourced to China, she reinvented herself by taking TAA long-distance online training while moving from one state to another. Vaught eventually graduated with a degree from a community college in Washington state and now works for an Idaho archives center. The TAA program provided me with peace of mind and gave me a sense of self worth in a new career, Vaught said. Many Americans don t know what TAA is. They don t hear about it unless they need it or the program is up for renewal. Unfortunately, false rumors have often endangered this program and the workers who rely upon it when their jobs are eliminated or moved overseas. But not today. Without the transitional assistance and training offered by TAA, thousands of blue collar workers and their families risk sliding out of the middle class. TAA provides critical resources they need to develop new skills to succeed in vital growth industries. As the White House and Congress advance a strong, market-opening trade agenda to create more jobs here at home, we have a responsibility to ensure that American workers impacted by foreign competition have the assistance they need to adapt and succeed in the 21st-century economy. Once again, I commend the U.S. Senate for taking action to renew Trade Adjustment Assistance for Workers, paving the way for more progress toward getting our economy growing and all Americans back to work."

"September 20, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ofccp/ofccp20110920,Tyson Fresh Meats to pay $2.25 million to settle sex discrimination cases with US Labor Department,"More than 1,650 qualified female applicants denied jobs at 4 Midwest plants WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs today announced that Tyson Fresh Meats Inc. has entered into two consent decrees to settle allegations of sex discrimination. The Dakota Dunes, S.D. — based company will pay a total of $2.25 million in back wages, interest and benefits to more than 1,650 qualified female job applicants who were rejected for employment at facilities in Joslin, Ill.; West Point, Neb.; and Waterloo and Denison, Iowa. Tyson Fresh Meats is a subsidiary of Springdale, Ark.-based Tyson Foods Inc., a federal contractor and one of the world's largest processors of beef and pork. ""Companies that profit from federal contracts must not discriminate in employment decisions,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""Today's settlement, one of the largest in OFCCP's history, means that women who were unfairly denied job opportunities will be compensated."" During scheduled compliance reviews of the four facilities, OFCCP determined that Tyson Fresh Meats had violated Executive Order 11246, which prohibits federal contractors from discriminating on the basis of sex. Under the terms of the decrees, the $2.25 million settlement will be divided among the rejected female job applicants. Tyson also has agreed to offer jobs to at least 220 of the affected women as positions become available in Joslin, Waterloo and Denison. The West Point plant closed in 2006. Finally, Tyson will undertake extensive self-monitoring and corrective measures to ensure that its employment practices fully comply with the law. These consent decrees resolve the latest lawsuits in a string of cases brought by OFCCP against subsidiaries of Tyson Foods Inc. In 2008, a Labor Department administrative law judge found that TNT Crust in Green Bay, Wis., systematically had discriminated against Latino applicants in its entry-level position hiring. Last year, OFCCP settled a case against Tyson Refrigerated Processed Meats after finding evidence that the company had discriminated against 157 African-American and 375 Caucasian job applicants at the company's bacon processing plant in Vernon, Texas. ""A year after filing suit, the Labor Department has made good on a promise to those job seekers who were denied the opportunity to work simply because they are women,"" said OFCCP Director Patricia A. Shiu. ""We will remain vigilant, particularly with a serial offender like Tyson, to protect the rights of workers who can and should expect basic fairness from a company that profits mightily from doing business with the federal government."" Tyson Foods Inc. has received federal contracts totaling more than $200 million in each of the past three years and recently was awarded another $8 million contract to provide beef and pork products for resale at two commissary stores in Guam. The company is a major supplier for the U.S. Departments of Defense and Agriculture, and is one of the largest employers in Joslin, Waterloo and Denison. In addition to Executive Order 11246, OFCCP's legal authority exists under Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974. As amended, these three laws hold those who do business with the federal government, both contractors and subcontractors, to the fair and reasonable standard that they not discriminate in employment on the basis of sex, race, color, religion, national origin, disability or status as a protected veteran.

In addition, labor commissioners and other agency leaders representing seven states signed memorandums of understanding with the department's Wage and Hour Division and, in some cases, its Employee Benefits Security Administration, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs and Office of the Solicitor. The signatory states are Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Utah and Washington. Secretary Solis also announced agreements for the Wage and Hour Division to enter into memorandums of understanding with the state labor agencies of Hawaii, Illinois and Montana, as well as with New York's attorney general. The memorandums of understanding will enable the U.S. Department of Labor to share information and coordinate law enforcement with the IRS and participating states in order to level the playing field for law-abiding employers and ensure that employees receive the protections to which they are entitled under federal and state law. ""We're here today to sign a series of agreements that together send a coordinated message: We're standing united to end the practice of misclassifying employees,"" said Secretary Solis. ""We are taking important steps toward making sure that the American dream is still available for all employees and responsible employers alike."" ""This agreement takes the partnership between the IRS and Department of Labor to a new level,"" said IRS Commissioner Doug Shulman. ""In this new phase of our relationship, we will work together more efficiently to address worker misclassification issues, and better serve the needs of small businesses and employees."" Business models that attempt to change, obscure or eliminate the employment relationship are not inherently illegal, unless they are used to evade compliance with federal labor laws — for example, if an employee is misclassified as an independent contractor and subsequently denied rights and benefits to which he or she is entitled under the law. In addition, misclassification can create economic pressure for law-abiding business owners. These memorandums of understanding arose as part of the department's Misclassification Initiative, which was launched under the auspices of Vice President Biden's Middle Class Task Force with the goal of preventing, detecting and remedying employee misclassification. The mission of the U.S. Department of Labor is to foster, promote and develop the welfare of the wage earners, job seekers and retirees of the United States; improve working conditions; advance opportunities for profitable employment; and assure work-related benefits and rights."
"September 19, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20110919,US Labor Department's EBSA to re-propose rule on definition of a fiduciary,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor's Employee Benefits Security Administration will re-propose its rule on the definition of a fiduciary. Consistent with the president's January executive order on regulation, the re-proposal is designed to inform judgments, ensure an open exchange of views and protect consumers while avoiding unjustified costs and burdens. When finalized, this important consumer protection initiative will safeguard workers who are saving for retirement as well as the businesses that provide retirement plans to America's working men and women. The decision to re-propose is in part a response to requests from the public, including members of Congress, that the agency allow an opportunity for more input on the rule. ""We have said all along that we will take the time to get this right to ensure that we provide the strongest possible protections to business owners and retirement savers in plans and IRAs,"" said EBSA Assistant Secretary Phyllis C. Borzi. ""Investment advisers shouldn't be able to steer retirees, workers, small businesses and others into investments that benefit the advisers at the expense of their clients. The consumer's retirement security must come first."" Today's decision to re-propose means that this important consumer protection initiative will benefit from additional input, review and consideration. The agency agrees with stakeholders and lawmakers that more public input and greater research will strengthen the rule. This extended input will supplement more than 260 written public comments already received, as well as two days of open hearings and more than three dozen individual meetings with interested parties held by the agency. Consistent with the president's executive order, the extended rulemaking process also will ensure that the public receives a full opportunity to review the agency's updated economic analysis and revisions of the rule. EBSA will continue to coordinate closely with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission to ensure that this effort is harmonized with other ongoing rulemakings. Specifically, the agency anticipates revising provisions of the rule including, but not restricted to, clarifying that fiduciary advice is limited to individualized advice directed to specific parties, responding to concerns about the application of the regulation to routine appraisals and clarifying the limits of the rule's application to arm's length commercial transactions, such as swap transactions. Also anticipated are exemptions addressing concerns about the impact of the new regulation on the current fee practices of brokers and advisers, and clarifying the continued applicability of exemptions that have long been in existence that allow brokers to receive commissions in connection with mutual funds, stocks and insurance products. The agency will carefully craft new or amended exemptions that can best preserve beneficial fee practices, while at the same time protecting plan participants and individual retirement account owners from abusive practices and conflicted advice. The agency is seeking to amend a 1975 regulation, which defines when a person providing investment advice becomes a fiduciary under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, in order to adapt the rule to the current retirement marketplace. The proposal's goal is to ensure that potential conflicts of interest among advisers are not allowed to compromise the quality of investment advice that millions of American workers rely on, so they can retire with the dignity that they have worked hard to achieve. The new proposed rule is expected to be issued in early 2012.

The Susan Harwood Training Grant Program supports in-person, hands-on training and educational programs for workers and employers in industries with high injury and fatality rates; workers who are young, have low literacy or limited English proficiency and/or are otherwise vulnerable; and small business employers. ""No one should ever suffer injury or death for the sake of a paycheck,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""The grants awarded by the federal government today will provide tools for workers and employers in some of the most dangerous industries to identify and eliminate hazards. This education and training will help ensure that every worker returns home safely at the end of his or her shift."" Twenty new organizations have been awarded a total of $3.2 million in Capacity Building Developmental Grants to develop their expertise and capacity to provide occupational health and safety training and education for their constituents. Five organizations have received a combined $400,000 for pilot grants to lay the groundwork for self-sufficient safety and health education programs. OSHA also has awarded approximately $1.3 million total to 10 organizations as Targeted Topic Training Grants and $100,000 to two organizations in the form of Training and Educational Material Development Grants. Both grant types require that recipients address occupational safety and health topics designated by OSHA, and both support the development of quality training materials and programs that address workplace hazards and prevention strategies. Additionally, a total of approximately $5.7 million has been awarded to 32 of last year's Capacity Building Developmental Grant recipients that demonstrated satisfactory performance. ""The programs funded by these grants are unique in providing hands-on training to workers in dangerous jobs. They will have a long-lasting, positive impact on workplace safety and health,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for OSHA Dr. David Michaels. The grants are named in honor of Susan Harwood, a former director of the Office of Risk Assessment in OSHA's health standards directorate, who died in 1996. This grant program is an important component of OSHA's efforts to provide workers in high-risk industries with training about job hazards and their rights. It also provides employers with crucial information about unsafe working conditions, mitigation strategies and their responsibilities under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970.

The company and Landow have been ordered to re-hire the employee and pay approximately $500,000 in back wages, interest and compensatory damages. The findings follow an investigation by OSHA's San Francisco Regional Office, which was initiated after receiving a complaint from the employee. Landow and Bond Laboratories, formerly based in Solana Beach, allegedly terminated the complainant, an officer, for objecting to the manipulation of sales figures that misrepresented the company's value to potential investors. OSHA determined that the complainant repeatedly objected to this practice between March and October 2008, and that the objections contributed to the decision to terminate the complainant. ""This corporate officer tried to do the right thing when asked to break the law,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for OSHA Dr. David Michaels. ""It is essential that America's workers do not have to fear retaliation when reporting wrongdoing. The Labor Department will continue to protect whistleblowers from retaliation by holding corporations, and when appropriate, CEOs, accountable."" The complainant, Bond Laboratories and Landow can appeal the monetary damages to the Labor Department's Office of Administrative Law Judges within 30 days of receiving the findings. Bond Laboratories, now based in Omaha, Neb., manufactures nutritional supplement beverages and related products for public consumption.

Today's action is covered under Section 806 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act's Title VIII, known as the Corporate and Criminal Fraud Accountability Act of 2002. Under these laws enacted by Congress, employers are prohibited from retaliating against employees who raise various protected concerns or provide protected information to the employer or to the government. Employees who believe they have been retaliated against for engaging in protected conduct may file a complaint with the secretary of labor to request an investigation by OSHA's Whistleblower Protection Program.

Puerto Rico qualified for its full share of the funds available under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act by including in its law provisions that assist recent entrants to the workforce, part-time workers and individuals who become unemployed because of compelling family reasons.

OSHA's inspection identified several serious deficiencies in the company's process safety management program, a detailed set of requirements and procedures employers must follow to proactively address hazards associated with processes and equipment that involve large amounts of hazardous chemicals. In this case, the chemical was acetone, used in a PSM-covered process known as direct solvation. On the day of the explosion, a valve on a transfer line inadvertently was left open, resulting in the release of flammable acetone vapors. The vapors exploded after being ignited by an undetermined source. ""The requirements of OSHA's PSM standard are stringent and comprehensive because the stakes are so high,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for OSHA Dr. David Michaels. ""Failure to evaluate, anticipate, address and prevent hazardous conditions associated with a process can result in a catastrophic incident such as an explosion."" ""In this case, Bostik knew from prior third party and internal compliance audits conducted at the plant that aspects of its PSM program were incomplete or inadequate, and misclassified electrical equipment was in use. The company did not take adequate steps to address those conditions,"" said Jeffrey A. Erskine, OSHA's area director for northeastern Massachusetts. ""Luckily, the explosion happened when there were few workers in the plant. Otherwise, this incident could have resulted in a catastrophic loss of life."" Specifically, OSHA found that the process safety information for the solvation process was incomplete. The employer's analysis of hazards related to the process did not address previous incidents with a potential for catastrophic results, such as forklifts that struck process equipment, and did not address human factors such as operator error, communication between shift changes and employee fatigue from excessive overtime. In addition, the company did not ensure that a forklift and electrical equipment, such as a light fixture, switches and a motor, were approved for use in Class 1 hazardous locations where flammable gases or vapors are present. As a result, OSHA has issued Bostik nine willful citations, with $630,000 in proposed fines, for these conditions. A willful violation is one committed with intentional knowing or voluntary disregard for the law's requirements, or with plain indifference to worker safety and health. Bostik Inc. also has been issued 41 serious citations, with $287,000 in fines, for a range of other conditions, including an incomplete and deficient emergency response plan, inadequate training for employees required to fight fires, obstructed exit access and electrical hazards, and additional PSM deficiencies. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known. The workers' compensation carrier insuring Bostik is Illinois National Insurance Co. The Bostik Inc. citations are available at http://www.osha.gov/ooc/citations/Bostik_Inc_315298281.pdf and http://www.osha.gov/ooc/citations/Bostik_Inc_315298307.pdf .

The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration has cited J & S Plumbing Inc. in Elk Grove Village for one willful and two repeat alleged safety violations involving failing to protect workers from cave-ins while performing repairs to a sewer line in Arlington Heights. Proposed penalties total $57,860. ""Cave-ins are a leading cause of worker fatalities during excavations, and failing to take adequate safety measures to prevent them is unacceptable,"" said Diane Turek, OSHA's area director in Des Plaines. ""OSHA has had a trenching and excavation special emphasis program in place since the 1980s, so this industry is aware of the relevant safety regulations."" The willful violation, with a proposed penalty of $36,300, was cited for failing to properly protect workers who were in a trench more than 6 feet deep from cave-ins by not properly sloping the excavation area around the trench and not using an appropriate protective system. A willful violation is one committed with intentional knowing or voluntary disregard for the law's requirements, or with plain indifference to worker safety and health. OSHA standards mandate that all excavations 5 feet or deeper be protected against collapse. Detailed information on trenching and excavation hazards is available on OSHA's website at http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/trenchingexcavation/ . The repeat violations, with proposed penalties of $21,560, involve failing to provide a safe means of egress to employees working inside the trench and to protect them from the hazard presented by excavated material located at the edge of the trench. OSHA regulations require that a stairway, ladder, ramp or other means of egress be provided in case of an emergency. They also require materials to be placed at least 2 feet from the edge of excavations or for retaining devices to be used to prevent materials from falling or rolling into the excavation. A repeat violation exists when an employer previously has been cited for the same or a similar violation of a standard, regulation, rule or order at any other facility in federal enforcement states within the last five years. J & S Plumbing was cited for the same violations in 2007 and 2008 at work sites in Arlington Heights. Prior to OSHA's inspection in May, which was initiated under the agency's National Emphasis Program on Trenching and Excavation, J & S Plumbing had been inspected five times since 2002, resulting in 16 citations for various trenching violations. View the J & S Plumbing citations at: http://www.osha.gov/ooc/citations/JSPlumbing_315509125_83111.pdf The company has 15 business days from receipt of the citations to comply, request an informal conference with OSHA's area director, or contest the citations and penalties before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.

"September 8, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20110908-0,US Department of Labor's OSHA cites Florida manufacturers and distributors of hair products containing formaldehyde for health violations,"Companies failed to protect workers, warn product users of hazards ATLANTA – The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration has cited two Florida manufacturers and two Florida-based distributors of hair products containing formaldehyde for 16 health violations involving alleged failures to protect their employees from possible formaldehyde exposure and to communicate with the products' users, such as salons and stylists, about the hazards of formaldehyde exposure. Proposed penalties for the companies total $49,200. ""Employers are responsible for identifying the risks associated with producing and using these hair products, as well as for taking appropriate measures to ensure that they protect their own employees and other workers who may be using their products, such as stylists, from any potential hazards,"" said Cindy Coe, OSHA's regional administrator in Atlanta. OSHA's inspections were initiated based on a referral by Oregon's Occupational Safety and Health Division, which tested more than 100 product samples at 50 salons using hair smoothing or straightening products. Some products causing formaldehyde exposure were traced back to the Florida manufacturers and distributors. Formaldehyde can irritate the eyes and nose, and cause coughing and wheezing. It is a sensitizer, which means that it can cause allergic reactions of the lungs, skin and eyes, such as asthma, rashes and itching. It also has been linked to cancer. Both M&M International Inc. in Delray Beach, a distributor of the straightening hair product ""Marcia Teixeira,"" and Copomon Enterprises in Boca Raton, a distributor of the keratin-based hair product ""Keratin Complex Smoothing Therapy,"" have been cited for three serious violations and fined $12,600 each for failing to ensure that material safety data sheets reflected the content of formaldehyde in the products or the hazards associated with formaldehyde exposure, as well as for failing to develop a written hazard communication program for their own employees. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known. Pro Skin Solutions Inc. in Orlando, a manufacturer of keratin-based products used for hair straightening, has been cited for five serious violations with penalties of $15,000. Violations include failing to establish a written respiratory protection plan, provide an emergency eyewash station, develop appropriate procedures to protect employees in the event of an emergency and develop or implement a written hazard communication program. The company also failed to address formaldehyde exposure and inhalation hazards, including possible cancer-causing effects, on material safety data sheets for the formaldehyde-containing products. Additionally, Pro Skin Solutions has been cited for two other-than-serious violations with no monetary penalties for failing to maintain air sampling records and provide written procedures for evaluating chemical hazards. An other-than-serious violation is one that has a direct relationship to job safety and health, but probably would not cause death or serious physical harm. Keratronics Inc. in Coral Springs, a manufacturer of keratin-based products used for hair straightening, has been cited for three serious violations with penalties of $9,000 for failing to provide an eyewash station for employees using corrosive products, evaluate the hazards of keratin-based products for development of the material safety data sheets, and develop or maintain a written hazard communication program on handling chemicals such as timonacic acid, formalin, acetic acid and hydrolyzed keratin. All manufacturers, importers and distributers are required by OSHA standards to identify formaldehyde on any product that contains more than 0.1 percent formaldehyde, either as a gas or in a solution that can release formaldehyde at concentrations greater than 0.1 part per million. The material safety data sheet that comes with the product also must include this information, as well as explain why the chemical is hazardous, what harm it can cause, what protective measures should be taken and what to do in an emergency. The sheets are used by employers to determine products' potential health hazards and methods to prevent worker exposure. Federal OSHA issued a hazard alert earlier this year to hair salon owners and employees about potential formaldehyde exposure resulting from working with some hair smoothing and straightening products. It can be viewed at http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/formaldehyde/hazard_alert.html . In addition, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently issued a warning letter to GIB LLC in North Hollywood, Calif., doing business as Brazilian Blowout, concerning misbranding relating to formaldehyde. That letter is available at http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/EnforcementActions/WarningLetters/ucm270809.htm . Keratronics, M&M International and Copomon Enterprises were inspected by OSHA's Fort Lauderdale Area Office, 1000 S. Pine Island Road, Suite 100, Fort Lauderdale, Fla. 33324; telephone 954-424-0242. Pro Skin Solutions was inspected by OSHA's Tampa Area Office, located at 5807 Breckenridge Parkway, Suite A, Tampa, Fla. 33610; telephone 813-626-1177.

Vermont qualified for its remaining share of funds available under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act by including in its law provisions that assist part-time workers and people who are upgrading their skills. ""These federal incentives help to strengthen the state unemployment insurance systems as our economy continues to recover. Vermont has made important updates to do just that and is better meeting the needs of today's workers as a result,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""These common-sense improvements are helping America's working families, strengthening our communities and building a stronger 21st century workforce."" The Vermont Department of Labor can use the funds to pay unemployment benefits or, if appropriated by the legislature, for administering its unemployment insurance program or delivering employment services. The Recovery Act made a total of $7 billion available in UI modernization incentive payments to states that include certain eligibility provisions in their UI programs. Each state can qualify for a share of those funds by showing that its law includes those provisions.

"September 2, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20110902,Statement by Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis on August employment numbers,"WASHINGTON – Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis issued the following statement on the August 2011 Employment Situation report released today: ""The private sector added 17,000 jobs in August, but those gains were offset by the loss of 17,000 government jobs. Total non-farm unemployment, therefore, was unchanged last month. The unemployment rate also remained unchanged at 9.1 percent. ""Consumer confidence dropped sharply last month as Congress took the nation to the brink of default. We knew that this legislative gridlock was going to have repercussions, and the hiring slowdown reflected in today's report shows the real-life consequences that political gamesmanship has on business decisions and workers' lives. These numbers are a stark reminder that actions – and inaction – on Capitol Hill have consequences. ""Next Thursday, President Obama will outline a bipartisan plan to create jobs and generate growth that pulls the best ideas from both political parties. If Congress is serious about job creation, the package will pass. ""The time for partisan bickering is over. The American people are fed up. Concerned citizens need to get engaged in this process, contact their leaders in Congress and hold them accountable. ""For example, there are more than a million construction workers actively looking for employment opportunities to put their skills to use. We know from our mayors and metropolitan leaders that there are tremendous infrastructure needs in cities and towns across the country. Infrastructure investments would create jobs immediately and be a catalyst for broader investment and growth that are critical to our recovery. ""As Labor Day approaches, my thoughts are with those who have suffered the most during this tough economy – our unemployed. They get up every morning, spend the entire day filling out applications and sending out resumes, and are usually told no.' Then they wake up the next morning and start all over again. I am inspired and amazed by their resiliency. This country's elected leaders owe it to our unemployed workers to end the partisan point-scoring and unite behind a set of common-sense strategies to put Americans back to work."""

"September 1, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ofccp/ofccp20110901,US Labor Department files complaint against Colorado-based cheese producer for discriminating against minority job applicants at California facility,"Back wages and job offers sought for African-American, Asian and Hispanic applicants; debarment from future government contracts recommended LEMOORE, Calif. — The U.S. Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs today filed a complaint with the department's Office of Administrative Law Judges against federal contractor Leprino Foods Co. for discriminating against qualified African-American, Asian and Hispanic applicants for on-call laborer positions at the company's Lemoore West facility. The administrative complaint seeks back wages and interest for at least 270 class members, as well as job offers for at least 17 of the original applicants. OFCCP also is requesting that Leprino Foods' existing federal contracts be canceled and the company be debarred from entering into any future contracts until the violations are resolved and the company corrects its discriminatory employment practices. ""Leprino Foods' hiring process simply doesn't pass the sniff test,"" said OFCCP Director Patricia A. Shiu. ""When workers are denied employment because of factors that have nothing to do with their ability to perform the job, something is not right. Our message to the company is clear: Correct your discriminatory practices and make restitution to the victims or lose your lucrative federal contracts."" Under Executive Order 11246, federal contractors cannot discriminate in employment practices with regard to race and national origin. Data collected from Leprino Foods showed that the company's use of a job skills assessment called the WorkKeys exam adversely impacted minority applicants. During OFCCP's review, which examined hiring practices for a 22-month period, the agency found that only 49 percent of otherwise qualified minority applicants passed the exam, compared with more than 72 percent of non-minority applicants. OFCCP could not substantiate the employer's claim that the exam measured applied math, workplace observation and information location skills related to the essential functions of on-call laborers. On-call laborers perform a variety of entry-level tasks, including inspecting products, monitoring equipment and maintaining sanitation at the facility. Denver-based Leprino Foods is the nation's largest producer of mozzarella cheese. The company has contracts totaling $5 million with the U.S. Department of Agriculture to provide mozzarella and whey products to the Farm Services Agency. In addition to Executive Order 11246, OFCCP's legal authority exists under Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974. As amended, these three laws hold those who do business with the federal government, both contractors and subcontractors, to the fair and reasonable standard that they not discriminate in employment on the basis of sex, race, color, religion, national origin, disability or status as a protected veteran.

"August 31, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20110831,US Labor Department proposes updates to child labor regulations,"Aims to improve safety of young workers employed in agriculture and related fields WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Labor is proposing revisions to child labor regulations that will strengthen the safety requirements for young workers employed in agriculture and related fields. The agricultural hazardous occupations orders under the Fair Labor Standards Act that bar young workers from certain tasks have not been updated since they were promulgated in 1970. The department is proposing updates based on the enforcement experiences of its Wage and Hour Division, recommendations made by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, and a commitment to bring parity between the rules for young workers employed in agricultural jobs and the more stringent rules that apply to those employed in nonagricultural workplaces. The proposed regulations would not apply to children working on farms owned by their parents. ""Children employed in agriculture are some of the most vulnerable workers in America,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""Ensuring their welfare is a priority of the department, and this proposal is another element of our comprehensive approach."" The proposal would strengthen current child labor regulations prohibiting agricultural work with animals and in pesticide handling, timber operations, manure pits and storage bins. It would prohibit farmworkers under age 16 from participating in the cultivation, harvesting and curing of tobacco. And it would prohibit youth in both agricultural and nonagricultural employment from using electronic, including communication, devices while operating power-driven equipment. The department also is proposing to create a new nonagricultural hazardous occupations order that would prevent children under 18 from being employed in the storing, marketing and transporting of farm product raw materials. Prohibited places of employment would include country grain elevators, grain bins, silos, feed lots, stockyards, livestock exchanges and livestock auctions. Additionally, the proposal would prohibit farmworkers under 16 from operating almost all power-driven equipment. A similar prohibition has existed as part of the nonagricultural child labor provisions for more than 50 years. A limited exemption would permit some student learners to operate certain farm implements and tractors, when equipped with proper rollover protection structures and seat belts, under specified conditions. The Wage and Hour Division employs a combination of enforcement, compliance assistance and collaboration strategies in partnership with states and community-based organizations to protect children working in the United States. When violations of law are found, the division uses all enforcement tools necessary to ensure accountability and deter future violations. The division is responsible for enforcing the FLSA, which establishes federal child labor provisions for both agricultural and nonagricultural employment, and charges the secretary of labor with prohibiting employment of youth in occupations that she finds and declares to be particularly hazardous for them. The FLSA establishes a minimum age of 18 for hazardous work in nonagricultural employment and 16 in agricultural employment. Once agricultural workers reach age 16, they are no longer subject to the FLSA's child labor provisions. The FLSA also provides a complete exemption for youths employed on farms owned by their parents. The public is invited to provide comments on this important proposal, which must be received by Nov. 1. A public hearing on the proposal will be held following the comment period. More information, including a complete list of the proposed revisions, will be available in the Federal Register on Sept. 2. Read this news release en Espaol .

"August 29, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20110829,Statement by Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis on sixth anniversary of Hurricane Katrin,"WASHINGTON – Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis today issued the following statement regarding the sixth anniversary of Hurricane Katrina: ""I will never forget visiting New Orleans' Ninth Ward as a member of Congress in Hurricane Katrina's aftermath and seeing the poor families and terrified children that time forgot. Katrina was a wake-up call to this country about the plight facing our most vulnerable families and the critical role that Washington can and must play to support local communities before, during and after a major disaster. ""Last week, as the specter of Hurricane Irene loomed, the Obama administration was ready, deploying assistance teams to staging bases up and down the East Coast. They were armed with emergency supplies and detailed contingency plans well before the storm arrived. This type of coordinated response is what Americans expect and deserve from their government. We must never again be caught flat-footed. ""Despite what some politicians say, public servants and policymakers in Washington can help save and rebuild lives during times of profound crisis. On the six-year anniversary of Katrina, President Obama has recommitted our government to work more closely than ever before with local officials in New Orleans. The administration's ""Strong Cities, Strong Communities"" is a first-of-its-kind partnership committed to cutting the red tape, putting experts on the ground and putting resources at the city's disposal to make New Orleans whole again. ""The people of New Orleans have an indomitable spirit. I believe that, working together, when New Orleans has its 300th birthday in 2018, we will celebrate the remarkable rebirth of a truly world class American city."""

"August 25, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20110825,"US Labor Department finds Union Pacific Railroad in violation of FRSA for retaliating against Kansas City, Mo., and Tucson, Ariz., employees","Omaha, Neb.-based company ordered to pay more than $615,000 to 3 employees terminated, suspended for reporting safety issues and injuries OMAHA, Neb. – The U.S. Department of Labor has ordered Union Pacific Railroad Co., headquartered in Omaha, to pay a total of $400,000 in punitive damages, $90,315 in compensatory damages, $34,900 in attorney fees and more than $90,000 in back wages to three employees. Separate investigations by the Kansas City, Mo., and San Francisco, Calif., offices of the department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration determined that the company violated the whistleblower protection provisions of the Federal Railroad Safety Act by terminating two employees and suspending one in retaliation for reporting workplace safety concerns and a work-related injury. ""Workers have the right to report work-related injuries and safety concerns without fear of retaliation,"" said Assistant Secretary for OSHA Dr. David Michaels. ""Union Pacific Railroad has created a climate of fear instead of a climate of safety. The company must take immediate steps to change this unacceptable pattern of retaliation."" A Kansas City, Mo.-based Union Pacific Railroad conductor was terminated from employment in September 2010 after making repeated complaints to the company's hotline about safety concerns, such as fall and trip hazards, missing and obstructed roadway signs, and various right-of-way issues, and for noting that a supervisor violated safety procedures during a field test. The railroad also cited the conductor for having a tattoo that it deemed as creating a hostile work environment. The conductor received the tattoo, which commemorates his military service, prior to beginning his employment with the company in 2004. OSHA ordered that the conductor be reinstated to his position and receive punitive damages of $150,000, attorney fees of $11,925, compensatory damages of $10,258.51 and biweekly back wages in the amount of $3,437.10 covering Sept. 15, 2010, through Jan. 1, 2011, as well as biweekly payments of $3,527.02 retroactive to Jan. 1, 2011, and continuing until a bona fide order of reinstatement is made by Union Pacific Railroad. A second Kansas City, Mo.-based conductor was suspended without pay from his job for five days in November 2010 after making several complaints to the company's hotline regarding rough spots on the track. OSHA has ordered that the conductor receive punitive damages of $100,000, attorney fees of $10,725, compensatory damages of $5,056.50 and back wages in the amount of $2,170.79, representing loss of pay from a one-day investigative hearing and the five-day suspension. The third Union Pacific Railroad employee, a locomotive engineer based in Tucson, Ariz., was terminated after reporting a workplace injury in August 2009. OSHA has ordered that the 32-year company employee receive $150,000 in punitive damages, $75,000 in compensatory damages and $12,250 in attorney fees. This action follows two other orders issued by OSHA to Union Pacific Railroad in 2010 and 2011, which found that the company had similarly retaliated against other workers for reporting work-related injuries. The railroad operates in 23 states and employs more than 40,000 workers. OSHA conducted the latest investigations under the whistleblower provisions of the FRSA, as amended by the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007. Railroad carriers are subject to the provisions of the FRSA, which protects employees who report violations of any federal law, rule or regulation relating to railroad safety or security, or who engage in other protected activities. OSHA enforces the whistleblower provisions of the FRSA and 20 other statutes protecting employees who report violations of various airline, commercial motor carrier, consumer product, environmental, financial reform, food safety, health care reform, nuclear, pipeline, public transportation agency, railroad, maritime and securities laws. Under these laws enacted by Congress, employers are prohibited from retaliating against employees who raise various protected concerns or provide protected information to the employer or to the government. Employees who believe that they have been retaliated against for engaging in protected conduct may file a complaint with the secretary of labor to request an investigation by OSHA's Whistleblower Protection Program. Detailed information on employee whistleblower rights, including fact sheets, is available at http://www.whistleblowers.gov . Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees.

"August 25, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20110825,Statement by Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis on fatal occupational injuries in 201,"WASHINGTON – Preliminary results from the Bureau of Labor Statistics' National Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries released today show little change in the number of workplace fatalities in 2010 compared with 2009. Last year, 4,547 workers died from work-related injuries, down from a final count of 4,551 fatal work injuries in 2009. In response, Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis issued the following statement: ""No worker should have to sacrifice his or her life to earn a living. ""An average 12 workers die on the job every day, and that reality continues to drive the work of the Labor Department. When the Occupational Safety and Health Act was passed in 1970, the National Safety Council estimated that 14,000 workers died each year on the job. Now, with a workforce that has doubled in size, the annual number of fatalities has dropped significantly. But it's not enough. We cannot relent from our enforcement of laws that keep our nation's workers safe. One worker killed or injured on the job is one too many. ""As our economy continues to strengthen and the workforce expands, we at the Department of Labor will remain resolute in our mission to ensure that safety is not sacrificed as America's workers provide for themselves and their families. My constant focus is 'good jobs for everyone,' and safety is an essential part of that equation.""

"August 25, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20110825-0,Statement by Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis on Womens Equality Da,"WASHINGTON – Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis today released the following statement to commemorate Women's Equality Day: ""It has been a long journey, but each day brings America closer to the kind of true equality that our heroines like Susan B. Anthony and Alice Paul imagined for us when they led the fight for women's suffrage generations ago. ""Women now represent a record 17 members of the United States Senate, three justices on the Supreme Court, 74 generals in the U.S. armed forces and seven Cabinet-level positions in the most diverse presidential administration in American history. ""One in four state legislators is now a woman, 71 women hold statewide elective office and more than half of the states have elected a woman governor. Women are leaders of Fortune 500 companies, nonprofit organizations and the American labor movement. ""We've ascended to leadership positions across all walks of American life, but perhaps our greatest impact can be felt in the American workforce. Not since the days of Rosie the Riveter have the contributions of women workers been more vital to our national prosperity. During World War II, more than 6 million women joined the workforce, building hundreds of thousands of airplanes, tanks, guns and warships – helping end the Great Depression through a production feat that Time magazine called 'a miracle.' ""Today, we are a country drawing down from two wars and recovering from another great financial crisis, and once again it is women who are leading this country back. Women have more than doubled our numbers in the American workforce and more than tripled our college attainment in the last 40 years. In fact, more working women have college degrees today than men, while women-owned businesses are growing at four times the rate of businesses owned by men. ""That's why the Labor Department is investing in workforce training for women to help America achieve a full economic recovery. And it's why we have placed a special emphasis on helping women advance in growing sectors like the clean energy economy, health care and information technology. ""Our accomplishments are undeniable, but the fight for full equality endures. It has been four decades since the Equal Pay Act was signed into law, but women still only make 81 cents on the dollar compared to men. That's wrong, and it's why the Labor Department continues to champion policies to combat pay discrimination, so we can finally achieve a society that offers equal pay for equal work. It's also why we are vigorously enforcing the Family and Medical Leave Act and promoting flexible workplace initiatives so women can balance the demands of work and home. ""The fact that the daughter of first-generation immigrants can become the U.S. Secretary of Labor is proof that women can accomplish anything in this great nation – and is a testament to President Obama's commitment to helping all Americans achieve their God-given potential."""

"August 22, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20110822,"Restaurant group to pay nearly $145,000 in back wages to 66 Southland workers following US Department of Labor investigation","LOS ANGELES — A Los Angeles-based Japanese restaurant group has agreed to pay back wages of $144,721 to 66 employees following an investigation by the U.S. Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division that disclosed systemic violations of the federal Fair Labor Standards Act's overtime, minimum wage and record-keeping provisions. The violations were found at seven locations of Bishamon Group Restaurants in Monterey Park, Covina, Arcadia, Costa Mesa and downtown Los Angeles. The employer does business using the names Ebisu Japanese Tavern, Tamon, Bishamon, Bento-ya and Daikokuya. Through interviews and a review of payroll records and time sheets, investigators found that dishwashers, prep cooks and cooks worked an average of 45 to 50 hours per week and were paid ""straight time"" wages for all hours, rather than time and one-half their regular rates for all overtime hours as required under the FLSA. Employees were issued payroll checks for their regular work hours and then paid in cash at the straight time rate for their overtime hours. Investigators also found that one worker was not issued a final paycheck. The Wage and Hour Division learned of the restaurants' practices through its participation in the Employment Education and Outreach partnership, known as EMPLEO. Now in its seventh year, EMPLEO is an alliance of organizations and government agencies that assist Spanish-speaking workers and employers with work-related concerns. The EMPLEO toll-free helpline, 877-55-AYUDA (552-9832), is staffed by trained volunteers from the Diocese of San Bernardino's Catholic Charities Center and the Los Angeles Mexican Consulate, who refer callers to EMPLEO partners for assistance. The restaurant group also has agreed to compliance with the FLSA by immediately implementing a proper time-keeping system that incorporates the correct overtime wage rate. ""The results of this investigation demonstrate the Labor Department's commitment to ensuring that all workers receive the pay to which they are legally entitled as well as EMPLEO's impact on the communities it serves,"" said Patricia Davidson, acting administrator for the division's Western Regional Office. ""In this case, one worker's voice helped 65 other low-wage employees receive full pay for the overtime hours they worked."" The FLSA requires that covered employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 for all hours worked, plus time and one-half their regular hourly rates of pay for hours worked beyond 40 per week. Additionally, the law requires employers to maintain accurate time and payroll records, and prohibits retaliation against employees who exercise their rights under the law. For more information about the FLSA, call the Wage and Hour Division's toll-free helpline at 866-4US-WAGE (487-9243) or its Los Angeles District Office at 213-894-6375.

Inc. in Hudson, Wis., to assist them in gaining new employment. ""The majority of workers being displaced from Polaris Industries and Robin Manufacturing have been at the same factory jobs for many years,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis.

"August 18, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20110818,"2 Jacksonville, Fla., restaurants and owners ordered to pay more than $934,000 to 30 workers following US Labor Department investigation","JACKSONVILLE , Fla. — Two La Nopalera restaurants in Jacksonville and their owners have been ordered to pay 30 employees $934,425 in back wages and liquidated damages under the terms of consent judgments. The agreements resolve a U.S. Department of Labor lawsuit based on an investigation by its Wage and Hour Division that alleged violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act's minimum wage, overtime pay and record-keeping provisions. ""All workers deserve to be paid fairly, and the Labor Department will hold accountable employers that take advantage of their employees,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""We want workers to know we will defend their rights under the law to compensation for all hours worked, and we want companies that play by the rules to know we will take action against those that use illegal tactics to gain a competitive advantage."" Investigators found that kitchen employees were improperly classified as exempt from FLSA overtime pay provisions and consequently paid salaries that did not include compensation for hours worked over 40 in a week. Additionally, every week, tipped employees would receive their tips plus a paycheck that together equaled the minimum wage; however, management required the employees to sign and return the paychecks, and would then cash the checks and put the money back into the restaurant. Through this process, while it appeared that the owners were paying wages, the employees actually were allowed to keep only their tips. Finally, the employers did not maintain accurate records of the hours worked by employees. The department's suit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, Jacksonville Division. The following parties agreed to consent judgments resolving the suit: LAJAL Inc., doing business as La Nopalera No. 7 on Beach Boulevard; its owners Javier Valencia, Augustin Hernandez and Maria Hernandez; La Nopalera Mexican Restaurant No. 10 Inc. on Phillips Highway; and its owners Javier Valencia and Luis Cuevas. The judgments hold the restaurants and owners individually and severably liable for future violations of the FLSA and payment of the back wages. The employees will receive $584,425 in back wages and an additional $350,000 in liquidated damages. The restaurants will be allowed to make the payments in installments over 13 months to the Wage and Hour Division, which will distribute the payments to workers. Other La Nopalera restaurants located in Florida and Georgia were not part of the investigation. The Wage and Hour Division has several ongoing enforcement initiatives throughout the nation to address similar noncompliance issues that are common in the restaurant and other industries. The FLSA requires that covered employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage for all hours worked, as well as one and one-half times their regular rates of pay for hours worked over 40 per week. If certain conditions are met, the FLSA permits an employer to take a tip credit toward its minimum wage obligation for tipped employees. The employer must pay tipped employees a cash wage of $2.13 per hour or the state mandated cash wage, whichever is higher; all tips must be retained by the employee except for contributions to a valid tip pooling arrangement; employees must be informed of the tip credit provision; and the amount of tips plus cash wages must equal the federal minimum wage, currently $7.25 per hour. Additionally, the law requires that accurate records of employees' wages, hours and other conditions of employment be maintained. This case was investigated by the Wage and Hour Division's Jacksonville District Office with legal representation supplied by the Labor Department's Atlanta Regional Solicitor's Office. For more information about the FLSA, call the division's Jacksonville office at 904-359-9292 or its toll-free helpline at 866-4US-WAGE (487-9243).

An investigation by the Atlanta Regional Office of the department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration revealed that the funds were commingled with the general assets of the company instead of put toward the future retirement of the company’s workers, as intended. The department also alleges that the defendants owe the retirement plan lost interest and opportunity costs, as $117,274 in employee contributions were delayed in being deposited to the plan between January 2007 and December 2008. Filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, Nashville Division by the department’s Atlanta Regional Solicitor’s Office, the lawsuit indicates that the plan contained $218,328 in assets as of April 2010. The department has asked that the court order the defendants to restore all plan losses, set off individual plan accounts of the defendants against the amount of losses and prohibit the defendants from serving in the future as fiduciaries of any plan subject to ERISA. The suit also seeks the appointment of an independent fiduciary at the defendants’ expense to arrange for termination of the plan and distribution of its assets. “These employees put aside some of their current wages for their future retirement security, and the defendants had no right to subvert this effort and use those funds for other purposes,” said Isabel Colon, EBSA’s acting regional director in Atlanta. SEI Environmental Inc. provided consulting services at its office on Grandview Avenue in Nashville until it ceased operations in 2008.

Inc.; Modern Plumbing Supply Inc.; Modern Air Conditioning Inc., doing business as A/C Plus of Pasadena; and Albert Lloyd Hollub, one of the companies' majority owners. An investigation by the department's Employee Benefits Security Administration led to the suit, which alleged that employee contributions made between Jan. 7, 2005, and Dec. 26, 2008, were not timely segregated and remitted to the plan by the defendants. The investigation also found that the defendants misused plan assets for the benefit of the companies. The defendants agreed to a judgment that orders the following relief: They must restore all plan losses with interest, totaling $28,504; be enjoined from violating ERISA in the future; appoint an independent fiduciary as a successor to administer the plan; be permanently barred from serving as fiduciaries or service providers to any plan governed by ERISA in the future, once their successor is place; and pay a penalty to the government for the ERISA violations that is equal to 20 percent of the amount to be restored to the plan.

"August 11, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20110811,US Department of Labor's OSHA releases mobile app to help protect workers from heat-related illnesses,"SANDY, Utah – As part of continuing educational efforts by the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration about the dangers of extreme heat, Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis today announced the release of a free application for mobile devices that will enable workers and supervisors to monitor the heat index at their work sites in order to prevent heat-related illnesses. ""Summer heat presents a serious issue that affects some of the most vulnerable workers in our country, and education is crucial to keeping them safe,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""Heat-related illnesses are preventable. This new app is just one way the Labor Department is getting that message out."" The app, available in English and Spanish, combines heat index data from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration with the user's location to determine necessary protective measures. Based on the risk level of the heat index, the app provides users with information about precautions they may take, such as drinking fluids, taking rest breaks and adjusting work operations. Users also can review the signs and symptoms of heat stroke, heat exhaustion and other heat-related illnesses, and learn about first aid steps to take in an emergency. Information for supervisors is also available through the app on how to gradually build up the workload for new workers as well as how to train employees on heat illness signs and symptoms. Additionally, users can contact OSHA directly through the app. The app is designed for devices using an Android platform, and versions for BlackBerry and iPhone users will be released shortly. To download it, visit http://go.usa.gov/KFE (link is external) . More than 30 workers died from heat stroke in 2009. Thousands become ill from heat exhaustion and other heat illnesses every year. Some of the highest illness rates occur among construction workers, farmworkers, roofers, landscapers, baggage handlers and other air transportation workers. Effective heat illness prevention requires simple planning. Employers are responsible for protecting workers by providing plenty of water, scheduling rest breaks in the shade or air-conditioned spaces, planning heavy work early in the day, preparing for medical emergencies, training workers about heat and other job hazards, taking steps to help workers – especially those who are new to working outdoors or who have been away from work for a period of time – acclimatize to the heat, and gradually increasing workloads or allowing more frequent breaks during the first week of an outdoor project. Information for employers about using the heat index to calculate and address risks posed to workers also is available through OSHA's new Web-based tool ""Using the Heat Index: Employer Guidance,"" which is accessible at http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/heatillness/heat_index/ . OSHA's other educational and training tools about heat illnesses prevention, available in English and Spanish, can be found at http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/heatillness/ . ""OSHA's prevention message is clear: Water. Rest. Shade. These are three little words that make a big difference for outdoor workers during the hot summer months,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for OSHA Dr. David Michaels. Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. OSHA's role is to ensure these conditions for America's working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education and assistance.For more information, visit http://www.osha.gov .

"August 10, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20110810,US Department of Labor provides grant to assist Ohio communities with recovery efforts following severe spring storms and flooding,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor today announced a $16,233,360 National Emergency Grant that will create 1,144 temporary jobs to assist in cleanup and recovery efforts in the wake of spring storms and flooding that occurred in Ohio. Communities across 15 counties located in the Appalachian region were affected by the storms, which occurred between April 4 and May 15. ""The destruction caused by the floods this spring has placed a terrible strain on thousands of Ohioans, and they need to know their government stands with them as they work to make their communities whole again,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""These emergency funds will help local workers provide for their families as they raze destroyed buildings, repair buildings, and clear streets and streams of debris. After natural disasters like this, it's critical that Washington steps up to help residents rebuild their neighborhoods and families rebuild their lives."" These funds are being awarded to the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services. Of the total award, $3.5 million will be released initially. On July 13, the Federal Emergency Management Agency declared a total of 21 Ohio counties eligible for FEMA's Public Assistance Program. This grant will assist 15 of those counties, including Athens, Belmont, Gallia, Guernsey, Hocking, Jackson, Jefferson, Lawrence, Meigs, Monroe, Morgan, Ross, Scioto, Vinton and Washington. Other counties may be added at a later date if further evaluation warrants their inclusion.

"August 10, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ofccp/ofccp20110810,US Labor Department considers development of data tool to combat pay discrimination,"Public invited to comment during early stage of development WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs is considering the development of a new data tool to collect information on salaries, wages and other benefits paid to employees of federal contractors and subcontractors. The tool would improve OFCCP's ability to gather data that could be analyzed for indicators of discrimination, such as disparities faced by female and minority workers. To provide an opportunity for the public to submit feedback, the department published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking in the Aug. 10 edition of the Federal Register. OFCCP enforces Executive Order 11246, which prohibits companies that do business with the federal government from discriminating in employment practices — including compensation — on the basis of sex, race, color, national origin or religion. Last year, the agency announced plans to create a compensation data tool in the department's fall 2010 regulatory agenda. In addition to providing OFCCP investigators with insight into potential pay discrimination warranting further review, the proposed tool would provide a self-assessment element to help employers evaluate the effects of their compensation practices. ""Today, almost 50 years after the Equal Pay Act became law, the wage gap has narrowed, but not nearly enough,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""The president and I are committed to ending pay discrimination once and for all."" The Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that in 2010 women were paid an average of 77 cents for every dollar paid to men. In addition to the gender gap, research has shown that race- and ethnicity-based pay gaps put workers of color, including men, at a disadvantage. Eliminating compensation-based discrimination is a top priority for OFCCP. ""Pay discrimination continues to plague women and people of color in the workforce,"" said OFCCP Director Patricia A. Shiu, a member of the president's National Equal Pay Enforcement Task Force. ""This proposal is about gathering better data, which will allow us to focus our enforcement resources where they are most needed. We can't truly solve this problem until we can see it, measure it and put dollar figures on it."" The notice poses 15 questions for public response on the types of data that should be requested, the scope of information OFCCP should seek, how the data should be collected, how the data should be used, what the tool should look like, which contractors should be required to submit compensation data and how the tool might create potential burdens for small businesses. The proposal will be open to public response for 60 days, and the deadline for receiving comments is Oct. 11. To read the proposal or submit a comment, visit the federal e-rulemaking portal at http://www.regulations.gov . In addition to Executive Order 11246, OFCCP's legal authority exists under Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974. As amended, these three laws hold those who do business with the federal government, both contractors and subcontractors, to the fair and reasonable standard that they not discriminate in employment on the basis of sex, race, color, religion, national origin, disability or status as a protected veteran.

Solis issued the following statement on the July 2011 Employment Situation report released today: ""Our nation's labor market continued to add jobs in the month of July. The private sector added 154,000 jobs, and total non-farm payrolls rose by 117,000, with a loss of 37,000 government jobs. The unemployment rate ticked down to 9.1 percent. ""This is encouraging news, but it also shows that we need to keep fighting for what we know has worked throughout this recovery. That means extending the payroll tax cuts and continuing to support those who are out of work through no fault of their own by extending federal funding for the unemployment insurance system. ""This month's report shows yet again that private sector job growth faces difficult headwinds, as job losses in state and local governments continue to hold us back. Budget cuts in state and local government have led to the loss of 340,000 jobs in the last 12 months alone. ""Now that Congress has averted a disastrous default and protected programs that millions of American families count on, it's critical that our leaders return their focus to job creation. ""In addition to extending tax cuts for middle class families so they have more money to put back in our economy, Congress should pass a bipartisan infrastructure bill to help re-employ the millions of construction workers who lost their jobs in the housing collapse. And they should expand our trading relationships to boost our exports, while ensuring that Trade Adjustment Assistance is reauthorized to help displaced workers affected by foreign trade. ""These bipartisan ideas to strengthen job growth can and should be enacted immediately. I will work with the White House and Congress to ensure that we are taking the right steps to help put every American who wants a job back to work."""

"August 2, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ofccp/ofccp20110802,"Alcoa Mill Products to pay more than $540,000 to settle discrimination case with US Department of Labor","Agreement includes back pay and job opportunities for 39 minority and women applicants plus training for managers and human resources personnel PHILADELPHIA — Alcoa Mill Products Inc. will pay $484,656.19 in back wages to 37 Hispanics and African-Americans as well as $35,516.88 to two women who all were rejected for job positions at the company's plant in Lancaster, Pa. The settlement resolves a finding by the U.S. Department of Labor that the company discriminated against Hispanic, African-American and female applicants for material handler positions. Alcoa Mill Products is part of Alcoa Inc., the world's leading producer of aluminum. The department's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs conducted a scheduled compliance review of the Lancaster manufacturing facility from 2009 to 2010, and determined that the company had violated Executive Order 11246 by failing to meet its obligations as a federal contractor to ensure that qualified job applicants receive equal consideration for employment without regard to their sex, race, color, religion or national origin. Alcoa holds contracts with the U.S. Army in excess of $50 million. ""No worker should be denied a job because of factors that have absolutely nothing to do with his or her ability to accomplish the work,"" said OFCCP Director Patricia Shiu. ""I am glad we reached a fair settlement with Alcoa Mill Products, one that not only provides financial remedies for the affected victims, but also creates opportunities for good jobs."" Under a conciliation agreement with OFCCP, Alcoa Mill Products has agreed to pay the back wages and extend job offers to nine of the identified class members as positions become available. Additionally, the company agreed to spend at least $20,000 on equal employment opportunity, anti-harassment and sensitivity training for its workforce, including all managers and human resources personnel involved in hiring. Finally, the company agreed to revise its selection process for material handlers. In addition to Executive Order 11246, OFCCP's legal authority exists under Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974. As amended, these three laws hold those who do business with the federal government, both contractors and subcontractors, to the fair and reasonable standard that they not discriminate in employment on the basis of sex, race, color, religion, national origin, disability or status as a protected veteran.

"August 2, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20110802,"US Department of Labor sues former North Carolina fabric mill, company president to restore nearly $145,000 to pension plan","LINCOLNTON , N.C. – The U.S. Department of Labor has sued Lincolnton-based Belding Hausman Inc. and President Curtis Wilford Stowe to restore $144,459 in employee contributions, employee loan repayments and lost earnings to the defunct company’s deferred compensation plan. The lawsuit follows an investigation by the department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration that found the defendants violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western Division of North Carolina, Statesville Division, the suit alleges that the defendants did not forward $59,230 in employee contributions and $72,703 in participant loan repayments to the plan but commingled those funds with the general assets of the company. The defendants’ failure to restore these funds to the plan caused participants to suffer $12,526 in lost earnings through July 2010. EBSA is seeking a court order requiring the defendants to restore to the plan all losses, including interest and lost earnings, and that any funds from individual plan accounts belonging to the defendants be set off against the amount of losses. The suit also seeks to appoint an independent fiduciary to administer the plan at the defendants’ expense, and to permanently bar the defendants from serving as fiduciaries of any plan that is subject to ERISA. “Fiduciaries are obligated to act solely in the interest of plan participants and not to use these plans for the benefit of themselves or their companies. The Labor Department will not tolerate fiduciaries who neglect their responsibilities under ERISA,” said Isabel Colon, acting director of EBSA’s regional office in Atlanta. The case was investigated by EBSA’s Atlanta Regional Office and is being litigated by the department’s Atlanta Regional Solicitor’s Office. Employers and workers can contact EBSA’s Atlanta office at 404-302-3900 or toll-free at 866-444-3272 for help with problems relating to private sector retirement and health plans.

"August 1, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20110801,US Department of Labor's OSHA announces measures to improve Whistleblower Protection Program,"WASHINGTON – In a continuing effort to improve the Whistleblower Protection Program, the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration today announced that it is implementing additional measures to strengthen the program and is releasing an internal report detailing a recent top-to-bottom review of the program. OSHA enforces the whistleblower provisions of 21 statutes protecting employees who report violations of various workplace safety, airline, commercial motor carrier, consumer product, environmental, financial reform, food safety, health care reform, nuclear, pipeline, public transportation agency, railroad, maritime and securities laws. ""The ability of workers to speak out and exercise their legal rights without fear of retaliation is crucial to many of the legal protections and safeguards that all Americans value,"" said OSHA Assistant Secretary Dr. David Michaels. ""The new measures will significantly strengthen OSHA's enforcement of the 21 whistleblower laws that Congress charged OSHA with administering."" The Government Accountability Office audited OSHA's whistleblower program in 2009 and 2010, highlighting challenges related to transparency and accountability, training for investigators and managers, and the internal communications and audit program. OSHA also conducted an internal review that examined national and regional program structures, operational procedures, investigative processes, budget, equipment and personnel issues. ""OSHA is committed to correcting the issues brought to light by the GAO report and our own review,"" said Dr. Michaels. The significant changes to the Whistleblower Protection Program announced by OSHA include: Restructuring OSHA's Whistleblower Protection Program will report directly to the assistant secretary instead of being housed in the Directorate of Enforcement. In addition, changes in field structure are currently being pilot tested. Commencing with its fiscal 2012 budget, OSHA established a separate line item for the whistleblower program to better track and hold accountable its activities and accomplishments. These changes, in addition to the 25 new investigators added, should significantly improve the administration and stature of the program. Training OSHA will hold a national whistleblower training conference in September which will be attended by all whistleblower investigators from both federal and state plans, as well as by Labor Department solicitors who work on whistleblower cases. In addition, OSHA will offer several other investigator training events, and will strive to ensure that all investigators and supervisors who have not received the mandatory training courses will receive them by the end of the calendar year. Program Policy OSHA revised and will soon issue a new edition of the Whistleblower Investigations Manual that updates current procedures and includes information on the new laws enacted since the manual was last updated in 2003. This new manual will provide further guidance on the enforcement program to help ensure consistency and quality of investigations. Internal Systems The data collection system has been modified and the audit program is being strengthened and expanded to ensure that complaints are properly handled on a timely basis. A copy of OSHA's internal review report is available at: http://www.whistleblowers.gov/report_summary_page.html The whistleblower provision laws enacted by Congress prohibit employers from retaliating against employees who raise various protected concerns or provide protected information to the employer or to the government. Employees who believe they have been retaliated against for engaging in protected conduct may file a complaint with the secretary of labor for an investigation by the Whistleblower Protection Program. Detailed information on employee whistleblower rights, including fact sheets, is available online at: http://www.whistleblowers.gov . The 21 whistleblower statutes enforced by OSHA include: Section 11(c) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act; Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act; International Safe Container Act; Surface Transportation Assistance Act; Clean Air Act; Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act; Federal Water Pollution Control Act; Safe Drinking Water Act; Solid Waste Disposal Act; Toxic Substances Control Act; Energy Reorganization Act; Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century; Corporate and Criminal Fraud Accountability Act, Title VIII of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; Pipeline Safety Improvement Act; Federal Railroad Safety Act; National Transit Systems Security Act; Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act; Affordable Care Act; Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010, Section 1057 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010; Seaman's Protection Act, as amended by Section 611 of the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2010; and the Food and Drug Administration's Food Safety Modernization Act. Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. OSHA's role is to ensure these conditions for America's working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education and assistance.

When they leave this world, we mourn our loss and pray that someone else picks up their cause, fills the tremendous gap their passing leaves, and carries on their work. ""Richard Estrada Chavez was one of those angels. He was a designer and builder – not just of the iconic United Farm Workers' logo, or homes for farm workers – but of a movement that has bettered the lives of vulnerable people for nearly half a century. ""Alongside his older brother, Cesar Chavez, and his life partner Dolores Huerta, he played a significant role in building the United Farm Workers and designing effective, community-based strategies that changed perceptions, laws, cultures and lives. For decades, the three of them were a force for positive change, making a difference for those laboring in the fields of Fresno, Calif., or the factories in Detroit, Mich. ""As a child, he worked as a migrant farm laborer during the Great Depression, and later became a union carpenter. He put both experiences to work to help create the farm workers' union. His record of achievement and lists of accomplishments are remarkable. He headed the Martin Luther King Jr. Farm Worker Fund at the UFW, which provided health care for farm workers. He built and led the National Farm Workers Service Center, a first-of-its-kind effort to ensure that farm workers had affordable housing. And he had the vision to use new ways of communicating to farm workers all over the country by helping to create Radio Campesina, a Spanish-language radio network. Still active and advocating in his retirement, he helped create and served on the board of the Dolores Huerta Foundation, named to honor and continue the work of the love of his life. ""As the nation's labor secretary, I see every day the benefits of his work, as well as the continuing need for it. ""He was a quiet hero and his legacy will be his passion for justice. Our nation is fortunate that his legacy will live on through the lives he touched. My thoughts and prayers are of course with my dear friend and mentor, Dolores Huerta, as well as the entire Chavez family. They too are part of the marvelous legacy of this special angel.""

This comprehensive report will be of significant interest to employers and workers alike. It provides a better, fuller picture of employee benefits in workplaces across our nation.

According to a consent judgment filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, the companies also are permanently enjoined from future violations of the FLSA. Kinder Morgan Inc., owner of Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP, is one of the largest pipeline transportation and energy storage companies in North America. With approximately 8,000 employees at 470 facilities in the United States, the defendants provide services to local oil refineries and clients such as ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil and Shell. The Labor Department filed suit against both companies after an investigation led by the Houston District Office of the department's Wage and Hour Division found systemic violations of the FLSA's overtime provisions at 11 Kinder Morgan locations in Arkansas, Colorado, Louisiana, North Dakota and Texas. Bonuses paid to employees were not included as part of the regular rate of pay upon which overtime compensation should have been calculated, as required by the FLSA. Additionally, multiple locations failed to pay employees for pre-shift meetings and improperly rounded the employees' work hours to benefit the company. ""The Labor Department will hold employers accountable when they do not properly pay their workers,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""The FLSA requires that hours be counted and overtime pay calculated accurately and in a transparent process. Today's settlement agreement provides back wages, but will also help ensure that Kinder Morgan complies with the law in the future."" Under the provisions of the FLSA, an employer is not required to provide a bonus; however, if a non-discretionary bonus is paid, then the bonus must be included as part of the employee's regular rate of pay for the purposes of computing overtime. FLSA-covered employees must receive overtime pay for hours worked over 40 in a workweek at a rate not less than time and one-half their regular rates of pay. The regular rate of pay cannot be less than the federal minimum wage of $7.25 for all hours worked. Additionally, employers must maintain accurate time and payroll records. The consent judgment is subject to approval by a district court judge. For more information about federal wage laws administered by the Wage and Hour Division, call the agency's toll-free helpline at 866-4US-WAGE (487-9243), or its Houston District Office at 713-339-5500.

"July 20, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/wb/wb20110720,Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis releases guide for providing women veterans experiencing homelessness with trauma-informed care,"WASHINGTON – Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis today released a new online publication, ""Trauma-Informed Care for Women Veterans Experiencing Homelessness: A Guide for Service Providers."" Available on the website of the U.S. Department of Labor's Women's Bureau at http://www.dol.gov/wb/trauma/ , the guide explains the unique experiences and needs of women veterans, and provides organizational self-assessment tools to aid service providers, such as social workers and community service organizations, that assist this population. The guide is the result of nationwide listening sessions with women veterans and services providers about the challenges of homelessness, helping women veterans find jobs and successfully reintegrate into civilian life, and the development of quality resources for the community-based organizations that serve women veterans. More information on the listening sessions can be found at http://www.dol.gov/wb/programs/listeningsessions.htm . ""As the number of women veterans increases, we need to provide better, more tailored tools to support them as they transition back into civilian life,"" said Secretary Solis. ""This guide acknowledges the experiences and challenges facing women veterans, and will result in better assistance and better outcomes for these deserving women."" The female veteran population is estimated to grow from 1.8 million in 2010 to 2.1 million by 2036, resulting in a greater likelihood that more women veterans will need physical and psychological services. Traditionally, service providers have used the same treatment protocols for traumatized women veterans and their male counterparts. The guide will give service providers a comprehensive and compassionate approach to assessing the unique experiences of women veterans and creating effective, trauma-informed environments. ""The courageous service and sacrifice of our women veterans must be honored,"" said Sara Manzano-D az, director of the Women's Bureau.

The case resulted from an investigation by the department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration into alleged violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. “It is an egregious violation of trust when employees’ voluntary salary contributions are not forwarded to their retirement plans,” said Jim Purcell, EBSA’s acting regional director in Kansas City, Mo. “The Labor Department will fight for workers when fiduciaries fail in their responsibilities to properly administer employee benefits.” Filed in U.S. district court in Minneapolis, the suit alleges that the company and its co-owners violated ERISA by failing to forward employee contributions to the plan from Jan. 1, 2006, through Oct. 9, 2009. Those funds were retained in Mirror Factory Inc.’s general account and used to pay operating expenses. The suit also alleges that the co-owners failed to bond the plan against losses. The Labor Department seeks a court order to restore money owed to the plan, including lost opportunity costs, as well as to terminate the plan and distribute its assets to participants and beneficiaries. Additionally, the department seeks to prevent the company and its co-owners from serving as fiduciaries to any ERISA-covered employee benefit plan in the future. EBSA protects the security of the retirement, health and other workplace-related benefits of America’s workers, retirees and their families. The agency oversees approximately 708,000 private sector retirement plans, 2.8 million health plans and a similar number of other workplace related benefit plans that provide benefits to more than 150 million Americans. Collectively, these plans hold more than $6 trillion in assets. Employers and workers can reach EBSA’s Kansas City Regional Office at 816-285-1800 or toll-free at 866-444-3272 for help with problems related to private sector retirement and health plans.

Filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, Atlanta Division, the judgment issued by Judge Marvin Shoob requires that Barry Pugh and his wife, Cynthia Pugh, restore the funds and that none of the restored funds shall be allocated to the accounts of either of the defendants. The Pughs were owners of the custom woodworking company and fiduciaries of the company’s SIMPLE IRA Plan. The department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration alleged that the defendants violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act by diverting funds intended for the company’s pension plan to its daily operations. “Employees contributed to this pension plan with the intention of having these funds available for their retirement, and the Labor Department is pleased that we were able to restore access to the funds for the benefit of plan participants,” said Isabel Colon, acting regional director of EBSA in Atlanta. The defendants have agreed to allow any participant interest they may have in existing or future assets of the plan to be applied as an offset against the amounts that are due to the plan. The agreement also permanently bars the defendants from serving as fiduciaries for any plan subject to ERISA in the future. Craftsmen Custom Cabinets Inc. was based in Sugar Hill, Ga.

Solis today issued the following statement regarding record temperatures across the country: "" Record heat is hitting the nation, putting outdoor workers at risk of heat-related illnesses, including heat exhaustion and heat stroke. Plan now so that you can take the precautions needed to protect outdoor workers during this heat wave: Have a work site plan to prevent heat-related illnesses and make sure that medical services are available to respond to an emergency should one occur. Provide plenty of water at the job site and remind workers to drink small amounts of water frequently – every 15 minutes. Schedule rest breaks throughout the work shift and provide shaded or air conditioned rest areas near the work site. Let new workers get used to the extreme heat, gradually increasing the work load over a week. When possible, schedule heavy tasks for earlier in the day. ""Tell workers what to look for to spot the signs of heat exhaustion or heat stroke in themselves and their co-workers, and make sure they know what to do in an emergency. OSHA has fact sheets and posters that illustrate the signs of heat-related illnesses, and the steps that you can take to prevent them at your work site. ""Remember: water, rest, shade – the three keys to preventing heat-related illnesses in this extreme heat.""

"July 11, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20110711,"US Department of Labor's OSHA proposes $354,000 in fines against recidivist Massachusetts contractor for cave-in hazards in Cambridge and Framingham","P. Gioioso & Sons Inc. repeatedly cited for unprotected trenches and excavations ANDOVER, Mass. – A Hyde Park contractor with a long history of violating workplace safety standards faces a total of $354,000 in new proposed fines from the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration, chiefly for exposing its employees to cave-in hazards at work sites in Cambridge and Framingham. Since 2000, P. Gioioso & Sons Inc., which is primarily engaged in the construction of underground water and sewer mains, had been cited seven times for repeat violations of OSHA's trenching and excavation safety standards prior to the citations resulting from these most recent inspections. ""Time and again, this employer has chosen to ignore the law and, by doing so, placed its workers' lives at risk,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health Dr. David Michaels. ""Employers who ignore basic, common-sense and legally required safeguards will face substantial fines and consequences."" The Cambridge inspection was opened when an OSHA inspector observed a Gioioso employee working in an unprotected trench on Kimball Street. During the inspection, a section of the trench wall collapsed while the employee was still in the trench. The second inspection, at Grant and C Streets in Framingham, began after a concerned passer-by informed OSHA of workers in an unguarded trench. In both cases, OSHA found that the trenches lacked cave-in protection and a ladder or other safe means for workers to exit the trenches. As a result of these conditions, OSHA has cited P. Gioioso & Sons Inc. for four willful violations, each carrying the maximum allowable penalty of $70,000. A willful violation is one committed with intentional knowing or voluntary disregard for the law's requirements, or with plain indifference to worker safety and health. ""An unguarded excavation is only seconds away from becoming a grave,"" said Marthe Kent, OSHA's New England regional administrator. ""While the worker in the Cambridge trench was fortunate not to have been injured when the trench's sidewall collapsed, worker safety must not and can never be left to fortune. Responsible employers ensure that effective safety measures are in place and in use before their workers enter a trench."" The contractor also has been cited for five serious violations, with $32,000 in fines, for allowing employees to be exposed to being struck by the counterweight of an excavator at the Cambridge work site and a variety of other hazards at the Framingham work site. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known. Finally, P. Gioioso and Sons Inc. has been issued three repeat citations with $42,000 in fines for trenching and electrical hazards at the Framingham work site, including failing to maintain the minimum clearance between an energized power line and excavating equipment. A repeat violation exists when an employer previously has been cited for the same or a similar violation of a standard, regulation, rule or order at any other facility in federal enforcement states within the last five years. In this case, OSHA had cited the employer in 2009 for similar hazards at work sites in Somerville, Tewksbury and Boston. This latest significant enforcement action qualifies P. Gioioso & Sons Inc. for placement in OSHA's Severe Violator Enforcement Program, which mandates targeted follow-up inspections to ensure compliance with the law. Initiated in 2010, the program focuses on recalcitrant employers that endanger workers by committing willful, repeat or failure-to-abate violations. For more information on the program, visit http://www.osha.gov/dep/svep-directive.pdf . OSHA standards require that all excavations five feet or deeper be protected against collapse. Protection can be provided through shoring, sloping the soil at a shallow angle or by use of a protective trench box. Detailed information on excavation hazards and safeguards is available online at http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/trenchingexcavation/ . P. Gioioso & Sons Inc. has 15 business days from receipt of its citations and proposed penalties to comply, meet with OSHA's area director or contest the findings before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. Both inspections were conducted by OSHA's Andover Area Office; telephone 978-837-4460. To report workplace incidents, fatalities or situations posing imminent danger to workers, call the agency's toll-free hotline at 800-321-OSHA (6742). Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. OSHA's role is to ensure these conditions for America's working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education and assistance.

"July 11, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20110711,"Obama administration launches Strong Cities, Strong Communities to support local development","WASHINGTON – The Obama administration today launched from New Orleans, La., Strong Cities, Strong Communities, to be known as SC2, a customized pilot initiative to strengthen capacity and spark economic growth in local communities, while ensuring taxpayer dollars are used wisely and efficiently. To accomplish these objectives, federal agencies will provide experienced staff to work directly with six cities: Chester, Pa.; Cleveland, Ohio; Detroit, Mich.; Fresno, Calif.; Memphis, Tenn.; and New Orleans. Teams will work with local governments, the private sector and other institutions to leverage federal dollars and support the work being done at the local level to encourage economic growth community development. Additionally, communities nationwide will be eligible to compete for comprehensive economic planning assistance through a grant competition designed to spark local innovation. By integrating government investments and partnering with local communities, SC2 will channel the resources of the federal government to help empower cities as they develop and implement their visions for economic growth. ""Over the past two and a half years, the Obama administration received feedback from leaders all across the country who described the kind of partnership that would be most useful to them for economic growth,"" said Domestic Policy Director Melody Barnes. ""The result is Strong Cities, Strong Communities, an innovative new pilot that will help strengthen local communities while also delivering federal resources and assistance more effectively."" Added Senior Advisor to the President Valerie Jarrett, ""This is exactly the kind of federal initiative that President Obama pledged to create – one that respects the wisdom of local leadership, and helps mayors and other local officials utilize federal resources more effectively. President Obama has consistently demonstrated his commitment to a robust partnership with America's cities and counties. Strong Cities, Strong Communities is yet another example of this important partnership."" ""New Orleans, as this nation's most immediate laboratory for innovation and change, is a perfect selection for this important growth initiative,"" said Mayor Mitch Landrieu. ""With the amount of federal investment hitting the streets of our city, it is vital that our local government has access to the type of interagency cooperation, coordination and expertise Strong Cities, Strong Communities will provide. President Obama's commitment to New Orleans has been beneficial to our recovery, and this new investment will help spur the revitalization of our economy, infrastructure and quality of life."" Through this pilot, the Obama administration will focus on three key goals: Improving the way federal government does business: cutting through red tape and rationalizing the federal bureaucracy to help deal with the overlapping maze of agencies, regulations and program requirements that are sometimes confusing to local governments. Providing assistance and support – working with local communities to find ground up, not top down solutions: providing on the ground technical assistance and planning resources tailored to local governments' needs, and helping them use the federal funds they already receive more efficiently and effectively. Partnering for growth: developing critical partnerships with key local and regional stakeholders that encompass not only municipal and state governments, but also new partnerships with the business community, nonprofits, anchor institutions, faith-based institutions, and other public, private and philanthropic leaders. ""President Obama's Strong Cities, Strong Communities initiative is bold and innovative, and will immediately bring new federal resources to the great city of New Orleans,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""It is with enormous pride that I return to New Orleans on behalf of the president to announce this initiative with Mayor Landrieu."" In addition to building the capacity of local governments, SC2 aims to encourage partnerships among local community organizations, anchor institutions, businesses, foundations and government agencies, helping to leverage federal investments and increase impact. The four components of SC2 include: SC2 Community Solutions Teams: These are comprised of federal employees from several different agencies who will work directly with cities to support mayors in Chester, Pa.; Cleveland, Ohio; Detroit, Mich.; Fresno, Calif.; Memphis, Tenn.; and New Orleans, La. Community Solutions Teams will assist cities with issues mayors have identified as vital to their economic strategies, including efforts to build on local assets, strengthen regional economies, develop transportation infrastructure, improve job-training programs and support community revitalization. SC2 Fellowship Program: A complement to the Community Solutions Teams, a new fellowship program will select, train and place early- to mid-career professionals to serve multi-year terms in local government positions to give cities additional capacity. An intermediary will be selected to run the fellowship program, and fellows will be selected through a competitive national process. The program will be funded primarily by philanthropic partners; the Rockefeller Foundation is providing $2.5 million in initial funding. SC2 Economic Planning Challenge: In addition to the six pilot locations, SC2 includes an Economic Planning Challenge designed to help additional cities develop economic blueprints. This national grant competition will enable cities to adopt and implement innovative economic development strategies to support comprehensive city and regional planning efforts. Six cities will be competitively selected to receive grants of approximately $1 million that they will use to administer an ""X-prize style"" competition, whereby they will challenge multi-disciplinary teams of experts to develop comprehensive economic and land use proposals for their cities. The challenge will be administered by the Economic Development Administration, which will assist cities in the administration of the competition. National Resource Network : Pending authorization of funding, the National Resource Network will aggregate public and private resources to provide a broader set of cities, towns and regions with access to a one-stop portal of national experts to provide holistic policy and implementation support. Once funds are secured, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development will host a competition to select an intermediary to run the NRN. Cities, towns and regions will apply for access to the NRN, and outside experts will apply to be able to provide consulting services through the NRN. A menu of customized and comprehensive technical assistance in a variety of policy areas will be available to communities, delivered through on-site training and staff development. The NRN will also foster peer-to-peer learning to strengthen the network of urban practitioners and thinkers. SC2 pilot cities were selected on the basis of economic need, strong local leadership and collaboration, potential for economic growth, geographic diversity and the ability to test the SC2 model across a range of environments. Federal assessment teams spent time on the ground working directly with mayors and other local officials to determine needs and opportunities, and gather input for the pilot initiative."
"July 8, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20110708,Statement of Labor Secretary Hilda L. Solis on June employment numbers,"WASHINGTON – Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis issued the following statement on the June 2011 Employment Situation report released today: ""Our nation's labor market experienced slower growth in the month of June. The private sector added 57,000 jobs, but federal, state and local governments cut a combined 39,000 positions, resulting in a total gain of 18,000 non-farm payroll jobs last month. The national unemployment rate edged up to 9.2 percent. ""We've now had 16 straight months of private sector job growth and added more than 2.2 million private sector jobs in this span. Our economic recovery is being, and needs to be, carried by the private sector. But we need to see businesses do more to employ American workers. Many companies have had a great year and are sitting on large piles of capital. It is critical that they begin to turn their profits into jobs for the American people. ""We need to go back to what was working. President Obama forcefully has advocated for common-sense investments in areas like infrastructure, transportation and manufacturing that will bolster our recovery and allow us to pursue long-term solutions to put Americans back to work. We must make investments in our roads, bridges, and most especially, in the education and training of our people. ""Congress needs to show leadership and send a signal to the markets that Republicans and Democrats are capable of putting aside their differences to act on behalf of the American worker. Lawmakers must quickly come together to approve a plan to raise the debt ceiling to avoid a crisis of confidence about whether we will default on our obligations. We need to remove investors' uncertainty about what the future holds. ""One step Congress could take immediately to keep workers on the job is to reform the unemployment insurance system so more states will participate in work-sharing programs. These programs allow employers to avoid making layoffs during lean times by instead reducing some workers' hours, while states make up a portion of their lost wages through their unemployment funds. ""Work-sharing is a proven job-saver, but fewer than half of all states utilize it. These programs saved more than 265,000 jobs in the previous two years alone. Work-sharing helps businesses retain skilled workers in whom they've invested time and money; it keeps workers on the payroll so they can keep their skills fresh and provide for their families; and it saves taxpayers money by reducing the number of people seeking full unemployment compensation."""

"July 7, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20110707,Statement by Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis on unemployment insurance reform legislation,"WASHINGTON – Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis today issued the following statement regarding the introduction of federal legislation to reform the unemployment insurance system: ""I am pleased that Sen. Jack Reed and Rep. Rosa DeLauro have introduced legislation to reform the UI system to benefit both workers and employers across the U.S. The legislation put forward promotes short-time compensation, also known as 'work-sharing.' ""Work-sharing is a true win-win for workers and businesses, and an important tool for helping support our economy during tough times. It enhances our social safety net by providing prorated unemployment insurance benefits to individuals whose work hours are reduced in lieu of layoffs. STC keeps workers on the job, keeps their skills sharp and allows businesses to maintain their investment in workers. Additionally, STC helps businesses avoid the cost of recruiting and retraining workers, and keeps them well-positioned to scale up production when business picks up again. ""STC has received strong bipartisan support in a number of states, including Pennsylvania, which recently passed its own STC law. President Obama and I strongly support STC, especially in tough economic times. That's why the president's 2012 budget included a proposal designed to provide employers with immediate access to a temporary federal STC program, and encourage states to adopt and expand use of STC programs. ""The president's budget recommended, and the bills introduced include, a two-year federal STC program. This federal initiative would provide employers in states without their own STC programs immediate access to the benefits it provides. States that have approved shared-work programs could receive up to three years of federal funding. The budget proposal also would provide states with the resources they need to jump-start STC programs, and deliver their benefits effectively to businesses and their workers. ""We are at a critical time, and millions of Americans remain unemployed. I appreciate Sen. Reed's longtime commitment to promoting STC as a common-sense approach to keep people working and businesses running. For workers, their families and the broader pace of our economic recovery, Congress should give these proposals worthy consideration."""
"July 7, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20110707,Prince Georges County Public Schools agrees to pay $4.2 million in back wages for violations of H-1B temporary foreign worker program,"WASHINGTON  The U.S. Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division has obtained an agreement for Maryland's Prince George's County Public Schools system to pay $4,222,146 in back wages due 1,044 workers to resolve violations of the H-1B temporary foreign worker program. Investigators from the department found that PGCPS illegally reduced the wages of the H-1B workers by requiring them to pay fees that the school system was required to pay. The H-1B program allows employers to hire foreign professionals in certain specialty occupations to work temporarily in the U.S. Workers hired under the H-1B program must be paid at least the same wage rates and benefits as those paid to U.S. workers doing the same job in the same area, so that the wages of similarly employed U.S. workers are not adversely affected. ""The Labor Department has the responsibility for ensuring that employers who use the H-1B program follow the law and do not place U.S. workers at a disadvantage to H-1B workers,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""We are pleased this investigation has been resolved with workers paid all the back wages to which they are entitled."" Due to the willful nature of some of the violations, PGCPS also has agreed to pay $100,000 in civil money penalties and to be debarred for two years from filing new petitions, requests for extensions or requests for permanent residency for foreign workers under any employment-based visa program. Under the statute governing the H-1B program, willful wage violations are subject to a debarment period of at least two years. Violations are willful when an employer knew or acted in reckless disregard for whether its actions were impermissible. The H-1B visa program requires that employers pay certain fees, including an anti-fraud fee and a filing fee, when they utilize the program. Instead of paying these fees and other costs associated with recruiting H-1B workers and filing their visa petitions, PGCPS required the foreign workers to pay them. As a result, the workers' earnings were reduced below the amount legally required to be paid. The Wage and Hour Division's investigation covered fees associated with the H-1B application process from May 2005 to January 2011. The agreement is subject to approval by an administrative law judge. For more information about the requirements of the H-1B visa program, review the Wage and Hour Division's H-1B Web page at http://www.dol.gov/whd/immigration/h1b.htm .

"July 6, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20110706,Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis announces new director for administrations Office of Recovery for Auto Communities and Workers,"WASHINGTON – Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis today announced that Jay Williams will serve as the new director of recovery for auto communities and workers. Beginning on Aug. 8, Williams will lead the Office of Recovery for Auto Communities and Workers as it assists auto communities in identifying federal resources that may be used as part of their recovery efforts. Where resources are lacking, the office will recommend changes or new methods that can be used toward the revitalization of these communities. ""When others wanted to abandon the auto industry and its workers, President Obama stood up for them. Through his strong leadership, the industry is recovering. The many small businesses that rely upon, and are impacted by, the health of the industry have survived, and in many cases thrived,"" said Secretary Solis. ""We know there is more work to be done, and that is why I am so pleased to have Jay Williams joining the team. His proven leadership skills will be invaluable to advancing the work of the office."" Williams has served as the mayor of Youngstown, Ohio, since 2006. During his tenure, he helped revitalize neighborhoods and increase investments in broad-based economic development initiatives. He is a vocal proponent of regional economic planning to help communities succeed in the changing global economic environment. Federal efforts to provide strategic and timely assistance to auto communities and workers throughout the country include the following: The Department of Labor has issued National Emergency Grants totaling more than $70 million since January 2009 to Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin, California, Delaware, Minnesota and Missouri to help displaced auto workers. The Environmental Protection Agency has awarded $111.9 million in Brownfields program grants, with Michigan as its greatest recipient. The Department of Energy has awarded $2.4 billion through its Electric Drive Vehicle Battery and Component Manufacturing Initiative to fund next generation electric vehicles and battery development. The DOE's Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing Loans program has guaranteed more than $8.4 billion in loans to Michigan, California, Delaware, Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, Missouri and Ohio-based auto companies. The Treasury Department has issued $25 billion in Recovery Zone Bonds, a program made possible by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which targets communities – such as auto communities – that have experienced rapid increases in unemployment.

""Failing to properly compensate employees for pre- or post-shift work is a violation of federal law,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""The Labor Department is committed to ensuring that employers abide by the law so that workers are protected against exploitation, and law-abiding employers are not placed at a competitive disadvantage."" Through interviews with employees and a review of the company's timekeeping and payroll systems, investigators found that the company did not account for time employees spent performing pre-shift work activities. Employees routinely performed an average of 30 minutes of unrecorded and uncompensated work — such as turning on work stations, logging into the company phone system and initiating certain software applications necessary to begin their call center duties — per week. Because employees' pre-shift work times were excluded from official time and payroll records, they were not paid for all hours and are owed compensation at time and one-half their regular rates for hours that exceeded 40 per week. Farmers Insurance has agreed to pay back wages, as well as to maintain future compliance with the FLSA by properly recording and compensating all hours worked by its employees. The agreement affects call center employees who worked between Jan. 1, 2009, and May 10, 2010, at Farmers' HelpPoint facilities in Olathe, Kan.; Oklahoma City, Okla.; Lake Mary, Fla.; and Grand Rapids, Mich. It also affects workers employed at a former location in Overland Park, Kan., between Jan. 1, 2009, and Jan. 10, 2010. Additionally, it affects employees who worked between Jan. 1, 2009, and Feb. 1, 2010, at Farmers' ServicePoint and commercial facilities in Austin, Texas; a ServicePoint facility in Grand Rapids, Mich.; a ServicePoint facility in Olathe, Kan.; and ServicePoint and commercial facilities in Hillsboro, Ore. The FLSA requires that covered employees be paid for pre-shift and post-shift job duties, and for attending required meetings. Employees must be paid time and one-half their regular rates, including commissions, bonuses and incentive pay, for hours worked beyond 40 per week. Employers must pay at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 for all hours worked, and maintain accurate time and payroll records. For more information about the FLSA, call the Wage and Hour Division's toll-free helpline at 866-4US-WAGE (487-9243) or its Los Angeles office at 213-894-6375.

The consent judgment and order resolve a lawsuit filed by the Labor Department in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California against the company and its officers and co-owners, Christopher Barringer and Atilano Alcala. The suit followed an investigation by the Labor Department's Employee Benefits Security Administration, which found that the defendants failed to forward 401(k) plan contributions deducted from employees' paychecks between September 2007 and November 2009. Additionally, the company failed to collect mandatory employer prevailing wage contributions and fringe benefits owed to the plan for periods when workers were employed through government contracts. The plan had as many as 96 participants who will be eligible to receive distributions as a result of this action. ""These workers and their families are counting on hard-earned retirement benefits,"" said Jean Ackerman, EBSA's regional director in San Francisco. ""The Labor Department is committed to holding fiduciaries legally accountable when they fail to act in the best interest of plan participants and beneficiaries."" The department previously obtained a stipulated judgment against Barringer in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceeding filed in the U.S Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of California. That judgment, which declared that Barringer's debt to the plan was not dischargeable, cleared the path for the department to pursue its action in district court. This case is part of EBSA's national enforcement initiative to safeguard workers' contributions to 401(k) and health benefit plans. EBSA's San Francisco Regional Office conducted the investigation. Employers and workers can contact that office at 415-625-2481 or toll-free at 866-444-3272 for help with problems relating to private sector retirement and health plans.

Solis on importance of Trade Adjustment Assistance,"WASHINGTON – Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis today issued the following statement regarding the importance of Trade Adjustment Assistance: With many Americans looking for a job, promising new trade agreements that would create tens of thousands of jobs are being held up by partisan politics. These agreements must include responsible, cost-effective Trade Adjustment Assistance to help American workers who may be negatively affected by trade. This week, we finally reached a bipartisan agreement on TAA. But as we moved closer to the finish line, the Senate Republicans were missing in action. Every day we wait, more workers and their families go without the vital support and benefits TAA provides. We need to move with greater urgency and speed to give American workers the support they deserve."

"June 29, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20110629-0,US Labor Department announces nearly $84 million for career training and housing assistance to migrant and seasonal farmworkers,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor today announced $83,941,360 in grants through the National Farmworker Jobs Program to combat the chronic unemployment and underemployment experienced by migrant and seasonal farmworkers who depend primarily on agricultural labor jobs. A total of $78,253,180 will go to 52 organizations nationwide to provide training, employment and support services for farmworkers and their families. An additional $5,688,600 will go to 16 organizations to provide temporary or permanent housing assistance. The National Farmworker Jobs Program helps eligible workers improve their agricultural job skills, and train for careers in emerging industries and occupations that offer higher wages and more stable employment. The program also offers services such as child care, health care and transportation assistance. ""Agricultural workers face significant barriers to stable employment, and all too often it is their families who pay the price,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""These grants address this reality by not only helping workers improve and expand their job skills, but also by providing housing and other crucial support services."" The housing assistance grants will provide permanent housing assistance, temporary and/or emergency housing assistance, or a combination of both. Permanent housing assistance services include pre-development and development services; project management; and resource development to secure acquisition, construction or renovation, and other operating funds for farmworker housing. Temporary housing assistance services include housing units for temporary occupancy, the management of such housing units, emergency housing payments and case management. Services typically are provided in more than one state or areas of a single state. The National Farmworker Jobs Program is authorized by Congress in Section 167 of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, and grants are allocated through a formula that estimates the number of eligible workers in each state or territory. Puerto Rico and 45 states each have one grantee. California has five grantees. There are no grantees in Alaska. Connecticut and Rhode Island are considered a combined service delivery area, as are Maryland and Delaware. The grants cover a two-year period but are funded on an annual basis. The awards announced today are for July 1, 2011, through June 30, 2012. Second year allocations will be dependent on the funds available through the fiscal year 2012 appropriations process and on grantees' compliance with all current and future departmental guidance.

"June 29, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20110629,US Labor Department announces release of $97.7 million in unemployment insurance modernization incentive funds to Washington,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor has certified for release $97,729,219 in unemployment insurance modernization incentive funds to the state of Washington. The state qualified for its remaining share of the funds available under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act by including in its law provisions that assist workers who become unemployed because of compelling family reasons as well as workers who are upgrading their skills. ""Washington has made important updates to strengthen its state unemployment insurance system and take advantage of federal incentives,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""As our economy continues to recover, these common-sense improvements are helping working families, strengthening our communities and building a stronger 21st century workforce."" The Washington Employment Security Department can use the funds to pay unemployment benefits or, if appropriated by the legislature, for administering its unemployment insurance program or delivering employment services. ""With bipartisan support, the first bill our legislature passed this year made the changes necessary to receive these funds,"" Gov. Chris Gregoire said. ""This additional money will go into the unemployment trust fund to help pay benefits and keep taxes stable, and to help the Employment Security Division more efficiently serve the people of Washington."" The Recovery Act made a total of $7 billion available in UI modernization incentive payments to states that include certain eligibility provisions in their UI programs. Each state can qualify for a share of those funds by showing that its law includes those provisions. Washington's approved application will be posted on the department's Employment and Training Administration website at http://www.doleta.gov/recovery . Other approved applications can also be found on this site.

"June 28, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20110628,Statement by Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis on the retirement of Rep. Lynn Woolsey,"WASHINGTON – Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis today issued the following statement regarding the retirement of Rep. Lynn Woolsey of California: ""Congresswoman Woolsey is the rarest kind of leader in Washington. She is someone who truly understands the struggles of ordinary Americans because she has lived them. From her own humble background as a former welfare recipient to a fearless champion of the underdog in the halls of Congress, Lynn has spent her career in public service advocating for those whose voices are rarely heard. ""Lynn never sought acclaim. She never needed to gratify her own ego. She never needed to see her name in the klieg lights. She just wanted to do what was right, decent and just. Whether making the case for vulnerable women, immigrant families, public education or working-class Americans, Lynn was always on the side of the angels. ""From my earliest days as a public servant in California to my time as labor secretary today, I have always drawn strength and inspiration from Lynn's example. I wish her a happy and well-deserved retirement. Her leadership in Congress will be sorely missed."""
"June 28, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/owcp/owcp20110628,US Labor Department announces final rule updating procedures for Federal Workers Compensation Act claims,"Agency issues first major regulation updates since 1999 WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Labor's Office of Workers' Compensation Programs today released a final rule that revises and modernizes the procedures used in administering claims under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act. The rule, published in the June 28 Federal Register, modernizes those procedures to increase fairness and efficiency, updates the regulations to account for recent statutory changes and incorporates advances in technology that preserve administrative resources. ""This is the first substantial change to the FECA regulations since 1999,"" said OWCP acting Director Gary Steinberg. ""The new regulations take advantage of technological and other changes that will improve the fairness and efficiency of the claims process."" The rule also clarifies a number of current practices. Updates include acknowledging reorganization within the department and incorporating statutory changes, such as the new FECA death gratuity benefit. Changes also have been made to existing policies to improve the benefit program and lessen burdens on claimants. Additionally, the rule adds the skin as a covered organ retroactive to Sept. 11, 2001, under the act's schedule award provision, providing up to 205 weeks of compensation for burns, cancers and other medical conditions that impair the skin's function. The administrative and procedural changes include requiring employing agencies to file claims electronically by the end of 2012 and allowing for the use of video and teleconferences in hearings, as well as changes to the medical approval and procurement procedures. The final rule can be viewed at http://s.dol.gov/GI. The Office of Workers' Compensation Programs administers several disability benefit programs that cover federal workers, nuclear weapons workers, coal miners, longshore and harbor workers, and civilian contractors of the federal government who work overseas. These programs provide a variety of medical benefits, as well as wage replacement, vocational rehabilitation and other services. Benefits also may be paid to eligible dependents or survivors.

"June 28, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ofccp/ofccp20110628,US Labor Department restores and updates Functional Affirmative Action Program process for federal contractors and subcontractors,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs has released a new directive to outline the process by which federal supply and service contractors can apply for Functional Affirmative Action Program agreements, which can be viewed at http://www.dol.gov/ofccp/regs/compliance/directives/dir296.htm . ""The FAAP is back and is better than before,"" said OFCCP Director Patricia A. Shiu. ""Over the past year, I have listened to comments from the contractor community and employee groups, and determined that this is a useful tool for ensuring that federal contractors and subcontractors meet their obligations to provide equal employment opportunity for everyone. I am pleased to share updated guidance that responds to the feedback we received while also renewing our commitment to ensuring discrimination-free workplaces."" Under Executive Order 11246, any company with 50 or more employees and a federal contract of $50,000 or more is required to develop a written affirmative action program for each of its establishments. An AAP helps contractors identify and analyze potential disparities related to the employment of women and minorities. Where disparities exist, contractors can use AAPs to articulate specific procedures they will follow and good faith efforts they will make to provide equal employment opportunities. FAAP agreements allow large contractors the flexibility to create AAPs by functional or business units rather than by individual establishments. For example, a company could develop an affirmative action program for all sales associates across multiple offices in different states as opposed to creating one for each work site. OFCCP reviewed its policies regarding the FAAP process and made significant changes, including the requirement of written approval by the OFCCP director before contractors can begin developing FAAPs, thereby eliminating the provision for automatic approval if OFCCP failed to act upon the request within 120 days; shorter terms for FAAP agreements which will now expire after three years, instead of five, at which point a renewal will have to be approved; and the possibility of a compliance evaluation by OFCCP should contractors fail to submit the required annual updates to their FAAP agreements. All contractors who currently have an approved FAAP agreement will be required to renew it in accordance with the new guidance. Contractors without these agreements should continue to maintain and develop establishment-based AAPs. Answers to frequently asked questions about the FAAP can be found at http://www.dol.gov/ofccp/regs/compliance/faqs/faapfaqs.htm . The new guidance rescinds a previous directive, Administrative Notice/Functional AAP, issued March 21, 2002, and ends a yearlong suspension in the acceptance of requests to develop or renew FAAP agreements while the program was under review. In addition to Executive Order 11246, OFCCP's legal authority exists under Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974. As amended, these three laws hold those who do business with the federal government, both contractors and subcontractors, to the fair and reasonable standard that they not discriminate in employment on the basis of gender, race, color, religion, national origin, disability or status as a protected veteran.

""These funds will enable grantees currently serving these parents to establish mentoring programs so young people can receive this important extra support."" The grants cover a period of 48 months. Grantees are encouraged to serve young parents who are victims of child abuse, are homeless or have run away from home, are Native American/Indian, are migrants, have incarcerated parents, are involved with or at risk of involvement with court systems, have disabilities, and are in or aging out of foster care. They will participate in rigorous random assignment impact evaluations to assess the effectiveness of mentoring services based on numerous outcomes, including whether the individuals served are able to achieve employment.

"June 23, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20110623,"US Labor Department sues Dowe and Wagner of Richmond, Ill., to restore  more than $31,000 to company’s 401(k) plan for employees","ROCKFORD , Ill. – The U.S. Department of Labor has sued Dowe and Wagner Inc., a heating and air conditioning company in Richmond, and its co-owners, Joseph Wagner and Thomas Eppers, to restore $31,650 to the company’s 401(k) plan. The case resulted from an investigation by the department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration into alleged violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. “It is an egregious violation of trust when employees’ voluntary salary contributions are incorporated into the general assets of a company and not forwarded to their retirement plans,” said Steve Haugen, EBSA’s regional director in Chicago. “The Labor Department will continue to fight for workers when fiduciaries fail in their responsibilities to properly administer employee benefits.” The suit, filed in U.S. district court in Rockford, alleges that the company and its co-owners violated ERISA by failing to forward employee contributions to the plan from Oct. 6, 2006, through July 31, 2009. Those funds were retained in Dowe and Wagner’s general account and used to pay the company’s operating expenses. In addition, the defendants failed to remit employee contributions to the plan in a timely manner from Jan. 19, 2005, through Oct. 31, 2006. The suit seeks a court order to restore money owed to the plan, including lost opportunity costs, and to prevent the company and the two co-owners from serving as fiduciaries to any ERISA-covered employee benefit plan. It also seeks the appointment of an independent fiduciary to terminate the plan and distribute its assets to qualified participants and beneficiaries. EBSA protects the security of the retirement, health and other workplace-related benefits of America’s workers, retirees and their families. The agency oversees approximately 708,000 private sector retirement plans, 2.8 million health plans and a similar number of other workplace related benefit plans that provide benefits to more than 150 million Americans. Collectively, these plans hold more than $6 trillion in assets. Employers and workers can reach EBSA’s Chicago office at 312-353-0900 or toll-free at 866-444-3272 for help with problems related to private sector retirement and health plans.

Notice of the extension has been published in the June 22 Federal Register and can be viewed at http://s.dol.gov/GE. On April 26, OFCCP published a notice of proposed rulemaking in 76 Federal Register 23358 with a comment period scheduled to end on Monday, June 27. After receiving requests for an extension, OFCCP has extended the comment period by 14 days until Monday, July 11. This action will provide additional time for interested individuals to analyze the issues and provide their comments. To view the proposed rule and submit comments, visit the federal e-rulemaking portal at http://www.regulations.gov and search by regulation identification number 1250-AA00. The rule proposed by OFCCP would strengthen affirmative action provisions for protected veterans, detailing specific actions a contractor must take to satisfy its obligations under the law. The new rule would increase data collection obligations and require contractors to establish hiring benchmarks to measure the effectiveness of their affirmative action efforts; require contractors to engage in at least three specified types of outreach and recruitment efforts each year; and require that all job applicants be invited to self-identify as ""protected veterans"" before they are offered a job. In addition to VEVRAA, OFCCP's legal authority exists under Executive Order 11246 and Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. As amended, these three laws hold those who do business with the federal government, both contractors and subcontractors, to the fair and reasonable standard that they not discriminate in employment on the basis of gender, race, color, religion, national origin, disability or status as a protected veteran.

"June 20, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/olms/olms20110620,US Labor Department announces proposed rule concerning reporting on use of labor relations consultants,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Labor today announced a proposed rule to revise the interpretation of ""advice"" as it pertains to the employer and labor relations consultant persuader reporting requirements of Section 203 of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act. The proposal adopts the plain meaning of the term ""advice"" as ""an oral or written recommendation regarding a decision or course of conduct."" Section 203 of the LMRDA requires the disclosure of agreements or arrangements between employers and labor relations consultants when a consultant undertakes or agrees to undertake activities that seek to directly or indirectly persuade workers concerning whether or not to exercise, or the manner of exercising, their rights to organize and bargain collectively. Neither an employer nor a consultant is required to file a report with the Department of Labor covering the services of a consultant if the consultant is merely giving or agreeing to give advice to the employer. Under the proposal, an agreement would be reportable in any case where the consultant engages in persuader activities that go beyond the plain meaning of ""advice."" Reportable persuader activities would include those in which a consultant engages in any actions, conduct or communications on behalf of an employer that would directly or indirectly persuade workers concerning their rights to organize and bargain collectively, regardless of whether or not the consultant has direct contact with workers. An agreement also would be reportable in any case in which a consultant engages in specific persuader actions, conduct or communications regardless of whether advice is given, such as when a consultant plans or orchestrates a campaign or program to avoid or counter a union organizing or collective bargaining effort. The LMRDA does not regulate the actual persuader activities or statements, and the proposed rule only focuses on whether the activities would have to be publicly disclosed. The current interpretation of ""advice"" has resulted in significant underreporting of employer and consultant persuader agreements. Better disclosure is critical to helping workers make informed decisions about their right to organize and bargain collectively. The proposed rule will be published June 21 in the Federal Register and is available at http://s.dol.gov/G9. The public can submit comments online at http://www.regulations.gov (link is external) .

""Individuals from Guatemala and Nicaragua make important contributions to the U.S. economy, and their workplace rights should be protected,"" said Secretary Solis. ""I am pleased that the U.S., Guatemalan and Nicaraguan governments are working together to help make that happen"" The declarations will enable the regional enforcement offices of the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration and Wage and Hour Division to cooperate with local Guatemalan and Nicaraguan embassies and consulates to distribute information to migrant workers about U.S. health, safety and wage laws. Training also will be provided to both migrant workers and their employers. In conjunction with the declarations, letters of agreement were signed by the two agencies. The Wage and Hour Division will be able to protect migrant workers in low-wage industries such as hospitality and agriculture. OSHA will continue efforts to improve workplace safety and health conditions while simultaneously providing outreach and assistance to Spanish-speaking workers and employers. Additionally, through these agencies, the Labor Department will be better able to identify problems experienced by migrant workers and to target labor law enforcement efforts. OSHA, for example, will provide a toll-free telephone number staffed by multilingual operators who are ready, day and night, to receive calls from migrant workers about safety and health issues.

In addition to the financial remedy, TKE will extend 23 job offers to affected women as positions become available. TKE is a subsidiary of ThyssenKrupp AG, a global conglomerate based in Germany and one of the world's leading producers of elevators. TKE currently holds a $15.1 million contract to provide elevator and escalator maintenance to the General Services Administration, the U.S. federal government agency that manages most federal buildings. During a scheduled compliance review, OFCCP determined that TKE had violated Executive Order 11246, which prohibits federal contractors and subcontractors from discriminating on the basis of sex. ""This agreement sends a powerful message that the U.S. government will not tolerate discrimination,"" said OFCCP Director Patricia A. Shiu. ""A global company like ThyssenKrupp should know better than to underestimate the power of America's working women. When the doors of opportunity are fully open to us, there isn't a job that we can't do."" Under the terms of the agreement, in addition to paying wages and interest to affected female applicants who return timely notifications, ThyssenKrupp agreed to undertake extensive self-monitoring and corrective measures to ensure that all employment practices fully comply with the law, and to immediately correct any discriminatory practices. The company will contact the rejected applicants and make payments directly to them using address information supplied on the job applications. In addition to Executive Order 11246, OFCCP's legal authority exists under Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Act of 1974. Those who do business with the federal government, both contractors and subcontractors, are held to the fair and reasonable standard that they do not discriminate in employment on the basis of gender, race, color, religion, national origin, disability or status as a protected veteran.

"June 14, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20110614-0,US Labor Department's OSHA cites AL Solutions Inc. in West Virginia after deaths of 3 workers in explosion and fire,"Company added to Severe Violator Enforcement Program NEW CUMBERLAND, W.Va. The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration has cited AL Solutions Inc. for exposing workers to workplace safety and health hazards following an explosion and fire at the company's New Cumberland facility that caused the deaths of three workers. OSHA began an investigation in response to the incident that occurred Dec. 9, 2010. As a result, the company received citations for one willful, 16 serious and one other-than-serious violation. ""This tragedy could have been prevented,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for OSHA Dr. David Michaels. ""It is imperative that employers take steps to eliminate hazards and provide a safe working environment."" The willful violation is the company's use of an unsafe water sprinkler system with flammable metals, which created an explosion hazard. A willful violation is one committed with intentional knowing or voluntary disregard for the law's requirements, or with plain indifference to worker safety and health. Serious violations include the company's failure to provide a properly designed gas detection system for hydrogen, provide over-pressure protection, safely store flammable metals, provide safe egress, provide appropriate personal protective equipment, ensure the safe use of forklifts and provide hazard communication training. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known. The other-than-serious violation is the company's failure to maintain required record keeping by not completing OSHA Form 301, the Injury and Illness Incident Report. AL Solutions, which operates plants in New Cumberland and Washington, Mo., manufactures titanium and zirconium alloy compacts used in the aluminum manufacturing industry. Penalties total $154,000. The violations place this company in OSHA's Severe Violators Enforcement Program. Initiated in June 2010, SVEP is intended to focus OSHA enforcement resources on recalcitrant employers that endanger workers by committing willful, repeat or failure-to-abate violations in one or more of the following circumstances: a fatality or catastrophe; industry operations or processes that expose workers to severe occupational hazards; employee exposure to hazards related to the potential releases of highly hazardous chemicals; and all egregious enforcement actions. For more information about the program, visit http://www.osha.gov/dep/svep-directive.pdf . The company has 15 business days from receipt of the citations to comply, ask for an informal conference with OSHA's area director or contest the citations and proposed penalties before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. The investigation was conducted by OSHA's Charleston Area Office; telephone 304-347-5937. To report workplace incidents, fatalities or situations posing imminent danger to workers, call the agency's toll-free hotline at 800-321-OSHA (6742).

"June 14, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20110614,US Labor Department's OSHA proposes more than $1.9 million in fines against Alabama lumber mill for egregious and other safety violations,"PHENIX CITY , Ala. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration today proposed penalties of $1,939,000 to the Phenix Lumber Co. and its principal, John M. Dudley, for egregious and other safety violations, including exposing employees to amputation and fall hazards. Prior to these citations, Phenix Lumber had been cited 77 times by OSHA for serious safety and health violations since 2007. ""Phenix Lumber continues to put workers at risk by choosing not to implement safety measures that would prevent serious injuries to their employees,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""Employers have a responsibility to keep their workers safe and healthy. One worker injured on the job is one too many."" OSHA began an inspection on Dec. 15, 2010, in response to a complaint that employees working in the planer mill were exposed to amputation hazards while maintaining, cleaning and clearing jams on pieces of machinery that did not have their energy sources locked out to prevent their unexpected start up. Two months later, OSHA received a second complaint that an employee had suffered a partial finger amputation while clearing a piece of machinery that had not been locked out. At the opening of an inspection following the second complaint, the compliance officer learned of another employee who had just suffered a severe hand injury while working on unguarded machinery. Phenix Lumber had been cited numerous times during the past four years for allowing employees to work on unguarded machinery while it was operating. ""This situation reflects a systemic problem with the way this company approaches safety and demonstrates an egregious disregard for workers' safety and health,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for OSHA Dr. David Michaels. OSHA has issued Phenix Lumber 13 citations for 24 willful violations, including failure to properly shut down and lock out 13 pieces of machinery before employees were required to perform tasks such as clearing jams and cleaning. These failures exposed employees to amputation hazards, as well as to the possibility of being caught between or struck by pieces of the machinery and falling lumber. The employer also failed to train 11 employees who performed this work on the hazards and how to shut down and lock out the machinery so that they could perform their tasks safely. OSHA proposed the maximum $70,000 penalty for each violation, totaling $1,680,000. Citations for three additional willful violations allege that a worker was exposed to fall hazards while working from the top of a machine, locks were not issued to employees as required by the lockout standard, and the company failed to follow established lockout/tagout procedures. These citations carry additional penalties of $70,000 each, for a total of $210,000. A willful violation is one committed with intentional knowing or voluntary disregard for the law's requirements, or with plain indifference to worker safety and health. OSHA may propose separate penalties for distinct willful violations of the same OSHA standard where one or more of the seven criteria are met as identified in the OSHA directive ""Handling of Cases to be Proposed for Violation-By-Violation"" (compliance directive 02-00-080). The criteria include that the employer's conduct taken as a whole amounts to clear bad faith in the performance of duties under the Occupational Safety and Health Act. One citation for a repeat violation with a $35,000 fine was issued for failing to place machine guards on seven chains and sprockets. A violation is ""repeated"" if the employer previously was cited for a substantially similar condition, and the citation is a final, affirmed order of the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. This time is the third within three years that Phenix Lumber has been cited for failing to guard this type of equipment. Citations for two serious violations, each with a maximum proposed penalty of $7,000, were issued for failing to guard a pinch point at a hydraulic pusher plate, which exposed employees to amputation hazards and caused one of the injuries; and to ensure that employees performing lockout/tagout tasks applied and removed their own locks. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known. Copies of the citations are available at http://www.osha.gov/dep/citations/MDLGPhenixLumber315135954.pdf and http://www.osha.gov/dep/citations/MDLGPhenixLumber315111930.pdf . OSHA has proposed that the employer be included in the agency's Severe Violators Enforcement Program. Initiated in 2010, the program is intended to focus on employers that endanger workers by committing willful, repeat or failure-to-abate violations in one or more of the following circumstances: a fatality or catastrophe; industry operations or processes that expose workers to severe occupational hazards; exposure to hazards related to the potential releases of highly hazardous chemicals; and all instance-by-instance enforcement actions under compliance directive 02-00-080. Inclusion in the program subjects employers to mandatory follow-up inspections; increased company/corporate awareness of OSHA enforcement; and, where appropriate, corporate-wide agreements, enhanced settlement provisions and federal court enforcement under Section 11(b) of the OSH Act. For more information, visit http://www.osha.gov/dep/svep-directive.pdf . Phenix Lumber and Dudley have 15 business days from receipt of the citations and proposed penalties to comply, request a conference with OSHA's area director or contest the findings before the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.

"June 14, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20110614,"US Labor Department recovers $1.3 million in back wages and fringe benefits for employees of Chelsea, Mass., contractor working on Long Island, NY","CAL Construction and owner debarred from federal contracts for 3 years WESTBURY , N.Y. — The U.S. Department of Labor has recovered $1.3 million in unpaid prevailing wages and fringe benefits for 67 employees of CAL Construction Co. Inc., a Chelsea, Mass.-based contractor, for work performed on a Long Island, N.Y., low-income housing project funded in part by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The company and owner Cesar A. Lemus, in addition to making this payment, have been debarred from bidding or working on future federally funded contracts for a period of three years. ""The Labor Department will not tolerate federal contractors taking advantage of workers,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""Debarring contractors such as CAL Construction from future contracts helps to ensure a level-playing field. We will hold companies doing business with the federal government accountable for complying with the law."" The Long Island District Office of the department's Wage and Hour Division, located in Westbury, conducted an investigation that found CAL Construction and Lemus willfully violated the Davis-Bacon and Related Acts by underpaying employees performing a variety of trades, including carpentry, painting, tile work and building laborer work on the Bedell Terrace Apartments rehab project in Hempstead, N.Y., from December 2009 to the end of October 2010. The company also violated provisions of the Copeland Act and the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act. The Recovery Act incorporates provisions of the DBRA, which requires the payment of prevailing wages and benefits to laborers and mechanics employed on federal and certain federally funded projects. The division's investigation found that some workers were paid only a fraction of the prevailing wages and fringe benefits due, frequently 50-60 percent less per hour than the required prevailing wage rates, and that the company paid workers both on and off the books. CAL Construction also failed to pay required fringe benefits to its nonunion workers, as well as to members of two local trade unions that supplied some additional workers to the housing project. Workers who were transported to the Bedell Terrace project from their homes in Massachusetts were not paid the cost of their lodging by CAL Construction, resulting in additional violations of the DBRA's prevailing wage requirements. CAL Construction also violated the provisions of the Copeland Act by submitting falsified certified payrolls to the government. Additionally, the company did not pay workers time and one-half the base rate of pay for hours worked over 40 in a workweek, a violation of the CWHSSA. Furthermore, it required many employees to pay back a portion of their wages to the company each week, and coerced employees into not cooperating with the Wage and Hour Division during the course of the investigation. A Labor Department administrative law judge has issued an order approving consent findings agreed to by CAL Construction, Lemus and the Wage and Hour Division resolving this matter. The prime contractor on the Bedell Terrace Apartments project was Omni of NY LLC, while the first tier subcontractor was Renewal Construction Services LLC. CAL Construction was a subcontractor to both of those companies on the project. The Labor Department is continuing to review a number of other subcontractors on the Bedell Terrace project to determine their compliance with the DBRA.

"June 10, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20110610,"US Department of Labor's OSHA proposes more than $243,000 in fines against Lewiston, Maine, contractor for egregious fall hazards, other violations","Lessard Brothers Construction employees exposed to 23-foot falls AUGUSTA, Maine – A Lewiston roofing contractor with a long history of violating workplace safety standards faces a total of $243,360 in proposed fines from the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration following a December 2010 inspection that resulted in citations for alleged egregious willful, serious and repeat violations for a lack of fall protection and other hazards. OSHA previously had cited Lessard Brothers Construction Inc. and its predecessor, Lessard Roofing & Siding Inc., 10 times for fall protection violations at various Maine work sites. OSHA inspectors found four Lessard employees exposed to potentially life-threatening falls of 23 feet while working without fall protection on a steep-pitched roof at a work site on Elm Street in Lewiston. Due to management's knowledge of the hazard and the required safeguards, along with the company's extensive history of violations, Lessard was cited for four egregious willful violations with $224,000 in proposed fines. A willful violation is one committed with intentional knowing or voluntary disregard for the law's requirements, or with plain indifference to worker safety and health. ""This employer ignored the law and put workers' lives at risk,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for OSHA Dr. David Michaels. ""OSHA's commonsense regulations save lives. Employers who ignore these regulations and endanger their employees will face the consequences."" In addition, Lessard was cited for two serious violations with $10,560 in proposed fines for an electrical hazard, and for failing to train workers on electrical hazards and fall protection. The company also was cited for one repeat violation with a proposed fine of $8,800 for a lack of hard hat protection. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known. A repeat violation exists when an employer previously has been cited for the same or a similar violation of a standard, regulation, rule or order at any other facility in federal enforcement states within the last five years. The repeat citation stems from OSHA having cited the company in January 2010 for a similar hazard at a Bath, Maine, work site. ""Falls are the number one killer in construction work,"" said Marthe Kent, OSHA's New England regional administrator. ""Employees in situations such as this are just one slip, trip or misstep away from a fatal or disabling fall. Responsible employers must ensure that effective fall protection measures are in place and in use every day on every job site."" This significant enforcement action qualifies Lessard Brothers Construction for OSHA's Severe Violators Enforcement Program, which mandates targeted follow-up inspections to ensure compliance with the law. Initiated in 2010, SVEP focuses on recalcitrant employers that endanger workers by committing willful, repeat or failure-to-abate violations. For more information on the program, visit http://www.osha.gov/dep/svep-directive.pdf . Detailed information on fall protection hazards and safeguards is available online at http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/fallprotection/construction.html . Since Oct. 28, 2010, according to Maine's workers' compensation insurance verification system, Lessard Brothers Construction has been without workers' compensation insurance coverage. The employer has 15 business days from receipt of its citations and proposed penalties to comply, meet with OSHA's area director or contest the findings before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. The inspection was conducted by OSHA's Augusta Area Office; telephone 207-626-9160.

While rural communities face challenges, they also present economic potential. To address these challenges, build on the administration's rural economic strategy and improve the implementation of that strategy, the president signed an executive order establishing the White House Rural Council. ""Strong rural communities are key to a stronger America,"" said President Barack Obama. ""That's why I've established the White House Rural Council to make sure we're working across government to strengthen rural communities and promote economic growth."" The White House Rural Council will coordinate programs across government to encourage public-private partnerships to promote further economic prosperity and quality of life in rural communities nationwide. Chaired by Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack, the council will be responsible for providing recommendations for investment in rural areas and will coordinate federal engagement with a variety of rural stakeholders, including agricultural organizations, small businesses, and state, local and tribal governments. ""Rural America makes significant contributions to the security, prosperity and economic strength of our country,"" said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. ""The Rural Council announced by President Obama shows his continued focus on promoting economic opportunity, creating jobs and enhancing the quality of life for those who live in rural America. Together with the rest of the Obama administration, USDA has worked to support families and businesses in rural communities so that their success will pay dividends for all Americans."" In the coming months, the White House Rural Council will focus on job creation and economic development by increasing the flow of capital to rural areas, promoting innovation, expanding digital and physical networks, and celebrating opportunity through America's natural resources. The council will begin discussing key factors for growth, including: Jobs: improve job training and workforce development in rural America. Agriculture: expand markets for agriculture, including regional food systems and exports. Access to credit: increase opportunity by expanding access to capital in rural communities and fostering local investment. Innovation: promote the expansion of biofuels production capacity and community-based renewable energy projects.

""Safe and healthy workplaces and a local workforce prepared for the jobs of the 21st century are vital to sustaining strong rural communities,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""The Rural Council will help the Labor Department more effectively support greater coordination among businesses, rural workers and government resources. The result will be safer, more innovative and more competitive workplaces, and greater prosperity for our nation."" Since taking office, President Obama's administration has taken significant steps to improve the lives of rural Americans and has provided broad support for rural communities. The Obama administration has set goals of modernizing infrastructure by providing broadband access to 10 million Americans, expanding educational opportunities for students in rural areas and providing affordable health care. In the long term, these unparalleled rural investments will help ensure that America's rural communities are repopulating, self-sustaining and thriving economically. View the Executive Order (PDF)"

The division investigated the Hammonton blueberry farm as part of its annual inspection of migrant farms in 2008, 2009 and 2010, and cited violations of the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act, including the farm's failure to post housing conditions and ensure housing safety and health, use of an unregistered crew leader, overcrowding, failure to provide safe transport, failure to ensure drivers were licensed and failure to register employees. The farm also was cited for employing individuals under the age of 12 and not maintaining a record of these minor employees, which is required under the Fair Labor Standards Act, as well as failing to meet field sanitation requirements under the Occupational Safety and Health Act. An order approving settlement was signed on Jan. 20, 2011, by Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission Administrative Law Judge Covette Rooney. The matter before the commission was prompted by a Wage and Hour Division investigation under the field sanitation standards of the OSH Act. A second order was signed by Department of Labor Chief Administrative Law Judge Stephen L. Purcell on May 20, 2011, also after investigation and findings of violation by the Wage and Hour Division. Under the orders, in addition to paying the civil money penalties, Anthony and William DiMeo have agreed to ensure that any facility or real-property they own or control that is used as housing for migrant agricultural workers complies with federal and state safety and health standards applicable to that housing; ensure that facilities they own or control which are used as housing for migrant and seasonal agricultural workers are certified by state or local authority as meeting applicable safety and health standards and have a certificate of occupancy; and ensure that vehicles used to transport migrant or seasonal agricultural workers comply with federally mandated motor safety standards. In addition, they must ensure that farm labor contractors or any other people who drive vehicles used to transport migrant and seasonal agricultural workers have a valid and appropriate state-issued driver's license; that each vehicle used to transport migrant and seasonal agricultural workers has an insurance policy; and that any farm labor contractor or employee of a farm labor contractor is registered. Rinvil, a farm labor contractor who led a crew of farm workers for Columbia Farms, has agreed that he will not perform any farm labor contracting activity without first obtaining a certificate or registration from the U.S. Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division or perform any farm labor contracting activity that is not authorized by the certificate of registration. ""This precedent-setting agreement will go a long way in protecting the interests of workers employed by this farm, as well as others in the industry,"" said Patrick Reilly, director of the division's Southern New Jersey District Office. ""The Labor Department is committed to using all legal options to ensure that violators of federal laws are held accountable."" In working with the Wage and Hour Division, in an effort to address the violations, Columbia Fruit Farms has taken several steps to ensure full compliance with MSPA. The farm has constructed five new buildings for migrant housing and purchased an additional farm with housing facilities, bringing the total number of housing units to 400 occupants. Also, as part of a three-year plan that began in 2007, the farm constructed new bathroom and kitchen facilities, adding 28 showers, 48 washtubs and a new kitchen at one of the camp sites. Lockers were installed at all facilities in direct response to a deficiency noted in the Wage and Hour Division's inspection. The Wage and Hour Division enforces worker protection laws that include the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Migrant and Seasonal Worker Protection Act, and the Occupational Safety and Health Act's field sanitation and temporary labor camp provisions. The FLSA sets standards for minimum wage, overtime compensation and child labor. The law allows, with restrictions, the employment of individuals between ages 12 and 16 as farmworkers. There are no restrictions on workers age 16 and older employed in farm jobs. The FLSA prohibits the employment of most individuals under age 16 in hazardous occupations. Youths of any age may work at any time and perform any job on a farm owned or operated by their parents. Otherwise, individuals under age 12 may not be employed in farm activities. The investigations were conducted by the Wage and Hour Division's Southern New Jersey District Office. Information on federal laws concerning migrant and seasonal agricultural workers, as well as child labor, is available by calling the Department of Labor's toll-free helpline at 866-4US-WAGE (487-9243) or on the Internet at http://www.dol.gov/whd/ .

The suit seeks back wages of more than $1 million, plus liquidated damages. The complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court of the Western District of Texas, Austin Division. After an in-depth investigation into CPS' practices statewide, the department's Wage and Hour Division determined that the employees were working ""off the clock"" rather than compensated for all hours worked. Additionally, supervisors were instructing employees not to record all of their hours worked. Further, required record keeping was not maintained. ""Civil servants entrusted with the important job of protecting Texas' children were forced to relinquish their wage protections,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""The Labor Department's job is to protect workers from such violations of the law, and we are taking the necessary actions to ensure these employees are properly paid."" The investigation by the Wage and Hour Division's San Antonio office, covering the three-year period from June 2008 to the present, found that CPS willfully violated the FLSA by failing to pay employees for all hours worked over 40 in a week. In 2000, the Labor Department filed a similar lawsuit against another Texas state agency. After extensive litigation, the state ultimately paid $2 million to settle that case. The FLSA requires that covered employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 for all hours worked, plus time and one-half their regular rates of pay, including commissions, bonuses and incentive pay, for hours worked beyond 40 per week. Employers must also maintain accurate time and payroll records. For more information about the FLSA and other federal wage laws, call the Wage and Hour Division's toll-free helpline at 866-4US-WAGE (487-9243) or the division's San Antonio District Office at 210-308-4515.

"June 8, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20110608,Texas union official sentenced for stealing from training and apprenticeship fund following US Labor Department investigation,"PORT ARTHUR , Texas - The U.S. Department of Labor has announced that Michael Doggett, business representative for the Carpenters Local Union 502 in Port Arthur, has been sentenced to five months in prison and ordered to make $39,324 in restitution payments for embezzling from a union benefit plan. Doggett pleaded guilty in January to one count of theft from the Carpenters and Millwrights Local 502 Joint Apprenticeship Training Committee Fund. He served as the union’s training program director and secretary-treasurer from September 2000 until December 2009. Doggett was responsible for overseeing and administering the program’s finances, including payment for expenses, collecting dues and paying property taxes. “I hope that this case sends a clear message to all who hold an office of trust, or operate or administer apprenticeship and training programs, that the Department of Labor is committed to vigorously pursuing those who abuse their positions and use program funds for personal gain,” said Roger Hilburn, director of the Dallas Regional Office of the Labor Department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration. “We remain committed to eliminating corruption and protecting training plan assets for the exclusive benefit of apprentices.” “This sentencing shows that justice will be done for those union officers and employees who do not handle union funds prudently and for the benefit of their fellow hard-working members, as required by law,” said Michelle Hussar, director of the Dallas District Office of the Labor Department’s Office of Labor-Management Standards. From Oct. 1, 2005, through Dec. 31, 2009, Doggett embezzled from the apprenticeship and training benefit plan, using the money for items including, but not limited to, bowling, food and beverages, a dating service, car expenses, payments to family and relatives, overdraft fees, payroll, personal payments to other individuals, Internet services, cable services, utility bills and lodging. An indictment was handed down in September 2010 charging Doggett with stealing from the benefit plan, as well as more than $45,000 from the Local 502 general fund, which he used for personal expenses. As part of the plea agreement, the charge of stealing from the union general fund was dismissed. Doggett is scheduled to begin his sentence June 27. After completion of his jail term, he has been ordered to spend an additional five months in home detention and is barred from serving as a union officer or employee for 13 years. The department’s investigation was conducted by EBSA’s Dallas Regional Office, OLMS’ Dallas District Office and the FBI. The case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert L. Rawls.

The action resolves a lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Labor in May 2010 alleging that the company discriminated against female sales specialists by paying them salaries that were, on average, $1,700 less than their male counterparts. The department's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs conducted a scheduled compliance review of the business center in 2002 and found that AstraZeneca had violated Executive Order 11246 by failing to meet its obligations as a federal contractor to ensure employees were paid fairly without regard to sex, race, color, religion and national origin. AstraZeneca holds a contract valued at more than $2 billion with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to provide pharmaceutical products to hospitals and medical centers around the country. ""Forty-eight years after President Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act, women are still fighting for fundamental fairness when it comes to how we are paid,"" said OFCCP Director Patricia A. Shiu, a member of President Obama's National Equal Pay Enforcement Task Force. ""I am glad AstraZeneca finally has agreed to pay its employees what they've earned. More importantly, we look forward to working with the company's management to make sure this does not happen again to anyone who works for AstraZeneca."" Under a consent decree and order filed with the department's Office of Administrative Law Judges, in addition to making financial restitution, the company has agreed to work with OFCCP to conduct a statistical analysis of the base pay of 415 individuals employed full time as ""primary care"" and ""specialty care"" level III pharmaceutical sales specialists in Alabama, Delaware, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia. If the analysis concludes that female employees continue to be underpaid, the company will adjust salaries accordingly. Finally, AstraZeneca has agreed to develop and annually update its affirmative action plan and keep all supporting documentation as required by law. If the company fails to comply with the consent decree, it may be subject to sanctions, including cancellation of its current federal contract and debarment from acquiring future ones. In addition to Executive Order 11246, OFCCP's legal authority exists under Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974. As amended, these three laws hold those who do business with the federal government, both contractors and subcontractors, to the fair and reasonable standard that they not discriminate in employment on the basis of sex, race, color, religion, national origin, disability or status as a protected veteran.

Solis issued the following statement on the May 2011 Employment Situation report released today: ""Our nation's labor market continued to add jobs in the month of May. Nonfarm payroll employment added 54,000 jobs, while the unemployment rate registered at 9.1 percent. ""While our rate of job growth slowed last month, we added 83,000 private sector jobs in May, and our economy continues to grow. We've now had 15 straight months of private sector job growth and added 2.1 million jobs over this period. ""We are making progress, but we need to do even more to put Americans back to work. As we debate the nation's budget and work to address the deficit, we must continue to make smart investments in our infrastructure and in new industries like clean energy and alternative fuels to help to grow our economy and create more jobs for Americans here at home. ""One impact on the May job numbers was a reduction in the government workforce. We have lost 73,000 government jobs in the last three months. As states and localities make budget decisions, they should cut judiciously because their decisions have an impact on jobs and the direction of our economy. Also, policymakers should resolve the debt ceiling issue to reduce market uncertainty and bolster consumer confidence so more businesses will reinvest in our economy and continue to create American jobs. ""While I would have liked to have seen stronger growth in May, we are still on the right trajectory. With smart investments and the determination of the American people, we will continue on our path toward a full recovery."""

Assistance to be provided includes job training and employment preparation, mentoring and connections to support services such as housing, substance abuse programs and mental health treatment. These grants represent the fourth generation of the Reintegration of Ex-Offenders-Adult program, which previously was called the Prisoner Re-entry Initiative and first funded in 2005. Each year, approximately 650,000 inmates are released from state and federal prisons, and return to their communities and families. Without assistance to make a successful transition, the majority of former offenders return to criminal activity. In order to successfully reintegrate into their communities, it is essential that these individuals have the skills and support necessary to compete for and obtain jobs.

"May 31, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20110531,US Labor Department announces about $20 million to fund state-run programs aimed at improving employment outcomes for people with disabilities,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor today announced the availability of approximately $20 million to fund programs that will improve education, training and employment opportunities for adults and youth with disabilities. A solicitation for grant applications is published in today's edition of the Federal Register. The Disability Employment Initiative is a joint project of the Labor Department's Employment and Training Administration and its Office of Disability Employment Policy. Programs to be funded will serve individuals who are unemployed, underemployed and/or receiving Social Security disability benefits. The goals of the project are to improve coordination and collaboration across multiple service delivery systems, build effective partnerships that leverage public and private resources to better serve people with disabilities and, ultimately, improve employment outcomes of people with disabilities. ""Workers with disabilities suffer from one of the lowest employment rates of any group in the American population, even in times of prosperity,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""It is vital that state and local agencies work together with private sector partners to improve these statistics. Through this second round of funding, we are expanding the Disability Employment Initiative to include programs in additional states."" Grantees under the Disability Employment Initiative are state workforce agencies. Nine – in Alaska, Arkansas, Delaware, Illinois, Kansas, Maine, New Jersey, New York and Virginia – received grants through a first round of funding awarded in September 2010 for a period of three years. This solicitation for applications represents a second round of funding; agencies in the remaining 41 states are eligible to apply. Recipient state workforce agencies will collaborate with workforce investment boards and local agencies. Awards will range from $1.5 to $6 million each to be spent over a three-year period. Cooperative agreements will be used to expand service delivery through the public workforce system to job seekers with disabilities. The programs will build upon the Labor Department's Disability Program Navigator initiative and other model service delivery strategies. Training and employment services supported by these grants are intended to help reduce the unacceptably low employment rates experienced by people with disabilities.

"May 31, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20110531-0,US Department of Labor to extend and align applicability dates for retirement plan fee disclosure rules,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor's Employee Benefits Security Administration has announced that it will publish in tomorrow's Federal Register a notice proposing to extend and align the applicability dates for its retirement plan fee disclosure rules. The department published an interim final 408(b)(2) regulation on July 16, 2010, requiring retirement plan service providers to disclose comprehensive information about their fees and potential conflicts of interest to plan fiduciaries. Although the new requirements are scheduled to apply to plan contracts or arrangements for services in existence on or after July 16, 2011, the department previously announced its intention to extend the deadline to Jan. 1, 2012. Today's proposal, when finalized, would make the extension official. The department recognizes that because a final rule is not yet in place, service providers may need additional time for compliance. The department also published a final participant-level regulation on Oct. 20, 2010, requiring that employers disclose information about plan and investment costs to workers who direct their own investments. This regulation applies for plan years beginning on or after Nov. 1, 2011, with a 60-day transition provision. The department's proposal would amend the regulation's transitional rule so that employers would have up to 120 days to furnish initial disclosures to workers. This amendment will ensure that employers obtain the information they need from service providers in order to satisfy their disclosure obligations to their workers. ""We want employers and workers to benefit from the increased transparency provided by these rules as soon as possible,"" said Phyllis C. Borzi, assistant labor secretary for employee benefits security. ""But we also appreciate that service providers may need more time for compliance efforts, because they have not yet seen a final Employee Retirement Income Security Act Section 408(b)(2) regulation. This action will provide that plan fiduciaries have all required information from service providers before they must disclose information to their workers, ensuring that workers receive accurate information about their retirement plan and investment costs."" Additional information about the fee disclosure regulations is available on EBSA's Web pages at http://www.dol.gov/ebsa.

"May 26, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20110526-0,"Administrative law judge upholds OSHA citation issued to Peoria, Ill.-based Caterpillar Logistics Services","Affirms musculoskeletal disorder should be recorded on OSHA 300 Injury and Illness Log PEORIA , Ill. An administrative law judge with the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission in Denver, Colo., has affirmed an other-than-serious safety citation issued to Peoria-based Caterpillar Logistics Services by the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration in June 2009. The company was cited for failing to record a worker's musculoskeletal disorder on the company's OSHA 300 log and assessed a proposed penalty of $900. ""Musculoskeletal disorders are very prevalent and are significant workplace injuries and illnesses,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for OSHA Dr. David Michaels, who praised the decision. ""It is imperative that these types of work-related illnesses are logged appropriately so workers and managers are made aware of them as well as their causes, and so that we can all learn how to better protect workers. By working together, OSHA, along with business leaders, union representatives and workers, can improve conditions and processes to prevent injuries and illnesses for all our nation's workers."" The citation was issued after an OSHA investigation determined that the company had failed to record a work-related musculoskeletal illness, epicondylitis, on the company's OSHA 300 log. Caterpillar contended that the employee's epicondylitis was not work-related. Administrative Law Judge Patrick Augustine noted that, in order to be recordable, ""an employee's work activities do not have to be the cause, but rather a cause of injury or illness,"" and determined that the preponderance of evidence showed the employee's work activities were at least a contributing, if not the sole, cause of the employee's epicondylitis. OSHRC is an independent federal agency created to decide contests of citations and/or penalties resulting from inspections of American workplaces by OSHA. An employer that is cited by OSHA for an alleged workplace health or safety violation can contest a citation and have the case heard by a commission administrative law judge, who ultimately issues a decision. The decision can then be appealed to the commission, whose members are presidential appointees. This decision is the first to address whether a musculoskeletal disorder is work-related under an OSHA record-keeping standard revised in 2001. Employers and employees with questions regarding workplace safety and health standards can call OSHA's Peoria Area Office at 309-589-7033. To report workplace incidents, fatalities or situations posing imminent danger to workers, call the agency's toll-free hotline at 800-321-OSHA (6742). Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. OSHA's role is to ensure these conditions for America's working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education and assistance.

"May 26, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20110526,"US Labor Departments OSHA announces final rule to reduce employer burdens by removing outdated requirements, streamlining and simplifying standards","WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration today announced the forthcoming release of a final rule that streamlines and simplifies standards while reducing employer burdens. The rule, which soon will be published in the Federal Register , will help keep OSHA standards up-to-date and better enable employers to comply with their regulatory obligations. ""The final rule is the third in OSHA's Standards Improvement Projects initiative that periodically reviews OSHA regulations with the goal of improving and eliminating those that are confusing, outdated, duplicative or inconsistent,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for OSHA Dr. David Michaels. ""OSHA estimates that the final rule, without reducing employee protection, will result in annual cost savings to employers exceeding $43 million and significant reductions in paperwork burden hours."" These updates will be in line with the goals of the president's Executive Order 13563, ""Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review,"" issued Jan. 18 to simplify standards and reduce unnecessary regulatory burdens. The executive order is available at http://www.regulations.gov/exchange/sites/dolgov/files/legacy-files/doc_files/President's%20Executive%20Order%2013563_0.pdf . The rule will update OSHA's standards and identify requirements for revision based on an agency review, comments from the public and recommendations from an Office of Management and Budget report (Regulatory Reform of the U.S. Manufacturing Sector, 2005). It builds on the success of SIP-Phase I published June 18, 1998, and SIP-Phase II published Jan. 5, 2005. The new rule will result in several changes to OSHA's existing respiratory protection standard, including aligning air cylinder testing requirements for self-contained breathing apparatuses with U.S. Department of Transportation regulations, clarifying that aftermarket cylinders meet National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health quality assurance requirements and clarifying that the provisions of Appendix D, which contains information for employees using respirators when not required under the standard, are mandatory if the employee chooses to use a respirator. Other changes to result from the new rule will include updating the definition of the term ""potable water"" to be consistent with the current Environmental Protection Agency standards instead of the former and outdated Public Health Service Corps definition, removing the outdated requirement that hand dryers use warm air because new technology allows employers to use hand-drying products that do not involve hot or warm air and removing two medical record requirements from the commercial-diving standard because that standard no longer requires medical examinations. Updates also will include deleting a number of requirements for employers to transmit exposure and medical records to NIOSH, thus saving NIOSH significant costs to store and maintain the records. According to NIOSH, these records did not serve a useful research purpose. The slings standards also will be updated and streamlined by requiring that employers use only slings marked with manufacturers' loading information. There will not be any new requirements set by this rule, so employers will be able to comply with it immediately. Regulatory text on the SIP-Phase III final rule will be published in the Federal Register. Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. OSHA's role is to ensure these conditions for America's working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education and assistance.

"May 26, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20110526,Judge finds Decatur-Ill. Mexican restaurants liable for more than $1 million in back wages and damages after US Labor Department investigation,"URBANA , Ill. — A federal judge in Urbana has ordered Dolores Onate, owner, and Ricardo Onate, manager, of the El Matador Inc. and El Caporal Inc. restaurants in Decatur to pay a total of $1,149,702.50 in back wages and damages to 64 workers employed as servers and kitchen staff. This judgment resolves a lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Labor following an investigation by its Wage and Hour Division that disclosed willful violations of the minimum wage, overtime pay and record-keeping provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act at three locations. ""The defendants in this case willfully and repeatedly violated federal labor standards, including forcing their employees to repay wages in an effort to conceal their own violations,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""As a result of the Labor Department's enforcement efforts, these vulnerable workers will receive their rightful pay."" The judgment requires the defendants to pay $387,429.87 due to 34 employees at two restaurants operated by El Matador and $187, 421.41 due to 30 employees at one restaurant operated by El Caporal, plus an equal amount in liquidated damages. This case was litigated by the department's regional solicitor in Chicago. The Wage and Hour Division's investigation found that some employees at all three restaurants did not receive any proceeds from paychecks they received. Wait staff, for example, took home only tips from customers they served. Although they were given paychecks by their employer, they then were required to return those payments to the restaurants. The investigation also found that employees who did not work as servers — such as kitchen staff, busboys and dishwashers — were not paid the minimum wage or overtime compensation and were required to return some of the money from their paychecks to the restaurant. Additionally, employees often were directed to punch or sign in at a predetermined time, even though they actually had begun working much earlier. In his written decision, Chief Judge Michael B. McCuskey noted that ""defendants instituted a pay practice in which servers endorsed their paychecks to the restaurant and only received tips from the clientele. Although payroll records reflect that paychecks to servers were cashed, the servers received none of the check proceeds. Some employees were instructed not to record all of the hours that they worked. These intentional efforts to conceal defendants' noncompliance with the FLSA resulted in false payroll records and demonstrate that the violations of the FLSA were willful."" The court further held the defendants liable for payment of the full minimum wage to the servers. No part of the minimum wage obligation was deemed satisfied with credit for tips servers received from customers. An earlier investigation by the Wage and Hour Division was conducted in October and November 2005 at one of the restaurants operated by El Matador. At that time, Ricardo Onate was provided with materials and information to ensure knowledge of and compliance with the FLSA. Wage and Hour Division posters reflecting workers' rights were posted at all three restaurants. Employers of ""tipped employees"" must pay either a cash wage of at least $2.13 per hour if they claim a tip credit against their federal minimum wage obligation, or the state mandated cash wage, whichever is greater. If an employee's tips combined with the employer's cash wage do not equal the required minimum hourly wage, the employer must make up the difference. The employer must also inform the tipped employees of the intent to treat tips as satisfying part of the employer's minimum wage obligation, and the tipped employees must be able to retain all of their tips, although they may participate in a valid tip-pooling arrangement. The FLSA requires that covered employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 for all hours worked, plus time and one-half their regular hourly rates of pay for hours worked beyond 40 per week. Additionally, the law requires employers to maintain accurate time and payroll records, and prohibits retaliation against employees who exercise their rights under the law.

"May 25, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20110525,US Department of Labors OSHA fines employer more than $1.2 million for exposing workers to asbestos hazards without protection,"CICERO , Ill. The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration has issued penalties of $1,247,400 to AMD Industries Inc. in Cicero after five unprotected and untrained workers allegedly were required to conduct asbestos removal exposing them to this cancer-causing material. The company was issued 19 willful and eight serious health citations following an OSHA inspection at its facilities in December 2010, in response to a referral from the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency. ""AMD failed in its duty to protect the health and safety of its workers,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""Such disregard will not be tolerated by the Labor Department. No one should risk serious illness or death to earn a paycheck."" OSHA investigators found that AMD Industries had commissioned a safety audit of its Cicero facility in 2002, which uncovered the presence of asbestos-containing materials on boilers, heating units and connected piping. In November 2010, the company began an asbestos removal project using in-house and untrained workers. The Illinois Environmental Protection Agency became aware of the work and asked the Illinois Attorney General's Office to proceed with an enforcement action for the improper removal, handling and disposal of asbestos-containing material. An agreed order was entered into by the company to implement a program to remediate the asbestos contamination. Workers allegedly were exposed to materials containing 20-50 percent asbestos. ""Asbestos exposure can be deadly,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health Dr. David Michaels. ""AMD Industries knew it was assigning workers to asbestos removal work and failed to take the most basic safety precautions. This employer did not provide protective respirators or even warn the workers of the risk to their health from removing the material."" OSHA issued 15 willful citations, with proposed penalties of $945,000, for the employer's failures to provide the employees engaged in the hazardous work with the proper training, and protective clothing and equipment. Proper protective clothing is required to make sure employees do not carry asbestos fibers outside of the facility and into their cars and homes. Additionally, AMD Industries was fined $252,000 for four willful violations for the following alleged failures: to identify or inform workers of the location and quantity of asbestos; to monitor airborne concentrations of asbestos; to use high-efficiency particulate air vacuums and wet methods to control the dust; and to promptly and properly dispose of asbestos-contaminated waste. A willful violation exists when an employer has demonstrated either an intentional disregard for the requirements of the law or plain indifference to employee safety and health. OSHA also issued eight serious citations, with proposed fines of $50,400, for failing to implement a respirator protection program; failing to use engineering controls and work practices for Class I asbestos work; not conducting asbestos work in regulated areas; and failing to provide hygiene facilities for workers removing the dangerous material. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known. A copy of the citations is available at http://www.osha.gov/dep/citations/AMD-Industries.pdf . This investigation falls under the requirements of OSHA's Severe Violators Enforcement Program. Initiated in the spring of 2010, the program focuses on recalcitrant employers that endanger workers by committing willful, repeat or failure-to-abate violations. For more information, visit http://www.osha.gov/dep/svep-directive.pdf . AMD Industries has 15 business days from receipt of its citations and penalties to comply, request an informal conference with OSHA's area director or contest the findings before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.

As many as 19,000 employers nationwide will receive the Baseline Survey of Safety and Health Practices, which asks questions about workplace safety and health management practices. The survey will be sent to private sector employers of all sizes and across all industries under OSHA's jurisdiction. Questions include whether respondents already have a safety management system, whether they perform annual inspections, who manages safety at their establishments and what kinds of hazards they encounter at their facilities. Participation in the survey is voluntary. The survey is accompanied by a cover letter from Assistant Secretary of Labor for OSHA Dr. David Michaels. Contact information for OSHA and its contractor, Eastern Research Group, is included for respondents who have questions about the survey. They will receive a paper copy of the survey that can be filled out and returned to ERG and the option to complete it online. Only those who receive a paper copy of the survey will be able to complete the online version. The agency expects the data collection phase to be completed by August. ERG will provide the results – which will be anonymous and cannot be used for enforcement – to OSHA. OSHA published a notice of its intent to conduct the survey in the Federal Register on Aug. 12, 2010. Following a 60-day comment period, as required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act, OSHA published a second Federal Register notice for comments on Nov. 3, 2010, and received clearance from the Office of Management and Budget to conduct the survey.

The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, Atlanta Division, alleges that the defendants violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act by taking prohibited loans from the plan and not forwarding employee contributions to the plan in a timely manner. The department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration alleges that Milton Pate Sr. took out a loan from the plan that is currently in default with a balance of $94,778. Additionally, his son, Milton Pate Jr., secured three loans from the plan, with a remaining outstanding loan balance of $38,938. Finally, EBSA found that employee contributions to the plan between January 2007 and August 2008 were not forwarded in a timely manner, resulting in lost earnings of $1,800. “Retirement assets are not a piggy bank to be raided whenever the principals of a company need extra cash. Employees contributed the assets for their future retirement needs, and the Labor Department will not allow fiduciaries to disregard their responsibilities,” said Isabel Colon, EBSA’s acting regional director in Atlanta. The department is requesting that the court order the defendants to restore all losses to the plan, including interest or lost opportunity costs, and set off the defendants’ individual plan accounts against the amount of losses. Also, the department seeks removal of the defendants from their fiduciary roles, an order barring them from serving in the future as fiduciaries over any plan subject to ERISA, and the appointment of an independent fiduciary at the defendants’ expense. The retirement plan is set up as a 401(k) profit-sharing plan that allows employees to contribute a portion of their earnings through payroll deductions. Milton Pate and Associates is an architectural design company with offices in Tucker, Ga., and Charleston, S.C. This case resulted from an investigation conducted by EBSA’s Atlanta Regional Office. The Labor Department is represented in court by the department’s Office of the Solicitor.

The lawsuit alleges that the defendants diverted employees’ contributions away from the company’s 401(k) profit-sharing plan, and failed to administer and terminate the plan after the company ceased operating. Filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina, Greensboro Division, the suit alleges that the defendants withheld employee contributions but failed to forward them to the plan, resulting in losses of $7,255 in contributions plus $1,494 in lost earnings opportunities. The defendants allowed the funds to be commingled with the general assets of Embrenche. Since the company stopped operating, the defendants have failed to administer the plan and have effectively abandoned it, resulting in plan participants being unable to gain access to their funds. “Plan participants are counting on these assets for their retirement, and the Labor Department holds fiduciaries fully accountable for the funds entrusted to their care,” said Isabel Colon, director of the Atlanta Regional Office of the department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration.

"May 23, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20110523-1,"US Labor Department sues former Fletcher, NC, technology holding company to restore losses to company’s health plan","FLETCHER, N.C. – The U.S. Department of Labor has sued former Fletcher-based Unicomp Inc. and its chief executive officer, Stephen Hafer, to restore losses suffered by participants in the company’s health plan. The Labor Department has filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, Atlanta Division, alleging that the defendants violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act when they withheld $9,688 in employee contributions to the plan between May and December 2006, even though the plan had been terminated on April 30, 2006, for nonpayment of premiums. Employee contributions were neither returned to employees nor forwarded to the insurer, but were instead used by the defendants for other purposes. The department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration has found that Unicomp also received $2,481 in Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, better known as COBRA, premiums between April and July 2006, but did not reimburse plan participants for COBRA payments after the health plan had been canceled. Nor were the payments used for plan purposes. In addition, following cancellation of the policy, participants incurred $4,127 in unpaid medical claims. The Labor Department is asking the court to require the defendants to restore all losses to the plan, including interest and lost opportunity costs. The department is also asking that any funds owed by the health plan to the defendants for any claims submitted not be paid to them but used instead to help restore losses incurred by other participants in the plan. It is also asking that the defendants be removed as fiduciaries of the plan and have a successor trustee take over its operation, distribute assets and terminate it if necessary. “Employees acted in good faith when they contributed to their health plan and were deceived into believing that they had health coverage when none existed. The Labor Department will not tolerate misuse of employees’ funds by fiduciaries who fail to act in the best interests of plan participants,” said Isabel Colon, acting director of EBSA’s Atlanta Regional Office, which conducted the investigation for this case. Unicomp was a holding company incorporated in North Carolina that filed for bankruptcy in 2006. This case is being brought before a federal court in Atlanta because that is the district in which Hafer currently resides. The Labor Department is represented in court by the department’s Office of the Solicitor.

The lawsuit alleges that the defendants diverted employees’ contributions away from the company’s 401(k) profit-sharing plan, and failed to administer and terminate the plan after the company ceased operating. Filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina, Greensboro Division, the suit alleges that the defendants withheld employee contributions but failed to forward them to the plan, resulting in losses of $7,255 in contributions plus $1,494 in lost earnings opportunities. The defendants allowed the funds to be commingled with the general assets of Embrenche. Since the company stopped operating, the defendants have failed to administer the plan and have effectively abandoned it, resulting in plan participants being unable to gain access to their funds. “Plan participants are counting on these assets for their retirement, and the Labor Department holds fiduciaries fully accountable for the funds entrusted to their care,” said Isabel Colon, director of the Atlanta Regional Office of the department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration. The suit seeks a court order to remove the defendants as plan fiduciaries, require them to restore plan losses, set off individual plan accounts against the amount of losses and bar the fiduciaries from serving in the future for any plan subject to ERISA.

Under this grant, about 1,345 workers to be dislocated between now and September 2011 will be provided with training and re-employment services over the next year. ""The Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission must make difficult choices to reorganize defense facilities. Those choices impact not only military personnel but the entire community surrounding a base,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""The Labor Department is committed to providing the funding necessary for individuals affected by base closings to update their skill sets and find new employment."" Awarded to the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development, today's increment of $1.5 million brings the total amount of funding by the Labor Department related to Fort Monmouth base realignment and closure actions to $3,803,164. In 2006 and 2007, the state was approved for a total of $803,164 to develop a strategic plan addressing both the workforce and economic issues related to the closing of Fort Monmouth. On Nov. 18, 2008, the state was approved for funding in the amount of $3 million, with $1.5 million released initially, to begin providing services to BRAC-impacted workers. The increment being announced today represents the other half of that $3 million award. National Emergency Grants are part of the secretary of labor's discretionary fund and are awarded based on a state's ability to meet specific guidelines.

Administrative Law Judge William Dorsey found Global Horizons and Orian jointly and severally liable for 11 categories of violations, warranting back wage payments, penalty assessments and a mandatory three-year debarment from participation in the H-2A program. ""It's appropriate that Global Horizons and its owner are barred from employing H-2A workers for the next three years,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""These workers left their families and homes with the expectation that they would be treated fairly and paid properly. Instead, Global Horizons violated multiple rules under the H-2A program designed to protect both domestic and foreign workers, and provide a level playing field for all agricultural employers."" Investigations conducted by local offices of the department's Wage and Hour Division's Western Region found that the defendants failed to pay employees for all hours worked and to pay the correct hourly wage rate; impermissibly withheld federal income tax and made illegal deductions from workers' wages for meals and other basic living expenses; charged workers for housing-related expenses such as water, electricity and sewage; failed to pay workers for their transportation and subsistence costs; retaliated against workers who rightfully complained about their pay; failed to maintain required payroll records and produce them upon the division's request; and illegally solicited agreements from workers to waive their rights and decrease their wages. Dorsey determined that Global Horizons and Orian engaged in a pattern of activity that caused significant injury to the H-2A workers concerning their wages, benefits and working conditions, and ordered the three-year debarment. The debarment ordered by Dorsey follows a Dec. 21, 2010, ruling by the Labor Department's Administrative Review Board affirming a $199,600 judgment against both Global Horizons and Orian in a California H-2A case. The board found that Global Horizons and Orian gave preferential treatment to H-2A workers over U.S. workers and committed many of the same violations as in the Hawaii case. The department's San Francisco Regional Solicitor's Office litigated both of these cases. For more information about enforcement under the H-2A temporary worker program, call the Wage and Hour Division's toll-free helpline at 866-4US-WAGE (487-9243).

Of that amount, $75,411,688 represents total funding for 74 programs. The remaining amount supplements awards for two programs partially funded earlier this year from fiscal year 2010 appropriations. ""Every day in America, 7,000 students drop out of high school. Our nation cannot afford to lose these young people,"" said Secretary Solis. ""YouthBuild provides an important second chance to earn an education while also developing valuable skills for the jobs of today and tomorrow."" YouthBuild is an alternative education program that offers individuals ages 16-24 training and practical experience for ""in-demand"" industry careers. Participants, who also earn high school diplomas or GED certificates through the program, have been in the juvenile justice system, are aging out of foster care, are high school dropouts, and are otherwise at-risk of failing to reach key educational milestones and opportunities that lead to career fulfillment. In addition to receiving academic and occupational skills training, participants develop leadership skills and contribute community service. The Labor Department has administered the YouthBuild program since 2006, awarding its first grants in 2007. In that time, more than 16,000 youth have been served by YouthBuild programs nationwide.

"May 16, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20110516,US Labor Departments OSHA reopens public record on proposed record-keeping rule to add work-related musculoskeletal disorders column,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration tomorrow will reopen the public record on a proposed rule to revise the Occupational Injury and Illness Recording and Reporting Requirements regulation. Notice of the reopening will be published May 17 in the Federal Register . The purpose of reopening the record is to allow interested individuals to comment on the small business teleconferences that OSHA and the Small Business Administration's Office of Advocacy co-sponsored on April 11 and 12, and on the issues raised during the teleconferences. OSHA held the teleconferences to gather information from representatives of small businesses about their experiences recording work-related musculoskeletal disorders and how they believe they would be impacted by OSHA's proposed rule. The public is invited to submit comments by June 16, 2011. On Jan. 29, 2010, OSHA proposed to revise its Occupational Injury and Illness Recording and Reporting Requirements regulation to restore a column to the OSHA 300 log that employers would have to check if an incident they already have recorded under existing rules is an MSD. The proposed rule would not change the existing record-keeping requirements about when and under what circumstances employers must record work-related injuries and illnesses. The only additional requirement the proposed rule would impose is for an employer to mark the MSD column box on the OSHA 300 log if a case it already has recorded meets the definition of an MSD. ""OSHA is eager to hear from the public on this, and every, proposed rule,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health Dr. David Michaels. ""The more feedback the agency receives from small businesses on this topic, the better informed we will be in crafting a proposed regulation that protects workers without overburdening employers."" Under the existing regulation, employers already must determine whether a case is recordable – that is, whether the case meets the definition of ""injury or illness""; is a new case; is work-related; and meets at least one of the recording criteria. Examples of recording criteria are days away from work, restricted work and medical treatment beyond first aid. The proposed rule would define an MSD, for record-keeping purposes only, as a disorder of the muscles, nerves, tendons, ligaments, joints, cartilage or spinal discs that was not caused by a slip, trip, fall, motor vehicle accident or similar accident. OSHA estimates that 1.505 million recordable MSDs are expected to occur annually among 1.542 million affected establishments and that the annualized costs of the proposed rule would be $1.7 million per year for all affected establishments combined. OSHA has posted a summary of comments about the teleconferences in the public docket for this rulemaking at http://www.regulations.gov."

The company also has been placed in OSHA's Severe Violators Enforcement Program, which focuses enforcement resources on employers that have demonstrated indifference to their Occupational Safety and Health Act obligations by committing willful, repeated or failure-to-abate violations. ""There is no excuse for Republic Engineered Products to continue to neglect its workers' safety,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for OSHA Dr. David Michaels. ""This company has a long history of OSHA violations, including employee injuries and fatalities in several of its plants. It needs to make a serious effort to comply with common-sense regulations to protect its employees."" OSHA began the inspection of the Lorain facility in November 2010 after a worker was hospitalized with a broken pelvis when he fell 9 feet from a coil transfer car in the bar mill. The willful violations carried proposed penalties of $480,500 for exposing employees to falls from the car and an unguarded platform, and for failing to affix lockout/tagout devices to control the unexpected energizing of equipment. A willful violation is one committed with intentional knowing or voluntary disregard for the law's requirements, or with plain indifference to worker safety and health. The repeat violations with proposed fines of $82,500 were cited for failing to train employees in lockout/tagout procedures; specify the procedural steps necessary to lock out electrical, hydraulic and gravitational energy sources for the coil transfer car; and isolate all hazardous energy sources. A repeat violation exists when an employer previously has been cited for the same or a similar violation of a standard, regulation, rule or order at any other facility in federal enforcement states within the last five years. The company was cited in 2008 at both the Lorain facility and its Blasdell, N.Y., facility for failing to develop and adequately train workers on lockout/tagout procedures. Failure to operate energy isolation devices properly also was cited in Blasdell in 2008. The company's Lorain location, which employs approximately 250 people, also was cited in another incident by OSHA in 2010 for 13 violations and fined $143,000. The Lorain facility has been inspected 25 times since 1990, resulting in 76 violations in addition to those currently being cited. Republic Engineered Products Inc., which is headquartered in Canton, Ohio, employs more than 2,200 workers companywide and operates additional manufacturing facilities in Canton and Massillon, Ohio, as well as in Blasdell, N.Y.; Gary, Ind.; and Hamilton, Ontario, in Canada. Excluding the Lorain location, the company's combined sites have been inspected 53 times since 1990, resulting in a total of 124 violations. For more information on the Severe Violators Enforcement Program, visit http://www.osha.gov/dep/svep-directive.pdf . The company has 15 business days from receipt of its citations and penalties to comply, request an informal conference with OSHA's area director or contest the findings before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. Employers and employees with questions regarding workplace safety and health standards can call OSHA's Toledo Area Office at 419-259-7542. To report workplace incidents, fatalities or situations posing imminent danger to workers, call the agency's toll-free hotline at 800-321-OSHA (6742). Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees.

The action resolves a lawsuit filed by the department in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania against the company and Scott Slocum, its president and co-owner. A default judgment also was entered against the company. The suit followed an investigation by the Labor Department's Employee Benefits Security Administration, which found that Slocum had caused the company to retain contributions deducted from employees' paychecks, rather than deposit them into the plan. Slocum also directed that employee contributions be remitted late and without interest, and co-mingled plan assets with those of the company. These alleged violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act occurred from June 2006 to July 2007. ""We are thrilled that the contributions these workers made to the benefit plan are being protected,"" said Mabel Capolongo, director of EBSA's Philadelphia Regional Office, which conducted the investigation. ""The Labor Department remains committed to holding irresponsible fiduciaries legally accountable when they fail to act in the best interest of plan participants.""

"May 12, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20110512,US district court upholds OSHA subpoena in grain engulfment case,"CHICAGO – A U.S. district court has upheld a subpoena issued by the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration requesting documents from Grinnell Mutual Reinsurance Co. concerning inspections and reports the company prepared for Haasbach LLC. Two teenage workers were killed in a grain engulfment at Haasbach's Mount Carroll, Ill., site in July 2010. Grinnell contended that the subpoena would discourage businesses from allowing insurers to conduct safety inspections if the material contained in the inspection reports can be used against a business during later litigation or OSHA enforcement proceedings. The court ordered that the records be given to OSHA. OSHA Assistant Secretary Dr. David Michaels praised the decision. ""The court affirmed OSHA's authority to obtain relevant information from an employer's workers' compensation insurance company. This is not surprising legally, but it does illustrate that workers' compensation and OSHA are not separate worlds divorced from each other,"" he said. ""Workers' compensation loss control activities overlap with OSHA's efforts to bring about safe and healthful workplaces, and in order to achieve a safe and healthful working environment for all Americans, all efforts of business, insurance, labor and government must move forward together."" The court ruled that OSHA has jurisdiction to investigate the workplace fatalities, and further has the authority to require the production of relevant evidence and the ability to issue a subpoena to obtain that evidence. The requested documents, which included copies of site safety inspections, applications for insurance coverage for the site, and correspondence between Grinnell and Haasbach concerning the site, were found to ""reasonably relate to the investigation of the incident and the question of OSHA jurisdiction,"" according to the decision. Haasbach was issued 25 citations by OSHA with a penalty of $555,000 following an investigation into the deaths of the two teenage workers at the company's grain elevator in Mount Carroll. A 20-year-old man also was seriously injured in the July 2010 incident when all three became entrapped in corn more than 30 feet deep. At the time of the incident, the workers were ""walking down the corn"" to make it flow while machinery used for evacuating the grain was running. OSHA's Region V, which includes Illinois, Ohio and Wisconsin, initiated a Grain Safety Local Emphasis Program in August 2010, and has since conducted 61 inspections and cited grain operators/facilities for 163 violations. The violations cover hazards associated with grain engulfment, machine guarding, electricity, falls, employee training, combustible dust and lockout/tagout of energy sources on potentially dangerous equipment. Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees.

""President Obama is committed to pursuing an ambitious trade agenda that will help grow our economy and support good jobs for American workers by opening new markets. An essential component of this agenda is ensuring that our trading partners respect fundamental labor rights so that U.S. businesses and workers compete on a level playing field,"" said Polaski. Polaski told the committee that the action plan outlines an ambitious set of specific, concrete steps to address outstanding labor issues. Under the plan, the Colombian government is expanding its protection program to prevent violence against unionists, increasing resources to prosecute the perpetrators of violence, and strengthening labor laws and enforcement to better protect workers' rights. Under the labor provisions of the U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement, both countries have committed to adopt and maintain laws and practices that protect fundamental worker rights, and to submit to legal proceedings if they fail to meet those commitments. Violations of the protections for workers' rights can result in fines and trade sanctions. Polaski urged Congress to reauthorize the 2009 Trade and Globalization Adjustment Assistance Act to help the tens of thousands of workers impacted by trade obtain job training, placement assistance and income support so they can succeed in a tough job market. The act strengthened the Trade Adjustment Assistance program for workers by extending coverage to those in the service sector and expanding workers' opportunities to receive job training and other services. Polaski also urged Congress to reauthorize the Generalized System of Preferences and the Andean Trade Preference Act — two programs that enjoy broad bipartisan support and are important, time-tested tools for promoting economic growth in the developing world.

"May 10, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20110510-0,Job Corps students in Massachusetts create stone awards honoring US Labor Department employees for actions following Upper Big Branch Mine disaster,"WASHINGTON – Unique, handcrafted awards honoring the service and dedication of U.S. Department of Labor employees following the Upper Big Branch mining disaster in West Virginia last year were created by students from the Westover Job Corps Center in Chicopee, Mass. As a tribute to the strength and sacrifice of the 29 courageous men who perished in the 2010 mining disaster, and to recognize the untiring efforts of the Labor Department's first responders and rescue teams, the students made the awards out of Goshen stone found in western Massachusetts and West Virginia, which bears a resemblance in both texture and color to coal. In a ceremony today, Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis presented the awards to 215 Labor Department employees in recognition of their exceptional efforts and outstanding displays of professionalism, teamwork and devotion during the mine rescue, recovery and communications efforts in response to the Upper Big Branch explosion. These employees were the dedicated first responders and mine rescue teams involved in search and recovery efforts, as well as others who sought justice and mine safety improvements so that an accident of that magnitude will never be repeated. The department honored employees from several of its agencies: the Mine Safety and Health Administration, the Office of Congressional and Intergovernmental Affairs, the Office of Public Affairs, the Solicitor of Labor and the Office of the Secretary. ""This award symbolizes that the Labor Department's thoughts and prayers are never far from the miners who lost their lives and the loved ones they left behind,"" Secretary Solis said. ""It is also a daily reminder that this department's employees have dedicated themselves to improving mine safety so that every miner, at every mine, after every shift, returns home to his or her family safe and whole."" Job Corps is a program of the Department of Labor's Employment and Training Administration. Westover Job Corps Center and the Upper Big Branch Award design The Employment and Training Administration's Job Corps is the nation's largest career technical training and education program for students ages 16 through 24. The program serves approximately 60,000 young people each year at 124 centers in 48 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Students from the Westover Job Corps Center's brick masonry track came together as a team to brainstorm what the award should look like, be composed of and symbolize. They chose a mica schist type of granite known as Goshen stone, which each miner would have encountered in mining for coal to provide America with energy. The students felt that the hardness of the stone symbolized the determination and resolve of Labor Department employees who worked tirelessly in search and rescue teams, and subsequent legal and regulatory mine safety efforts. Under the direction of Jason M. Laverty, an International Masonry Institute bricklaying instructor, students used hammers and chisels to cut 2-by-3-foot Goshen stone slabs down into 6-by-6-inch workable chunks. The students then shaped the stones to resemble pieces of coal, and went through eight different polishing techniques so that the stones could be affixed with a Labor Department medallion and a nameplate. No two awards are alike, and each took 2.5 hours to complete. Biographies of the Westover Job Corps Center Upper Big Branch Award team Armando Castro , 19, came from a rough neighborhood in Lynn, Mass., where getting into trouble was easy, and achieving success was difficult. Thanks to the inspirational example set by his hardworking single mother, Armando chose to enroll in Job Corps and train in bricklaying. ""I really liked the work. I liked being able to create something with my hands, by myself,"" said Armando. He is honored to be a member of the talented student team selected to create the award. Erick Garica , 23, of Holyoke, Mass., came to the Westover Job Corps Center seeking a high school diploma and the skills necessary to compete in today's job market. His bricklaying training has opened up his artistic side and allowed him to focus on a potential career because, as he said, ""This vocation lets you play and explore as you work."" Being among the students who designed the Upper Big Branch Award is special to him. Justin Bracewell , 17, of Worchester, Mass., is the youngest member of the Upper Big Branch Award team. Justin already knows that once he completes his bricklaying studies, he plans to join a union and make his living in the construction field. Being part of the winning submission was an honor, he said. Jonathan Oliver , 20, of New Haven, Conn., said that he wants to be a success some day to make his adoptive mother proud. Although his training at the Westover Job Corps Center is in brick masonry, he hopes to go to college and maybe even become an actor. Being part of the winning submission that both honored the fallen miners and paid tribute to dedicated government workers helped open his eyes to the value of hard work because, he said, ""Nothing is promised. Each day is a gift."" Daryl Lidwin , 18, of Ludlow, Mass., knew even in high school that he wanted to become a certified bricklayer. ""I am learning about a skill that I love, working with staff and students that care about the trade, and I feel good about who I am,"" at Westover, he said. Daryl said that the Upper Big Branch Award represents coal, the complexity of mining, and an appreciation for those who work in the field and those in government who sought to make it a safer occupation. Eric Cruz, 21, of Boston, Mass., chose Job Corps and brick masonry training because, ""In bricklaying, you have to think about what the design is going to look like before you complete it... You are always using your mind."" The design his team submitted, he said, was meant to honor strong people and their land. See a Photo of the Award"
"May 10, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20110510,"Gulf Coast art created by Job Corps student in Guthrie, Okla., used in award honoring US Labor Department employees for service during BP oil spill","WASHINGTON Malcolm-Jamal Warren, a student at the Guthrie Job Corps Center in Guthrie, Okla., created a unique picture that depicts the beauty of the Gulf Coast, which has been used as part of an award honoring the service and dedication of U.S. Department of Labor employees during the aftermath of the 2010 BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill disaster. Warren applied a variety of oil pastels and colored pencils on heavyweight construction paper to create a scene that captures the beauty and timelessness of the beaches and wild life along the Gulf Coast prior to the oil spill as well as Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Warren said that his artwork was designed to honor the memory of workers who perished, the resolve of Gulf Coast inhabitants and the untiring efforts of many Labor Department employees in relation to the spill. In a ceremony today, Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis presented replicas of the painting in a shadow box frame to 312 Labor Department employees in recognition of their outstanding efforts and service. When the oil spill happened, these employees protected cleanup workers; monitored the region's cleanup operations; helped citizens seeking reimbursement from BP; provided skills assessment and training, and individual career counseling; and enforced wage laws and contract compliance. ""Eleven oil rig workers needlessly lost their lives, and working families in the Gulf Coast were dealt a tremendous blow by the oil spill, while still recovering from Katrina and Rita,"" Secretary Solis said. ""This beautiful art, which depicts the timeless beauty of the region, is a daily reminder that the Labor Department will do whatever is necessary to help the Gulf Coast and its people recover and become whole again."" The honored employees represent multiple agencies of the Labor Department: the Employment and Training Administration, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Office of Congressional and Intergovernmental Affairs, the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, the Office of Public Affairs, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Policy, the Office of the Secretary, the Solicitor's Office, and the Wage and Hour Division. Twenty-year-old Warren has a special place in his heart for the Gulf Coast. A New Orleans native who also has lived in Florida, Warren felt the devastating impact of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita on the people and land of Louisiana and surrounding areas, and recognized the efforts of government agencies to help in the recovery. Then the BP oil spill ""destroyed not only the lives of some of the people on the Gulf Coast, but also the lives of our precious wildlife and its habitat,"" he said. Warren used his art skills honed at the Guthrie Job Corps Center to create his picture, which, he said, ""reminded me of the Louisiana skies, our lakes, rivers and wildlife."" Warren designed his scene using 11 different colors. He creatively blended two shades of yellow art pencil and oil pastel, four shades of blue oil pastels, one orange oil pastel, one black pencil, one blue-green oil pastel, and one white pencil to compose and capture the colors of the environment. Job Corps is a program of the Department of Labor's Employment and Training Administration. Job Corps is the nation's largest career technical training and education program for students ages 16 through 24. The program serves approximately 60,000 young people each year at 124 centers in 48 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. See a Photo of the Award"

"May 9, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20110509,Keeping track of wages:  The US Labor Department has an app for that!,"New timesheet app to help ensure workers receive all wages earned WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Labor today announced the launch of its first application for smartphones, a timesheet to help employees independently track the hours they work and determine the wages they are owed. Available in English and Spanish, users conveniently can track regular work hours, break time and any overtime hours for one or more employers. Glossary, contact information and materials about wage laws are easily accessible through links to the Web pages of the department's Wage and Hour Division. Additionally, through the app, users will be able to add comments on any information related to their work hours; view a summary of work hours in a daily, weekly and monthly format; and email the summary of work hours and gross pay as an attachment. This new technology is significant because, instead of relying on their employers' records, workers now can keep their own records. This information could prove invaluable during a Wage and Hour Division investigation when an employer has failed to maintain accurate employment records. ""I am pleased that my department is able to leverage increasingly popular and available technology to ensure that workers receive the wages to which they are entitled,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""This app will help empower workers to understand and stand up for their rights when employers have denied their hard-earned pay."" The free app is currently compatible with the iPhone and iPod Touch. The Labor Department will explore updates that could enable similar versions for other smartphone platforms, such as Android and BlackBerry, and other pay features not currently provided for, such as tips, commissions, bonuses, deductions, holiday pay, pay for weekends, shift differentials and pay for regular days of rest. For workers without a smartphone, the Wage and Hour Division has a printable work hours calendar in English and Spanish to track rate of pay, work start and stop times, and arrival and departure times. The calendar also includes easy-to-understand information about workers' rights and how to file a wage violation complaint. Both the app and the calendar can be downloaded from the Wage and Hour Division's home Web page at http://www.dol.gov/whd . For more information about federal wage laws or to order a calendar by mail, call the division's toll-free helpline at 866-4US-WAGE (487-9243). Read this news release en Espaol ."

"May 6, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20110506,Statement of Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis on April employment numbers,"WASHINGTON – Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis issued the following statement on the April 2011 Employment Situation report released today: ""Our nation's labor market registered encouraging job growth in the month of April. Nonfarm payroll employment added 244,000 jobs, exceeding expectations, with the private sector adding 268,000 jobs. The unemployment rate edged up to 9.0 percent. ""April's broad-based job gains were the largest we have seen in 11 months. Our economy has now seen private sector job gains for 14 months running. During this period, we have added 2.1 million private sector jobs, including 760,000 in the last three months alone. We have crossed an important threshold by creating more than enough jobs in each of the last three months to outpace growth in the labor force and put unemployed Americans back to work. ""While we saw the unemployment rate tick up in April to 9.0 percent from 8.8 percent, we should remember that unemployment had fallen a full percentage point over the previous four months. Job growth over the last three months indicates that our recovery has picked up the pace, although we clearly have more work to do. We will not be satisfied until every American who wants to work can find a job. ""One number that concerns me is the 25 percent unemployment rate among teenagers. That figure points to a continued need for business leaders to reaffirm their commitment to our economic success of tomorrow by investing in young workers today. To that end, my department has launched a summer jobs initiative, forging partnerships among government, employers and local communities to ensure our young workers share in our economic recovery. More information is available online at http://www.dol.gov/summerjobs/ . ""Going forward, we also need to make sure our government is living within its means, while still investing in our future, strengthening the middle class and growing the economy. If we want businesses to locate in America and create jobs, we have to make sure America is built to compete. We need to have the best roads, the quickest trains, the fastest broadband networks and the best trained workers. Making the investments we need is more difficult due to the size of the deficit this administration inherited. But President Obama and I are committed to protecting the investments that will create new industries and new jobs, and lead to a full recovery."""

"May 5, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20110505-0,"US Labor Department announces continuation grants for 9 persistently dangerous high schools in Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York State","Students to benefit from mentoring, employment support, violence prevention activities WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor has announced a continuation of grants amounting to more than $17.3 million for a third round of funding to nine schools in three public school districts that have been identified by their state educational agencies as ""persistently dangerous"" due to high levels of disruption and violence. Baltimore, Md.; New York State's Berkshire Union Free School; and Philadelphia, Pa., initially were granted funds in 2007. With a second round of funding awarded in 2009, selected schools continue to make progress through steady improvements in ninth grade attendance levels, ninth to tenth grade promotion rates and reduced suspension rates. ""I am proud to announce continued support that not only will help create safer school environments for students, but also increase their educational opportunities and give them a better chance to do well in their future workplaces,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""These grants represent an investment in young people who matter. Their success will be our nation's success."" This funding will enable recipient schools to continue a focus on strategies that foster enhanced educational and career opportunities. Those strategies include mentoring, employment support and violence prevention. Activities supported through these grants include anti-bullying efforts, peer mediation, anger management classes, crisis intervention, increased involvement of parents and teacher training. The projects funded ultimately are expected to create reforms that will have a positive impact on the entire school-based community and help reduce low student achievement, violence and high dropout rates, and improve student behavior and academic performance. Target groups include at-risk youth, such as entering ninth graders and repeating ninth graders; and those individuals who present the greatest challenges in terms of misconduct, truancy and poor school performance. The specific high schools receiving a continuation of their grants are: W.E.B. DuBois High School, The Baltimore City School District, Baltimore Md. Berkshire Farm Center, The Berkshire Union Free School District, Canaan, N.Y. Abraham Lincoln High School, Germantown High School, John Bartram High School, Overbrook High School, Thomas FitzSimons High School, University City High School and West Philadelphia High School, all in The School District of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pa.

An initial award of $297,000 was approved on March 4, 2010, to serve about 280 workers. ""Helping these individuals maintain insurance coverage as they seek re-employment is one way we can ensure Georgia's working families get the support they need and deserve,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""Searching for a new job can be challenging enough without the added concern of how to pay for health insurance, especially if the job seeker or a family member falls ill or needs medical attention."" Awarded to the Georgia Department of Labor, the grant will be used to make health insurance payments for unemployed individuals who are receiving Trade Adjustment Assistance benefits and are eligible for the Health Coverage Tax Credit. The TAA Health Coverage Improvement Act of 2009, which authorized eligible recipients to receive payments at 80 percent of the cost of qualified health insurance premiums, expired on February 13. Therefore, all the proposed participants under this supplemental funding will receive payments at the 65 percent level. The funds announced today will be used to make ""gap filler"" payments for up to three months, the amount of time it takes to complete Internal Revenue Service enrollment, processing and first payments under the HCTC.

Proposed penalties total $487,700. Cleveland, Ohio-based Parker Hannifin has 170 facilities throughout the U.S. and manufactures machinery for hydraulics, air conditioning, refrigeration and aerospace systems. OSHA issued 16 repeat citations with $407,000 in fines. Fifteen are safety-related and cover such violations as allowing the air pressure to exceed more than 30 pounds per square inch for cleaning equipment, failing to conduct periodic inspections of the lockout/tagout process in place to prevent accidental energy start-up, failing to train workers on lockout/tagout procedures, failing to unblock exit doors and routes, failing to provide machine guarding and failing to correct electrical deficiencies. One health-related violation was cited for failing to attach hazardous warning labels to five dipping tanks that contained hazardous substances such as potassium hydroxide and isoparaffinic hydrocarbon. A repeat violation exists when an employer previously has been cited for the same or a similar violation of a standard, regulation, rule or order at any other facility in federal enforcement states within the last five years. The repeat violations are based on previous inspections conducted at other company locations, including a facility in Olive Branch. OSHA issued 17 serious citations with $80,700 in fines. Fifteen are safety-related and include such violations as exposing employees to struck-by hazards due to a defective safety latch on a hoist and damaged hooks on an overhead crane; allowing unapproved electrical equipment to be used in a hazardous location where flammable chemicals were present; failing to remove and replace spiral stairs with a conventional stairways; failing to post signage indicating the direction of travel to the nearest exit; failing to provide a danger permit-required confined space sign; failing to mark a web sling with the rated load capacity; and failing to require workers to wear goggles or suitable eye protection while welding. Two health-related citations cover failing to establish an effective hearing program and to provide personal protective equipment. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known. ""Companies that cut corners at the expense of worker safety must be held accountable,"" said OSHA Assistant Secretary Dr. David Michaels. ""In this case, Parker Hannifin not only failed to make safety its top priority, but the company ignored many violations that OSHA previously had brought to its attention."" Parker Hannifin has 15 business days from receipt of the citations and proposed penalties to comply, request a conference with OSHA's area director or contest the findings before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.

The subcontractors joining Stanley Associates Inc. as parties to this settlement include Choctaw Archiving, Federal Working Group Inc., Northrop Grumman Technical Services Inc., P/Strada LLC, SPS Consulting LLC, TAD PGS Inc., TDB Communications Inc. and Westaff. The companies employed workers under a contract for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Vermont Service Center. Stanley Associates and its subcontractors employed workers at the Vermont Service Center under a service contract subject to the McNamara-O'Hara Service Contract Act's prevailing wage provisions, as well as the overtime requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act. An investigation by the department's Wage and Hour Division found that the employers had improperly classified several hundred of their employees, as the actual duties and nature of work being performed did not match the proper SCA classifications listed in the contract's wage determination. As a result, these workers were paid less than the prevailing wage rates guaranteed them under the terms of the federally-funded contract and many were denied proper overtime compensation in violation of the FLSA. ""The Labor Department is committed to ensuring that taxpayer dollars are being used properly and workers on publicly funded projects are paid their full wages,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""I am pleased that these workers will be appropriately compensated for the work they performed for Stanley Associates and its subcontractors. The laws governing prevailing wages on federal contracts provide important protections for workers, and the Labor Department will continue to ensure companies performing work for the federal government are held to these standards."" The employers have agreed to pay a total of $2,898,214 in back wages and have committed to ensure in the future that employees are correctly classified and compensated for all hours they work, in accordance with the SCA and the FLSA. The SCA requires contractors and subcontractors performing on federal service contracts in excess of $2,500 to pay service employees no less than the wage rates and fringe benefits found prevailing in the locality for the classification of work that they perform. The FLSA requires that covered employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour as well as time and one-half their regular hourly rates for every hour they work beyond 40 per week.

"May 2, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20110502,US Department of Labor issues final rule to protect shipyard workers,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor' Occupational Safety and Health Administration today announced a final rule to protect the safety and health of shipyard workers, which is published in today' edition of the Federal Register . The rule updates existing requirements to reflect advances in industry practices and technology, and provides new protections from hazards that previously were not addressed, including the control of hazardous energy. It is expected to prevent about 350 serious injuries each year. ""This final rule is the result of collaboration between OSHA and the maritime industry,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for OSHA Dr. David Michaels.""Shipyard work is dangerous, and we believe we have crafted a rule that protects workers while balancing employer concerns regarding implementation"" Fourteen workplace safety and health categories are being addressed in this final rule, which updates and clarifies provisions in the shipyard employment standards that had largely gone unchanged since OSHA adopted them in 1972. Such updates include establishing minimum lighting for certain work sites, accounting for employees at the end of job tasks or work shifts when working alone and adding uniform criteria to ensure shipyards have an adequate number of appropriately trained first-aid providers. The rule also updates sanitation requirements. In addition, OSHA added new provisions for the control of hazardous energy and motor vehicle safety. Until this final rule, the maritime industry did not have a specific standard to address the control of hazardous energy. Some employers have implemented portions of other lockout/tagout rules, such as 29 Code of Federal Regulations 1910.147, to protect their employees. Also, according to data from the Labor Department' Bureau of Labor Statistics' Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries, transportation incidents account for nearly 20 percent of all shipyard fatalities. The new rule' provisions seek to significantly reduce such incidents by requiring the use of seatbelts when operating motor vehicles in a shipyard. To educate employers and employees regarding the new rule, OSHA updated a designated Web page, http://www.osha.gov/dts/maritime/standards/general_working_conditions.html, to include answers to frequently asked questions regarding the final rule. The rule itself also is available at that page. Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees.

The Charlotte-based company and its president allegedly violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The settlement agreement follows investigations by the Labor Department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration into alleged violations of ERISA by Siskey and his company in their capacity as fiduciaries of profit sharing plans sponsored by Diversified Printing Techniques and J & T Utility Construction Inc., formerly known as Floyd King & Sons Inc. Under the agreement, Siskey and his company will restore $152,612.44 to the J & T Utility Construction Inc. Profit Sharing Plan and $90,363.34 to the Diversified Printing Techniques Inc. Profit Sharing Plan. Payments owed to each plan by Siskey and his company may be reduced if other fiduciaries to the plans knowingly and voluntarily waive their rights to receive a portion of the payments. Individuals named as fiduciaries for J & T Utility Construction include Jerry King and Terry King. The individual named as fiduciary for Diversified Printing Techniques is Tony Chaney Sr . EBSA alleges that Siskey and Wall Street Capitol breached their fiduciary responsibilities when the plans issued loans to The Premier Fund, wholly owned and operated by Richard Siskey. EBSA contends the loans were high-risk promissory notes, and because the profit sharing plans were not considered accredited investors as defined by Premier’s Private Placement Memorandum, the plans were not qualified to issue the loans. The loans resulted in losses to the plans due to reductions in interest rates paid and improper calculation of interest. The plans also invested in Sharon Road Properties LLC, which EBSA alleges was a prohibited transaction. EBSA further alleges that the subsequent liquidation of the investment at a value determined without the use of an independent appraiser was imprudent. If Siskey or his company violates the agreement, the Labor Department reserves the right to initiate legal action. In separate consent judgments and orders filed with the U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina – Charlotte Division – Terry King, Jerry King, Richard German and J & T Utility Construction Inc. have agreed to restore losses to the J & T Utility Construction Inc. Profit Sharing Plan, if the losses are not otherwise restored by Wall Street Capitol and Richard Siskey. Tony Chaney Sr. and Diversified Printing Techniques Inc. have agreed to a similar consent judgment covering losses incurred by Diversified Printing Techniques Inc. Profit Sharing Plan, if the losses are not otherwise restored by Wall Street Capitol and Richard Siskey. Included in the consent judgments, defendants at both companies agree to be permanently barred from acting as fiduciaries to any employee benefit plan covered by ERISA. The consent judgments follow EBSA allegations that the defendants failed to discharge their duties solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of their plans. “Employees in retirement plans expect a plan’s fiduciaries to safeguard their assets, and when this trust is violated, the fiduciaries must be held accountable for their actions,” said Isabel Colon, acting regional director for EBSA in Atlanta, Ga. The settlement agreement and consent judgments were negotiated with the assistance of the department’s Office of the Solicitor.

The purpose of these grants is to provide an employment-centered approach to reintegration that improves long-term labor market prospects for former offenders. ""To successfully reintegrate into communities and find stable employment, former offenders need jobs skills and moral support,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""This continued funding aims to connect these individuals with organizations that can provide invaluable guidance as they transition into the labor force."" Grants were initially awarded in 2009 through a competitive process open to nonprofit, faith-based and community organizations, which develop the necessary relationships and facilitate connections to rehabilitation services for program participants. Authorized by the Workforce Investment Act, these grants will provide a third year of funding to the existing grantees. Program participants are individuals ages 18 and older who have been convicted as adults under federal or state law, but who have never been convicted of a sex-related offense, with the exception of prostitution. Each year, approximately 650,000 inmates are released from state and federal prisons and return to their communities and families. Without assistance to make a successful transition, the majority of former offenders return to criminal activity. The trend has been that almost three out of five of these individuals will be charged with new crimes within three years of their release from prison, and two out of five will be re-incarcerated, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.

"April 28, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20110428,US Labor Department announces protocols for certifying U visa applications,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Labor today announced protocols to complete the portion of the U visa nonimmigrant status application requiring certification by a law enforcement agency that the applicant is a victim of a qualifying crime and willing to cooperate with law enforcement in the investigation and prosecution of that crime. U visas, as they are known, are designed to help victims of qualifying criminal activities who have suffered substantial physical or mental abuse. Individuals who receive U visas may remain in the United States for up to four years and may eventually apply for permanent residency. U visas are issued by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. ""I am pleased that the department's Wage and Hour Division has developed protocols and can begin completing U visa certifications for immigrants who are victims of crimes and willing to cooperate with law enforcement,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""Because many wage and hour investigations take place in industries using vulnerable workers in abusive situations, the Wage and Hour Division is often the first federal agency to make contact with these workers and detect criminal activity in the workplace, which it may then refer to the appropriate authorities."" The U visa certification process has been delegated to the Wage and Hour Division's regional administrators located in five cities around the country. The division will refer the underlying qualifying criminal activity to appropriate law enforcement agencies in accordance with its normal referral procedure. After the division completes a certification, the victim of the qualifying criminal activity must still submit his or her application to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services for a determination of whether to approve the application. The Wage and Hour Division will consider completing U visa certifications based on five qualifying criminal activities — involuntary servitude, peonage, trafficking, obstruction of justice and witness tampering — when it detects them in the process of investigating a violation of an employment law under its jurisdiction, for example, as related to minimum wage and overtime rights. The Wage and Hour Division is responsible for enforcing federal labor laws pertaining to the minimum wage, overtime pay, recordkeeping, child labor and special employment, family and medical leave, migrant workers, lie detector tests, worker protections in certain temporary worker programs, and the prevailing wages for government service and construction contracts. For general information about federal wage laws, call the division's toll-free helpline at 866-4US-WAGE (487-9243). Information is also available on the Internet at http://www.dol.gov/whd .

""I am expressing my personal commitment to ensure that the U.S. Department of Labor is a model workplace, free from unlawful discrimination and harassment, which fosters a work environment that fully utilizes the capabilities of every employee,"" said Secretary Solis. ""It is my goal that we achieve and maintain a high-quality, diverse workforce at all organizational levels throughout the department."" The Labor Department is required to issue annual written policy statements expressing the secretary's commitment to equal employment opportunity and a workplace free of discriminatory harassment, pursuant to 29 Code of Federal Regulations Part 1614, Federal Sector Equal Employment Opportunity, and the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's Management Directive 715. The EEOC's directive identifies minimum requirements for the policy statements. The statements issued by Secretary Solis articulate stronger protections and establish responsibilities to ensure meaningful adherence to equal employment opportunity throughout the department. They have been disseminated to all current employees and will be disseminated to new employees during orientation as well as to employees who are promoted into supervisory ranks.

"April 28, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/odep/odep20110428,US Labor Departments Office of Disability Employment Policy announces 2011 theme for National Disability Employment Awareness Month,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Labor's Office of Disability Employment Policy today announced the official theme for October's National Disability Employment Awareness Month: ""Profit by Investing in Workers with Disabilities."" The theme honors the contributions of workers with disabilities and serves to inform the public that they represent a highly skilled talent pool that can help employers compete in today's global economy. ""Return on investment means hiring the right talent,"" said Kathy Martinez, assistant secretary of labor for disability employment policy. ""Workers with disabilities represent all skill sets and are ready to get the job done. This year's theme focuses on improving employment opportunities that lead to good jobs and a secure economic future for people with disabilities and the nation as a whole."" Early announcement of the theme helps communities nationwide plan a series of announcements, events and meetings to begin in October, some of which will continue throughout the year. Such activities include proclamations, public awareness programs and job fairs that showcase the assets of workers with disabilities. As background, Public Law 176, enacted by Congress in 1945, designated the first week in October each year as ""National Employ the Physically Handicapped Week."" President Harry S. Truman designated the President's Committee on Employment of People with Disabilities to carry out the observance. In 1962, the word ""physically"" was removed from the week's name to acknowledge the employment needs of all Americans with disabilities. In 1988, Congress expanded the week to a month and changed its name to ""National Disability Awareness Month,"" which eventually evolved to its current name. The Labor Department's Office of Disability Employment Policy took over responsibility for National Disability Employment Awareness Month in 2001. Members of the public with questions related to the 2011 theme should contact Carol Dunlap in ODEP at 202-693-7902. Members of the media should contact the individuals named above. ODEP's mission is to provide national leadership by developing and influencing disability-related policies and practices to increase and enhance the employment of people with disabilities."

"April 27, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20110427,US Labor Department secures court ruling requiring Texas-based Henrys Turkey Service to pay $1.76 million to workers at Iowa processing plant,"DES MOINES, Iowa — The U.S. Department of Labor has obtained a partial summary judgment requiring Hill Country Farms, doing business as Henry's Turkey Service, and president Kenneth Henry to pay more than $1.76 million in back wages and liquidated damages for violating the minimum wage and overtime provisions of the federal Fair Labor Standards Act. The judgment partially resolves a lawsuit filed by the Labor Department following an investigation by the Des Moines District Office of its Wage and Hour Division. The judgment, issued by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa in Davenport, concluded that the defendants willfully violated the FLSA by failing to properly pay 31 workers with disabilities. Henry's Turkey Service supplied the workers to the West Liberty Foods turkey processing plant in West Liberty, where most worked on the plant's processing line. ""Working on a poultry processing line is a particularly difficult and dangerous job,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""Henry's Turkey Service exploited vulnerable employees who have a right to, and deserve, every penny that they earned."" Henry's Turkey Service, based in Goldthwaite, Texas, paid the workers $65 a month in cash wages even when company time sheets reflected that they worked more than 40 hours a week. Besides employing the workers, the company provided in-kind care, room and board, serving as the workers' caretaker as well as the designated representative payee of their Social Security benefits. Henry's Turkey Service claimed credit for the food, housing and care against its wage obligation; however, the company also reimbursed itself for those expenses using the workers' Social Security benefits. The court found that the company failed to show that it incurred any costs above the amount received from the Social Security benefits and denied the credit toward the workers' wages. The judgment requires that the defendants pay $880,777 in back wages, along with an equal amount in liquidated damages, for a total of $1,761,554. This case was litigated by the Labor Department's regional solicitor in Kansas City, Mo. Previously, the Wage and Hour Division investigated Henry's Turkey Service in 1997 and 2003, and in each case found that it failed to pay workers overtime for hours in excess of 40 per week. Following both investigations, the company paid the workers back wages owed and agreed to comply with the FLSA in the future. The FLSA currently requires that covered employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour as well as time and one-half their regular rates of pay for every hour they work beyond 40 per week. The law also requires employers to maintain accurate records of employees' wages, hours and other conditions of employment.

Solis today will announce, from Anaheim, Calif., a national outreach initiative by the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration to educate workers and their employers about the hazards of working outdoors in the heat and steps needed to prevent heat-related illnesses. ""If you're working outdoors, you're at risk for heat-related illnesses that can cause serious medical problems and even death,"" said Secretary Solis. ""But heat illness can be prevented. This Labor Department campaign will reach across the country with a very simple message – water, rest and shade."" Each year, thousands of outdoor workers experience heat illness, which often manifests as heat exhaustion. If not quickly addressed, heat exhaustion can become heat stroke, which killed more than 30 workers last year. ""As we move into the summer months, it is very important for workers and employers to take the steps necessary to stay safe in extreme heat,"" said OSHA Assistant Secretary Dr. David Michaels. ""Drinking water often, taking breaks and limiting time in the heat are simple, effective ways to prevent heat illness."" Heat can be a real danger for workers in jobs ranging from agriculture and landscaping to construction, road repair, airport baggage handling and even car sales. OSHA has developed heat illness educational materials in English and Spanish, as well as a curriculum to be used for workplace training. Additionally, a new Web page provides information and resources on heat illness – including how to prevent it and what to do in case of an emergency – for workers and employers. The page is available at http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/heatillness/ . Federal OSHA has worked closely with the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration to adapt materials from that state's successful outreach campaign on heat illness for use in this national effort. In addition, OSHA is now partnering with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on weather service alerts that will incorporate worker safety precautions when heat alerts are issued across the U.S. NOAA also will include pertinent worker safety information on its Heat Watch Web page at http://www.noaawatch.gov/themes/heat.php . OSHA will leverage relationships with other state and local partners, employers, trade organizations, unions, community groups, educational institutions and health care professionals to disseminate training materials, and educate workers and employers, on the hazards of working in the heat and how to prevent heat-related illnesses.

Veterans protected by VEVRAA include those with disabilities and those recently discharged as well as those who served during a war, campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge is authorized. The proposed rule will be published in the April 26 edition of the Federal Register . ""At the Labor Department, we support veterans as they seek meaningful ways to apply their talents to expand the American economy. By re-examining our affirmative action requirements, we will ensure that our nation's veterans are protected against discrimination and provided equal opportunity in the workforce,"" said OFCCP Director Patricia A. Shiu. The award of a federal contract comes with a number of responsibilities. Among them are complying with non-discrimination and affirmative action provisions, engaging in meaningful and effective efforts to recruit and employ veterans protected under VEVRAA, and maintaining accurate records on affirmative action efforts. Failure to abide by these responsibilities may result in various sanctions, from withholding progress payments to termination of existing contracts and debarment from receiving future ones. The framework articulating a contractor's responsibilities with respect to affirmative action, recruitment and placement has remained unchanged since 1976. Increasing numbers of veterans are returning from tours of duty, and many are faced with substantial obstacles in finding employment upon leaving the service. The proposed rule clarifies mandatory job listing requirements, under which a contractor must provide job vacancy and contact information for each of its locations to an appropriate employment service delivery system. The rule proposes requiring contractors to engage in at least three specified types of outreach and recruitment efforts each year. In addition, the proposed rule would require that all applicants be invited to self-identify as a ""protected veteran"" before they are offered a job. Increasing data collection on job referrals, applicants and hires, and requiring contractors to establish hiring benchmarks to assist in measuring the effectiveness of their affirmative action efforts also are proposed. Comments on the notice of proposed rulemaking must be submitted by June 27. Visit the federal e-rulemaking portal, http://www.regulations.gov , to submit comments. In addition to VEVRAA, OFCCP's legal authority exists under Executive Order 11246 and Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. As amended, these three laws hold those who do business with the federal government, both contractors and subcontractors, to the fair and reasonable standard that they not discriminate in employment on the basis of gender, race, color, religion, national origin, disability or status as a protected veteran.

Solis today issued the following statement regarding the first anniversary of the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill: ""This time last year, our country experienced the largest oil spill in its history. The Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico not only released close to 5 million barrels of oil, it also claimed the lives of 11 workers, injured many more and had a major economic impact on the region. ""From day one, the Labor Department assisted workers who were impacted by this event. I dispatched my team to work proactively with BP and other federal agencies to ensure that the cleanup was prompt and effective, but most of all – safe. We worked alongside BP to ensure that anyone who was part of the cleanup, including new hires, received adequate training and protection. ""And while we were on-site to ensure workers were safe, our team remained on the ground to work with state officials from the affected Gulf states to provide the most up-to-date information on unemployment insurance claims, as well as critical training and information for our One-Stop Career Centers in the region on job placement and opportunities. ""While there has been much work done to clean up the Gulf, there is more to do. I, along with the president and my colleagues, am committed to ensuring that the Gulf returns stronger than ever before."""

The judgment also permanently bars Fussner from serving as a fiduciary or service provider to any employee benefit plan covered by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The judgment was entered after the company and Fussner failed to respond to a court complaint. The judgment resolves a lawsuit by the Labor Department against the company and Fussner for violating ERISA by failing to forward voluntary employee contributions to the company’s 401(k) plan between February 2007 and November 2008. This failure resulted in a loss to the plan of $37,232.40. As of Dec. 31, 2007, the plan had 15 participants and $41,048 in assets, the latest data available. “This defendant allowed voluntary employee contributions to be withheld from pay and retained in the company’s general operating fund, when they should have been deposited into the plan’s trust,” said Paul Baumann, regional director of the department’s Employee Benefit Security Administration in Cincinnati. “The Labor Department will continue to help workers obtain their rightful benefits when fiduciaries fail in their responsibilities to properly administer all aspects of benefit plans.” This case was investigated by EBSA’s Cincinnati Regional Office and was litigated by the department’s regional solicitor in Chicago.

"April 19, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20110419,US Department of Labors OSHA cites wind farm servicing company for 6 willful safety violations after worker suffers burns in wind tower,"Egregious safety violations result in proposed fines of $378,000 ODELL, Ill. – Outland Renewable Services has been issued six citations for willful safety violations after a wind farm technician suffered severe burns from an electrical arc flash on Oct. 20, 2010. The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration issued the citations following an investigation at the Iberdrola Streator Cayuga Ridge South Wind Farm near Odell. The company, a servicing and maintenance provider in the wind tower industry, faces proposed penalties of $378,000. ""Green jobs are an important part of our economy, and sectors such as wind energy are growing rapidly. That growth comes with a continued responsibility for employers to ensure that the health and safety of workers is never compromised,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""Outland's management was aware of the potentially hazardous conditions to which its workers could have been exposed and showed intentional disregard for employee safety by ignoring OSHA's requirements for isolating energy sources during servicing operations. Employers must not cut corners at the expense of their workers' safety."" Outland Renewable Services was issued the citations for exposing maintenance technicians to electrical hazards from the unexpected energization of transformers in three wind turbine towers. A willful violation is one committed with intentional knowing or voluntary disregard for the law's requirements, or with plain indifference to worker safety and health. On the day of the incident, Outland Renewable Services failed to ensure technicians working in wind farm towers affixed their own energy isolation devices – also known as personal lock and tag devices – on the tower turbine switch gear at ground level. That created the possibility for other workers to energize transformers in the turbine towers, upon which technicians were working at a distance of approximately 350 feet above ground. The injured worker suffered third degree burns to his neck, chest and arms, and second degree burns to the face as a result of an arc flash that occurred when a transformer was unexpectedly energized by another worker. The egregious violations in this case fall under the requirements of OSHA's Severe Violators Enforcement Program. Initiated in the spring of 2010, the program is intended to focus on employers that endanger workers by committing willful, repeat or failure-to-abate violations in one or more of the following circumstances: a fatality or catastrophe; industry operations or processes that expose workers to severe occupational hazards; exposure to hazards related to the potential releases of highly hazardous chemicals; and all per-instance citation (egregious) enforcement actions. For more information about the Severe Violators Enforcement Program, visit http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=DIRECTIVES&p_id=4503 . Outland Renewable Services' corporate offices are located in Canaby, Minn. This OSHA inspection was the first conducted at the Iberdrola Streator Caugya Ridge South Wind Farm. The company has 15 business days from receipt of its citations and penalties to comply, request an informal conference with OSHA's area director or contest the findings before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. Employers and employees with questions regarding workplace safety and health standards can call OSHA's Peoria office at 309-589-7033. To report workplace incidents, fatalities or situations posing imminent danger to workers, call the agency's toll-free hotline at 800-321-OSHA (6742). Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. OSHA's role is to ensure these conditions for America's working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education and assistance.

"April 14, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20110414,US Labor Department fall protection directive upheld in US Court of Appeals,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit rejected a challenge by the National Roofing Contractors Association to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's December 2010 directive on the use of fall protection in residential construction. The directive withdrew an earlier one that allowed certain residential construction employers to bypass some fall protection requirements. ""Fall protection saves lives,"" said OSHA Assistant Secretary Dr. David Michaels. ""There are effective means available to protect residential construction workers from falls. We applaud the court's decision upholding this updated, commonsense directive."" Data from the department's Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that an average of 40 workers are killed each year as a result of falls from residential roofs. One-third of those deaths represent Latino workers, who often lack sufficient access to safety information and protections. Latino workers comprise more than one-third of all construction employees. ""Fatalities from falls are the number one cause of death in construction,"" added Michaels. ""These deaths are preventable, and we must prevent them."" OSHA's new directive, Standard 03-11-002, rescinded the Interim Fall Protection Compliance Guidelines for Residential Construction, Standard 03-00-001. Prior to the issuance of this new directive, Standard 03-00-001 allowed employers engaged in certain residential construction activities to use specified alternative methods of fall protection rather than the conventional fall protection required by the residential construction fall protection standard. With the issuance of the new directive, all residential construction employers must comply with 29 Code of Federal Regulations 1926.501(b)(13). Where residential builders can demonstrate that traditional fall protection is not feasible, 29 CFR 1926.501(b)(13) still allows for alternative means of providing protection.

The case resulted from an investigation by the department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration into alleged violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. “Failing to forward voluntary employee salary contributions to employee retirement plans is a violation of trust,” said Paul Baumann, EBSA’s regional director in Cincinnati. “The Labor Department will continue to fight for workers when fiduciaries fail in their responsibilities to properly administer employee benefits.” The suit, filed in U.S. district court in Grand Rapids, Mich., alleges that the company and Reschke violated ERISA by failing to forward employee contributions to the plan from June 18, 2009, through Sept. 24, 2009. Those funds were retained in Metal Processor’s general account and used to pay the company’s operating expenses. The company filed for bankruptcy Aug. 31, 2010, at which time the plan had 34 participants and $874,191 in assets. The suit seeks a court order to restore money owed to the plan, including lost opportunity costs, and to appoint an independent fiduciary to terminate the plan and distribute its assets to the participants and beneficiaries. The suit also seeks to prevent the company and Reschke from serving as fiduciaries to any ERISA-covered employee benefit plan in the future. EBSA protects the security of the retirement, health and other workplace-related benefits of America’s workers, retirees and their families. The agency oversees approximately 708,000 private sector retirement plans, 2.8 million health plans and a similar number of other workplace-related benefit plans that provide benefits to more than 150 million Americans.

The lawsuit, filed in U.S. district court in St. Paul, alleges that Mondor failed to administer and/or terminate the company’s plan, which has prevented qualified participants from obtaining distributions of their individual account balances. The company ceased operations in 2008. At that time, the profit sharing plan had five participants and assets totaling $12,169. “Our legal action underscores the Labor Department’s commitment to hold accountable those who are entrusted with the assets of workers’ retirement plans,” said Jim Purcell, acting regional director of the department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration in Kansas City, Mo. “Retirement plans are individual assets and to prevent employees from accessing their own accounts is unjust. The Department of Labor will continue to help workers obtain their rightful benefits when plan fiduciaries fail to do so.” The suit seeks a court order for Mondor to distribute the plan’s assets to qualified participants and to terminate the plan. It also seeks to permanently bar Mondor from serving as a fiduciary or service provider to any ERISA-covered employee benefit plan in the future. EBSA protects the security of the retirement, health and other workplace-related benefits of America’s workers, retirees and their families.

The companies from which workers have been laid off represent a variety of industries, including construction, mining, auto parts, computer/IT services, trucking, manufacturing, tax services, education, health, law, banking, retail and pharmacy, among others. ""Today's grant will help the citizens of Kentucky get back on their feet and back to work,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""Whenever I meet with workers, they tell me they're not looking for a hand out. They want a hand up. That's what this grant is about – providing them with the training and re-employment services crucial for finding new jobs in growing industries."" Awarded to the commonwealth of Kentucky, this community impact grant will be operated by the Kentucky Education and Workforce Development Cabinet to provide the affected workers with a full range of re-employment and training services. Community impact grant projects are designed to assist workers in a primarily rural workforce investment area where multiple small dislocations over a six-month period have a significant impact on the local unemployment rate.

Seattle-based HWA provided security services as a contractor to various federal facilities, government offices and public works projects in the states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Missouri and New York. ""The Labor Department will not allow federal contractors to misuse public funds and exploit hardworking laborers by denying their rightful wages,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""Debarring violators such as HWA from future contracts ensures a level playing field, so that honest companies are not placed at a competitive disadvantage for playing by the rules, and paying their workers full and fair prevailing wages."" This debarment action is based on HWA's history of violations concerning the minimum wage, overtime and record-keeping provisions of the SCA and CWHSSA. Since 2001, the Labor Department's Wage and Hour Division has conducted more than 15 investigations of HWA, finding significant back wages were owed to hundreds of workers nationwide. Most recently, in 2009, the company defaulted on seven federal contracts and failed to meet its payroll obligations, resulting in nearly $1 million in unpaid wages for 206 employees. The division ordered an emergency withholding of funds on several of the company's federal contracts and secured the full payment of these wages. All SCA contracts held by the HWA were terminated shortly thereafter. SCA contract clauses require contractors and subcontractors performing services under prime contracts in excess of $2,500 to pay service employees in various classes no less than the wage rates and fringe benefits found prevailing in the locality, or the rates contained in a predecessor contractor's collective bargaining agreement, including prospective increases. The Labor Department issues SCA wage determinations for contracting agencies to incorporate into covered contracts, along with the required contract clauses. The fringe benefit requirements — usually vacation and holidays, known as ""health and welfare"" benefits — are separate and in addition to the hourly monetary wage requirement under the SCA. In addition, employers with prime contracts in excess of $100,000 under the CWHSSA must pay workers at least one and one-half times their regular rates of pay for all hours worked over 40 in a week.

Profit Sharing and 401(k) Plan of Cranston, R.I., for failure to remit employee contributions to the plan, in violation of the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Equity Concepts Inc. ceased operations in early 2008 and is the subject of a voluntary receivership in Rhode Island superior court. The retirement plan was funded solely by employee contributions. The Labor Department’s lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, alleges that Sisti failed to receive and collect employee contributions due the plan and to ensure that those contributions were forwarded to the plan account between August 2007 and February 2008. During that time, Sisti allegedly failed to forward to the plan $5,387 in employee contributions that were withheld from employee paychecks. “The withheld funds were used to benefit the company, rather than the employees, who trusted that their hard-earned retirement savings would be secure,” said Edward Maloney, acting regional director of the Labor Department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration in Boston. “The law specifically requires that plan funds be held in trust and used only for the benefit of participants and their beneficiaries.” The department seeks a court order to permanently bar Sisti from future violations of ERISA and from serving as a fiduciary or service provider to any ERISA-covered plan. The suit also seeks to require Sisti to undo any prohibited transactions and restore to the plan all losses plus interest that resulted from his fiduciary breaches. This case was investigated by EBSA’s Boston Regional Office. The court case was filed by the Labor Department’s regional solicitor in Boston.

"April 11, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20110411,"US Labor Departments OSHA issues hazard alert to hair salon owners, workers on smoothing and straightening products that could release formaldehyde","WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration is issuing a hazard alert to hair salon owners and workers about potential formaldehyde exposure from working with some hair smoothing and straightening products. The hazard alert, available on OSHA's website at http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/formaldehyde/hazard_alert.html , provides information about OSHA's investigations, the health hazards of formaldehyde and how to protect people who are working with hair smoothing and straightening products. Responding to complaints and referrals about possible exposure to formaldehyde, federal OSHA and many state occupational safety and health agencies are conducting investigations. Oregon's Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Connecticut's Department of Public Health, and agencies in several other states already have issued warnings. Federal OSHA has found formaldehyde in the air when stylists used hair smoothing products, some of which do not have formaldehyde listed on their labels or in material safety data sheets as required by law. During one investigation, the agency's air tests showed formaldehyde at levels greater that OSHA's limits for a salon, even though the product tested was labeled as formaldehyde-free. California's Occupational Safety and Health Administration recently issued violations to an importer and distributer of smoothing products labeled formaldehyde-free for failing to list formaldehyde as a hazardous ingredient on the company's product labels and in the material safety data sheets. Formaldehyde presents a health hazard if workers are exposed. It can irritate the eyes and nose; cause allergic reactions of the skin, eyes and lungs; and is linked to nose and lung cancer. OSHA requires manufacturers, importers and distributors of products that contain formaldehyde as a gas or in solution, or that can release formaldehyde during use, to include information about formaldehyde and its hazards on product labels and in the material safety data sheets that are sent to employers. ""Workers have the right to know the risks associated with the chemicals with which they work, and how to protect themselves,"" said federal OSHA Assistant Secretary Dr. David Michaels. ""Employers need to know these risks in order to ensure the safety and health of their employees."" To eliminate potential worker exposure, OSHA recommends that salon owners use products that do not contain formaldehyde, methylene glycol, formalin, methylene oxide, paraform, formic aldehyde, methanal, oxomethane, oxymethylene or Chemical Abstract Service Number 50-00-0. If a salon owner decides to continue using a formaldehyde-containing hair smoothing product, then he or she must follow OSHA's formaldehyde standard. Important requirements of this standard include conducting air monitoring, installing ventilation where needed and training workers about formaldehyde, as well as providing protective equipment such as gloves, chemical splash goggles, face shields and chemical resistant aprons. The material safety data sheet includes important information about what a product contains and how the ingredients can affect a worker's health. Salon owners and other employers must have a material safety data sheet for any of the products they use that contain hazardous chemicals. They must also make the sheet available to stylists and other workers. OSHA currently has a number of ongoing investigations at salons and of importers/distributors/manufacturers relating to hair smoothing and straightening products. Some citations have been issued. Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. OSHA's role is to ensure these conditions for America's working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education and assistance.

""Almost 50 years after enactment of the Equal Pay Act, equal pay for equal work remains elusive for millions of working women. In fact, over the past 10 years, the pay gap has remained virtually unchanged. Today in America, women are paid an average of 80 cents for every dollar paid to men. The pay gap is even larger for women of color, with black women earning about 70 cents, and Latinas about 60 cents, of every dollar paid to all men. ""When women start at a disadvantage, they stay at a disadvantage. Every time a woman starts a new job or tries to negotiate for a pay raise, she is starting from a lower base salary. So, the pay gap grows wider and wider over time. According to the Labor Department's chief economist, the pay gap for the average, full-time working woman means she gets $150 less in her weekly paycheck. If she works all year, that's $8,000 less at the end of the year and approximately $380,000 over a lifetime. That is the real cost of the pay gap. ""In his 2010 State of the Union address, President Obama said he wanted to crack down on equal pay violations. As a result, he established the National Equal Pay Enforcement Task Force that comprised four federal agencies, including the Labor Department. Working together, we have identified persistent challenges to equal pay enforcement and are taking action to address each of them. ""At the Labor Department, we are increasing our enforcement against employers who discriminate, leveling the playing field for those who do not, strengthening our regulatory authorities and creating opportunities for workplace flexibility so that women can make reasonable choices to care for their families without being penalized. The department's Women's Bureau is developing educational materials, including information to help employers identify potential wage discrimination and resources to assist employers in complying with the law. Our Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs will issue new guidance to collect better data on how workers are paid as part of our efforts to root out discrimination among federal contractors. ""Equal pay is not just a women's issue. It's not just a family issue. It's a recovery issue. I am committed to finding commonsense solutions to closing the pay gap once and for all so that our nation will be a more fair and equitable place for everyone."

""Wisconsin's manufacturing sector has been hit hard by layoffs, and many workers have lost jobs through no fault of their own,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""The Labor Department is committed to getting all Americans back to work, and this grant will provide workers with continued access to career search services and training programs that can lead to good jobs in growing industries."" The funds were awarded to the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development and will provide these workers, many of whom also are eligible for Trade Adjustment Assistance, with continued access to supportive services that are not available through the TAA program. The workers who are not TAA-eligible will have access to the full array of training and employment-related services under this grant. Of a $13,614,919 award announced in March 2010, $5,072,148 was released initially. This increment brings the total award for this project to $9,044,677. Additional funding up to the amount approved will be made available as the state demonstrates a continued need for assistance. National Emergency Grants are part of the secretary of labor's discretionary fund and are awarded based on a state's ability to meet specific guidelines.

An investigation by the Labor Department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration found that between 2005 and 2010 the defendants allegedly withheld $15,562.50 in employee contributions but never forwarded them to the plan. Funds were commingled with the general assets of the company. The defendants allegedly failed to forward an additional $163,295.90 in employee contributions to the plan in a timely manner, thus causing employees to lose earnings and opportunity costs on those funds. “Employees make contributions to their 401(k) plan with the intention of using those funds for their retirement, not to be used as an involuntary interest-free loan to the company,” said Isabel Colon, EBSA acting regional director in Atlanta. Filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia by the Labor Department’s Office of the Solicitor, the lawsuit asks the court to order the defendants to restore all losses including lost interest and opportunity costs and require that any claims of the defendants on plan assets be offset against the losses owed to the plan. The suit seeks to permanently bar the defendants from serving in a fiduciary capacity to any employee benefit plan subject to ERISA and that an independent fiduciary be appointed to oversee the plan. CSG Group provides accounting and business software services to companies with headquarters in Duluth, Ga. As of June 2010, the 401(k) plan had 15 participants and assets of approximately $389,673.54. This case is part of EBSA’s employee contribution initiative to safeguard workers’ contributions to 401(k) and health benefit plans and was investigated by EBSA’s Atlanta Regional Office.

"April 6, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20110406,"US Labor Department secures judgment with contempt finding  against Long Island catering hall, restaurant and officers","Company also facing fines for repeated and willful violations of Fair Labor Standards Act CINCINNATI  The U.S. Department of Labor has filed a petition in U.S. district court in Cincinnati seeking to recover from Hamilton Avenue Animal Hospital $85,253 in back wages and damages for 21 workers at its two locations, Hamilton Avenue Animal Hospital in Pleasant Run and Sycamore Animal Hospital in Symmes Township. An investigation by the department's Wage and Hour Division determined that the company and its owners, Michael Cable and Stephanie Cable, violated the Fair Labor Standards Act by requiring some animal handlers to pay earned overtime premium wages back to them. The petition also seeks to hold the defendants in contempt for violating an injunction entered in a 2007 court order. The latest investigation found that the employers falsified payroll records for workers at both locations by showing the overtime compensation as having been paid. The employer would pay workers the full amount due, including overtime compensation, then require the workers to give back the overtime portion in cash. The animal handlers, who worked 60-70 hours per week, were referred to the Wage and Hour Division by advocacy groups Cincinnati Interfaith Workers Center and Su Casa Hispanic Ministry. Investigators determined that $42,628.58 in overtime compensation is due to the 21 workers for the period of Jan. 1, 2008, through Dec. 31, 2010. An equal amount equivalent to statutory liquidated damages is also being sought. In addition, the Labor Department has assessed $23,100 in civil money penalties for these willful violations of the FLSA. ""This is a particularly egregious case in which vulnerable workers, some of whom lived on the premises and spoke little English, were taken advantage of by their employer,"" said Nancy Leppink, acting administrator of the department's Wage and Hour Division. ""The employers clearly understood their legal obligations but took advantage of workers they believed would not stand up for their rights. But the workers did, and the Wage and Hour Division was able to help them. Employers have a legal obligation to abide by the wage laws of our nation and a moral obligation to treat their workers with common decency."" This is the fourth time the company has been investigated for alleged violations of the FLSA. Hamilton Avenue Animal Hospital is subject to a 2007 court-ordered injunction not to violate the FLSA as a result of an earlier Labor Department suit filed against it for failing to pay $9,225.01 in back wages to 19 employees. Those wages have since been paid. The FLSA requires that covered employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 for all hours worked, plus time and one-half their regular hourly rates, including commissions, bonuses and incentive pay, for hours worked beyond 40 per week. Employers must also maintain accurate time and payroll records. The Wage and Hour Division is responsible for enforcing federal labor laws pertaining to the minimum wage, overtime pay, recordkeeping, child labor and special employment, family and medical leave, migrant workers, lie detector tests, worker protections in certain temporary worker programs, and the prevailing wages for government service and construction contracts. Collectively, these labor standards cover most private, state and local government employment. They protect more than 135 million workers in more than 7.3 million establishments throughout the United States and its territories. For more information about the FLSA and other federal wage laws, call the division's toll-free helpline at 866-4US-WAGE (487-9243).

Plan information, such as quarterly account statements, is required to be disclosed under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, which is enforced by the department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration. “Some workers and retirees may not be sufficiently computer literate to receive information electronically or have reasonable access to the Internet, and others may simply prefer traditional paper disclosure,” said Assistant Secretary of Labor for EBSA Phyllis C. Borzi. “But in some instances, electronic disclosure may be just as effective as paper-based communications and could save employers and service providers money. We look forward to reviewing all the comments we receive on these and the other issues raised in the request for information.” The Labor Department’s request for information sets forth 30 specific questions on a broad range of topics related to electronic distribution of benefit plan information. The department hopes to hear from plan participants and beneficiaries; employers and other plan sponsors; plan administrators; plan service providers; health insurance issuers; members of the financial community; and the general public. In addition to responding to specific questions contained in the request for information, interested parties are encouraged to address any other relevant matters.

The Basic Industries facility has been designated as a star site in OSHA s Voluntary Protection Programs. Basic Industries is to be commended for demonstrating excellence in effective safety and health management, said William A. Burke, OSHA s acting regional administrator in Dallas. The company s outstanding efforts led to zero injuries and illnesses over the last three years. Basic Industries, a resident contractor at Kiewit Offshore Services in Ingleside, employs about 25 workers who perform scaffold building, abrasive blasting, painting and insulation jobs. Michael Rivera, OSHA s Corpus Christi Area Office director, and Rick Martinez, OSHA s Corpus Christi VPP coordinator, presented a plaque and flag at a ceremony today. The Voluntary Protection Programs recognize private and federal work sites with effective safety and health management systems that have maintained injury and illness rates below national Bureau of Labor Statistics averages. Management, labor and OSHA work cooperatively and proactively to prevent fatalities, injuries and illnesses through a system focused on hazard prevention and control, work site analysis and training.

"April 4, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20110404,"US Department of Labors OSHA fines North Central Farmers Elevator in Ipswich, SD, $378,000 for exposing workers to grain engulfment","BISMARCK , N.D. The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration has cited North Central Farmers Elevator in Ipswich, S.D., with six willful violations for exposing workers to being engulfed by grain. Proposed penalties total $378,000. ""It's fortunate that the North Central Farmers Elevator worker who was engulfed survived – because many don't. Grain entrapments are killing workers. Grain elevator owners and operators must implement well-known safety practices to prevent workers from being hurt or killed in a grain bin,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for OSHA Dr. David Michaels. At least 26 U.S. workers were killed in grain entrapments last year, and the numbers of entrapments are increasing, according to researchers at Purdue University. There were more grain entrapments in 2010 than in any year since Purdue researchers started collecting data on entrapments in 1978. OSHA's area office in Bismarck began an investigation at the North Central Farmers Elevator facility in October 2010 following an incident in which an employee was engulfed by corn in a grain bin. The alleged violations relate to grain and confined spaces, and address the failure of the employer to ensure that lockout/tagout procedures were followed to prevent accidental energy start-up, complete confined space and grain bin entry permits, perform required atmospheric testing, protect employees from engulfment hazards, provide an entrance observer and prohibit entry into grain bins where bridging conditions exist. A willful violation exists when an employer has demonstrated either an intentional disregard for the requirements of the law or plain indifference to employee safety and health. Since 2009, OSHA has issued fines exceeding $100,000 per employer to grain operators across the country following preventable fatalities and injuries. In addition to enforcement actions, OSHA sent a notification letter in August 2010 and another in February 2011 to a total of more than 13,000 grain elevator operators warning them of proper safety precautions, including prohibiting entry in grain storage facilities while grain is being emptied out or flowing in or out of the bin, prohibiting employees from walking down the grain and ensuring that employees enter the bin with the proper safety equipment.. ""OSHA will not tolerate noncompliance with the Grain Handling Facilities standard,"" said Michaels in both letters. ""We will continue to use our enforcement authority to the fullest extent possible."" The February 2011 letter is available at http://www.osha.gov/asst-sec/Grain-Letter-2-1-2011.html . In Denver, Colo., a regional emphasis program has been implemented for the grain handling industry to address serious hazards, and OSHA area offices in Colorado, Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota are providing assistance to help grain storage facilities comply with safety standards. At the time of the investigation, the workers' compensation carrier insuring North Central Farmers Elevator was Wausau Underwriters Insurance Co., headquartered in Boston. North Central Farmers Elevator, which operates 17 grain handling and agronomy facilities throughout North Dakota and South Dakota, has 15 business days from receipt of the citations and penalties to comply, request an informal conference with OSHA's area director or contest the findings before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.

"April 4, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20110404,Prince Georges County Public Schools charged with violating provisions of H-1B temporary foreign worker program,"US Department of Labor orders $4.2 million in back wages be paid to 1,044 teachers, fines school system $1.7 million in civil money penalties WASHINGTON  An investigation by the U.S. Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division found Maryland's Prince George's County Public Schools system in willful violation of the laws that govern the H-1B temporary foreign worker visa program. Investigators found that PGCPS illegally reduced the wages of 1,044 foreign teachers hired under the H-1B program by requiring the payment of $4,224,146 in fees. The Labor Department is responsible for ensuring H-1B workers are paid in accordance with the law and that employers do not misuse visa programs in ways that adversely affect U.S. workers. The H-1B program allows employers to hire foreign professionals to work temporarily in the U.S. So that the wages of similarly employed U.S. workers are not adversely affected, workers hired under the H-1B program must be paid at least the same wage rates and benefits as those paid to U.S. workers doing the same job in the same area. ""All employers, including school systems, are required to follow the law. That includes the legal duty to pay every teacher hired the full wages he or she is owed,"" said Nancy J. Leppink, acting administrator of the Wage and Hour Division. Due to the willful nature of some of the violations, PGCPS has been assessed $1,740,000 in civil money penalties and may be debarred from filing new petitions, requests for extensions or requests for permanent residency for foreign workers under any employment-based visa program. Violations are willful when an employer knew or acted in reckless disregard for whether its actions were impermissible. The H-1B visa program requires that employers pay certain fees incurred when they utilize the program. Instead of paying these fees, PGCPS required the foreign teachers to pay them. As a result, the teachers' earnings were reduced below the amount legally required to be paid. For more information about the requirements of the H-1B visa program, review the Wage and Hour Division's H-1B Web page at http://www.dol.gov/whd/immigration/h1b.htm .

The order and a consent judgment were obtained by the U.S. Department of Labor, resolving a lawsuit it filed alleging violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. “Fiduciaries are obligated by law to monitor employee benefit plan administrators and to deter preventable losses,” said Paul Baumann, director of the Cincinnati Regional Office of the Labor Department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration, which conducted the investigation that led to the suit. “When fiduciaries fail in their responsibilities to properly administer all aspects of benefit plans, the Labor Department will continue to help workers obtain their rightful benefits.” The department’s suit alleged that DeHeer imprudently selected Lafferty & Partners as the plan administrator and failed to monitor that company’s handling of the Hoosier Foot & Ankle LLC 401(k) Plan. As a result, the assets were stolen by the plan administrator, who was found guilty of securities fraud on unrelated charges in New Jersey in 2008. That suit was resolved when officers of Lafferty & Partners pleaded guilty and admitted that money intended for investment on behalf of clients was spent to purchase a home and pay personal expenses. In addition to repaying contributions and lost opportunity costs, the judgment requires DeHeer to pay $1,800 in civil money penalties and permanently enjoins him from violating ERISA.

I was heartbroken to hear of Sidney's death. She and their children and grandchildren are in my thoughts. ""Sidney Harman was 'quintessential LA' and 'quintessential DC.' That's what made him so special... he could navigate various worlds with ease, grace and humor. ""Most people knew Sidney as a successful businessman, philanthropist and arts patron. But among his many extraordinary accomplishments, he also had a distinguished career in public service, as deputy secretary at the U.S. Department of Commerce during the Carter administration. He was an inspiration to countless young people at the time, including me, who believed that government work was a noble calling and a way to make your own unique contribution to the world.

Solis issued the following statement on the March 2011 Employment Situation report released today: ""Our nation's labor market improved notably in the month of March. Nonfarm payroll employment increased by 216,000, and the unemployment rate decreased to 8.8 percent. Over the last four months, the unemployment rate has fallen by a full percentage point – its largest decline since 1984. ""Today's numbers highlight steady, sustained and widespread job growth. Private employment has now grown for 13 consecutive months, with February and March showing the strongest growth since early 2006. And since its low point in February 2010, private sector employment has risen by 1.8 million. ""The bottom line: The policies and programs of this administration are working. ""But we know there's still more work to be done for the millions of people who are either out of work or struggling to offset their rising costs with shrinking paychecks. It's why one of President Obama's goals has been to ensure a cleaner, safer and more secure energy future. And it's why, this week, he laid out a plan that will finally break our dependence on foreign oil and move our nation toward a clean energy economy that creates jobs and keeps America competitive. ""The growth of the clean energy economy will bring significant changes to the American workplace and require workers to acquire new and different skills. At the Labor Department, we are providing the training that will turn 20th century blue-collar jobs into secure 21st century green-collar jobs, while paving a pathway out of poverty; strengthening urban and rural communities; rebuilding a strong middle class; and protecting the health of our citizens and planet. ""We face big challenges, and fixing them will require a lot of hard work and sacrifice from everyone. But if we're willing to come together and find common ground on these issues, then we can win the future. We can lay the foundation for American competiveness for years to come and give this generation, and pass on to the next, the type of America that our parents and grandparents left for us. ""While the employment situation is clearly improving, my mission remains the same: to create good and safe jobs for everyone. It is what the American people are counting on and a goal we will continue to keep at the forefront of everything we do."""

The Arizona-incorporated company, which contracts with major utility companies to install underground utilities, has main offices in Hesperia and is licensed in eight states: Arizona, California, Nevada, Utah, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington and Texas. It maintains construction yards in Phoenix and Tucson, Ariz.; Corona and Indio, Calif.; and Las Vegas and Carson City, Nev. The company specializes in gas distribution; long line pipeline; power distribution and transmission; fiber optics placement; engineering and design; and sewer, water and storm drains. ""There is no excuse to deny workers the wages they have worked hard to earn. All businesses have an obligation to pay their employees fairly and must comply with federal labor laws,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""Cheating workers out of time spent on the job — whether performing work-related tasks, traveling or attending a meeting — is unacceptable."" Investigators determined that Arizona Pipeline Co. did not pay employees for pre-shift and post-shift time required for loading and unloading material, cleaning trucks or picking up equipment. Additionally, workers were not compensated for travel time from the company yard to job sites and back, and they were required to attend a one-hour monthly meeting that was unpaid. The company also docked a half-hour lunch time from employees' pay even though they typically had a 15-minute lunch period or worked through their lunch periods. This investigation was conducted by the Wage and Hour Division's West Covina District Office and covered a two-year period beginning in November 2007. Of the 740 affected employees, 487 are in California, 244 are in Arizona and nine are in Nevada. The FLSA requires that covered employees be paid for attending required meetings, and for pre-shift and post-shift job duties. Employees also must be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 for all hours worked, plus time and one-half their regular rates of pay, including commissions, bonuses and incentive pay, for hours worked beyond 40 per week. Additionally, employers must maintain accurate time and payroll records. For more information about the FLSA, call the Wage and Hour Division's toll-free helpline at 866-4US-WAGE (487-9243).

"March 29, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20110329,Levi Strauss agrees to pay more than $1 million in overtime back wages to nearly 600 employees following US Labor Department investigation,"Overtime violations found at retail stores nationwide SAN FRANCISCO — Levi Strauss & Co. has agreed to pay $1,011,413 in overtime back wages to 596 employees nationwide after the U.S. Department of Labor found that the company violated overtime and recordkeeping provisions of the federal Fair Labor Standards Act. An investigation conducted by the San Francisco District Office of the Labor Department's Wage and Hour Division determined that the San Francisco-based company misclassified several groups of workers, including assistant store managers of newly acquired stores, as exempt from overtime. Although their counterparts at previously existing stores were exempt from overtime compensation, the newly hired employees were not. ""Misclassification of employees has serious and adverse consequences for employees, as well as for corporations,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""When violations of federal labor laws are discovered, this department will take appropriate action to ensure that workers receive the wages they deserve."" The company failed to record all hours employees worked in its payroll system. Instead, the misclassified assistant store managers were required to work off-the-clock during late night closings, early morning openings and staffing shortages. Various administrative employees working at the company's headquarters also were misclassified as exempt from FLSA coverage and found to be owed overtime back wages. This investigation covered back wages for time worked over a two-year period. Levi Strauss has agreed to pay the back wages and committed to upgrade its time and attendance system, as well as maintain future compliance with the law. The applicable employees are now treated as non-exempt under the FLSA. Founded in San Francisco in 1853, Levi Strauss was the first company to manufacture blue jeans. Today, the company operates 164 retail stores and employs more than 4,000 workers in the U.S., and its global operations span more than 100 countries. The FLSA requires that covered employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 for all hours worked, plus time and one-half their regular rates of pay, including commissions, bonuses and incentive pay, for hours worked beyond 40 per week. Employers are required to keep accurate records of all hours worked by covered employees. The FLSA provides an exemption from both minimum wage and overtime pay for workers employed as bona fide executive, administrative, professional and outside sales employees. It also exempts certain computer employees. To qualify, employees generally must meet certain tests described in the act regarding their job duties. For more information about the FLSA, call the Wage and Hour Division's San Francisco office at 415-625-7720 or its toll-free helpline at 866-4US-WAGE (487-9243).

"March 28, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20110328,MSHA announces results of February impact inspections,"ARLINGTON, Va. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration today announced that federal inspectors issued 166 citations and orders during special impact inspections conducted at seven coal mines and one dimension stone quarry last month. The seven coal mines were issued 127 citations and four orders; the quarry operation was issued 27 citations and eight orders. Special impact inspections, which began in force last April following the explosion at the Upper Big Branch Mine, involve mines that merit increased agency attention and enforcement due to their poor compliance history or particular compliance concerns, including high numbers of violations or closure orders; indications of operator tactics, such as advance notification of inspections that prevent inspectors from observing violations; frequent hazard complaints or hotline calls; plan compliance issues; inadequate workplace examinations; a high number of accidents, injuries or illnesses; fatalities; and adverse conditions such as increased methane liberation, faulty roof conditions and inadequate ventilation. ""MSHA has been conducting these targeted inspections for nearly a year and, while some operators have been responsive and showed a willingness to change, others continue to commit the same serious violations,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""We are using all the enforcement tools at our disposal, but Congress has the capability to enhance those tools."" On Feb. 18, 2011, an inspection party arrived during the evening shift at D & C Mining Corp. in Harlan County, Ky. The inspectors captured and monitored the phones to prevent advance notification of their arrival and, as a result of the inspection, issued 17 citations and one order. Two-thirds of those issuances were designated as significant and substantial violations. This visit marked the fourth impact inspection conducted at this mine since April 2010. A 104(b) order, which closed an entire section of the mine, was issued because the mine operator failed to provide a refuge alternative for miners on the active working section to use in the event of a mine fire, explosion or other emergency. D & C Mining also was cited for an inoperable emergency communications system in the primary escapeway, as well as for a number of violations that presented a fire or explosion risk, including failure to comply with the dust controls portion of its ventilation plan, electrical violations such as inadequate electrical exams and failure to follow its approved plan to prevent smoking articles from entering the mine. In some cases, follow-ups to impact inspections have shown significant compliance improvements. For example, in September 2010, MSHA conducted an impact inspection at the Fulkroad Quarry, a limestone quarry in Juniata County, Pa. MSHA issued 35 citations and one imminent danger order. During the next regular inspection in January 2011, MSHA issued just four citations, an 89 percent decrease. In October 2010, during an impact inspection at WW Manchester Construction Co.'s WW Manchester mine in Hartford, Conn., MSHA issued 17 citations. MSHA found no violations during a subsequent spot inspection one month later. Other mines have not been as responsive in fixing problems. At Left Fork Mining Co. Inc.'s Straight Creek No. 1, a coal mine in Bell County, Ky., MSHA found serious violations during both regular inspections and two impact inspections conducted in April and September 2010. On Nov. 19, Straight Creek received a notice that it had a potential pattern of violations. A notice provides warning that the mine will be placed on a pattern of violations, requiring MSHA to issue closure orders for all significant and substantial safety violations, if necessary improvements are not made within the required timeframe. From Nov. 19 until Dec. 7, 2010, during another impact inspection, Straight Creek was issued 94 citations and orders, including 10 104(d) withdrawal orders and four 104(b) withdrawal orders for failing to abate prior violations. The 104(b) orders prohibited any work except that necessary to abate the prior violations. Straight Creek ceased production on Dec. 8, 2010. Since that time, Straight Creek has been issued more than 50 additional citations and orders, including 23 more 104(b) orders for failing to fix previously cited violations. Straight Creek's potential pattern of violations evaluation period has been suspended until production resumes. This mine previously had been cited for notifying mining personnel that MSHA inspectors were on-site and subsequently received an injunction in federal court. Since April 2010, MSHA has conducted 228 impact inspections. These inspections have resulted in 4,268 citations, 396 orders and 13 safeguards.

"March 25, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20110325,US Department of Labors OSHA applauds decision upholding citation against Wal-Mart Stores Inc. in crowd management fatality case,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration today applauded a ruling by Chief Administrative Law Judge Covette Rooney of the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission upholding the citation and full penalty issued to Wal-Mart Stores Inc. for inadequate crowd management following a November 2008 trampling death of a worker at one of the company's retail locations in New York. ""This is a win for both workers and consumers. Its only fitting that today, the 100th anniversary of the deadly Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire in New York City where 146 workers lost their lives, a judge affirmed OSHA's right to protect the safety and health of workers from clearly recognized hazards,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health Dr. David Michaels. ""Todays ruling supports OSHAs position that, even in the absence of a specific rule or standard, employers are still legally responsible for providing a place of employment free of recognized hazards that are likely to cause serious injury or death. If not properly managed by retailers, a large crowd poses a significant threat to the lives of workers and customers."" In May 2009, OSHA cited Wal-Mart Stores Inc. for inadequate crowd management, concluding an investigation launched after a worker was trampled to death on Nov. 28, 2008, at a Wal-Mart store in Valley Stream, N.Y. The worker was knocked to the ground and crushed by a crowd of about 2,000 shoppers surging into the store for its annual ""Blitz Friday"" holiday sales event. OSHA's inspection found that the store's workers were at risk of being crushed by the crowd due to the store's failure to implement reasonable and effective crowd management practices. Those practices would have provided the store's workers with the necessary training and tools to safely manage a large crowd of shoppers. Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act's general duty clause, OSHA issued Wal-Mart Stores Inc. one serious citation for exposing workers to the recognized hazards of asphyxiation or being crushed by a crowd. The citation carried a proposed fine of $7,000, the maximum penalty amount for a serious violation allowed under the law. A violation is serious when death or serious physical harm is likely to result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known. ""During the course of OSHA's investigation, the company implemented crowd control measures storewide, and the National Retail Federation also promoted those practices to its members,"" said Michaels. ""We praise that action, and urge all retailers to implement crowd management practices ahead of future sales events likely to draw large crowds.""

Additionally, an OSHA fact sheet on crowd management measures is available online at https://www.osha.gov/OshDoc/data_General_Facts/Crowd_Control.html . Wal-Mart Stores Inc. disputed the May 2009 OSHA citation before the OSHRC, an independent federal agency created to decide contests of citations or penalties resulting from inspections of American workplaces by OSHA. An employer who is cited by OSHA for an alleged workplace health or safety violation(s) can contest the citation(s) and have the case heard by a commission administrative law judge, who ultimately issues a decision. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. has 20 days from the date Rooney's decision is docketed with OSHRC to appeal to its commissioners, whose members are presidential appointees. For more information about the commission, visit http://www.oshrc.gov . OSHA's safety inspection was conducted by the agency's Long Island Area Office. The case was litigated for OSHA by Jeffrey Rogoff, Darren Cohen, Kathryn L. Stewart, Sudwiti Chanda and Diane C. Sherman of the Labor Department's Regional Office of the Solicitor in New York. Under the OSH Act of 1970, OSHA's role is to promote safe and healthful working conditions for America's men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, outreach and education.

""This is an opportunity for OSHA and members of the oil and gas industry to come together through forums, roundtable discussions, meetings and conferences to discuss safety and health issues associated with production, drilling and transportation operations,"" said William Burke, OSHA's acting regional administrator in Dallas. ""The joint resources of this relationship will help make the oil and gas industry as safe and healthful as possible."" South Louisiana STEPS was initiated in September 2009 and is patterned after the successful South Texas Exploration and Production Safety Network. STEPS provides a forum for industry employers, contractors and employees to meet on a monthly basis; discuss best practices and lessons learned within the industry; and disperse crucial information to enhance workplace safety. Additionally, the network provides small businesses with information needed to build an effective safety and health management system.

Virtually all employees engaged in agriculture are covered by federal law because they produce goods for interstate commerce. ""The Labor Department is committed to enforcing labor standards that protect and enhance the welfare of the nation's farmworkers,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""Through outreach, we are spreading the word to farm labor contractors and growers that they must pay their workers the wages they have earned."" This coming spring, Wage and Hour Division investigators will make unannounced visits to farms in South Florida to ensure that employers are following federal labor laws. Over the past year, investigators have been meeting with farm groups to inform them of their responsibilities regarding agricultural employees. ""Each employer is also responsible for ensuring workers' health and safety,"" added Secretary Solis. ""Workers should not have to lose their lives or risk their health while working to provide for their families."" The FLSA sets standards for minimum wage, overtime payments and limitations on child labor. The law allows, with restrictions, the employment of farmworkers between ages 12 and 16. There are no restrictions on workers age 16 and older employed in farm jobs. The FLSA prohibits the employment of most individuals under age 16 in hazardous occupations. Youths of any age may work at any time and perform any job on a farm owned or operated by their parents. Otherwise, individuals under age 12 may not be employed in farm activities. Most agricultural employers, agricultural associations and farm labor contractors are subject to the MSPA, which protects migrant and seasonal agricultural workers by establishing employment standards related to wages, housing, transportation, disclosures and recordkeeping. The MSPA also requires farm labor contractors to register with the Labor Department. The department maintains a list of individuals or corporations whose authorization to operate as a farm labor contractor has been revoked. To determine whether a contractor has been declared ineligible, visit http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/statutes/mspa_debar.htm . Field sanitation provisions of the OSH Act require covered employers to provide toilets, potable drinking water, hand-washing facilities and information regarding good hygiene practices.

The lawsuit alleges that the defendants failed to remit employee contributions to the plan from 2006 through 2009, and used the money to fund corporate operations and pay other creditors. “This case demonstrates a clear breach of fiduciary duty on the part of the company and its officer,” said Mabel Capolongo, regional director of the Labor Department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration in Philadelphia. “When plan fiduciaries fail to act in the best interest of plan participants, they will be held accountable.” Filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, the suit seeks to restore to the plan all losses, including interest, lost opportunity costs and the cost of an independent fiduciary. The suit also seeks to permanently bar the company and Berkopec from serving in a fiduciary capacity to any employee benefit plan covered by ERISA. Berkopec filed for individual bankruptcy protection under Chapter 7 on Oct. 26, 2010. Under a separate legal action, the department filed an adversary complaint in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Virginia to prevent him from discharging any debt he owes to the plan. McIntyre Construction Inc. is a residential construction company. This case is part of EBSA’s national enforcement initiative to safeguard workers’ contributions to 401(k) and health benefit plans. The department’s legal action resulted from an investigation by EBSA’s Washington District Office in Silver Spring, Md., and the cases were filed by the department’s regional solicitor in Philadelphia.

This proposal would require those employers already mandated to keep injury and illness records to add the step of checking a column when recording work-related musculoskeletal disorders. Small businesses from around the country are encouraged to participate in the teleconferences. The first will be held on Monday, April 11 at 1:30 p.m. EDT. The second and third will be held Tuesday, April 12, 2011, at 9 a.m. EDT and 1:30 p.m. EDT. Participants may provide input about their experiences in recording work-related MSDs and how they believe the proposed rule would impact them. The proposed rule only covers MSDs that employers are already required to record under the longstanding OSHA rule on recordkeeping. Prior to 2001, OSHA's injury and illness logs contained a column for repetitive trauma disorders that included hearing loss and many kinds of MSDs. In 2001, OSHA proposed separating hearing loss and MSDs into two columns, but the MSD column was deleted in 2003 before the provision became effective. OSHA's proposal would restore the MSD column to the Form 300. Interested businesses that wish to participate in one of the teleconferences should contact Regina Powers at powers.regina@dol.gov by April 4, and indicate the teleconference in which they wish to participate.

""Competency models outline the knowledge and skills needed by workers in specific industries, and are helpful tools to ensure that our workforce is prepared to fill important occupations,"" said Jane Oates, assistant secretary for the Employment and Training Administration. ""There is a growing need for professionals who enhance the health and well-being of people with disabilities, and care providers who work with aging adults, enabling them to live self-determined lives."" The LTCSS model describes the academic, workplace and technical competencies required for workers who provide social services, community supports and health care services for those in need. By focusing on the skills requirements of workers in occupations serving nursing, assisted living, congregate care and independent assisted living facilities, the model helps to highlight transferable skills that can be applied across these related fields. The model reflects the recommendations of subject matter expert organizations including the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the American Health Care Association, the Paraprofessional Healthcare Institute, the American Network of Community Options and Resources, the College of Direct Support, the National Center for Assisted Living, the University of Minnesota Institute on Community Integration, the University of Alaska-Anchorage Center for Human Development and the National Alliance for Direct Support Professionals.

"March 17, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20110317-0,US Labor Department issues proposed rulemaking revising H-2B program,"Proposed rule seeks to enhance access to jobs, benefits and protections for US workers WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor's Employment and Training Administration and its Wage and Hour Division today announced the publication of a proposed rule that seeks to improve the H-2B temporary nonagricultural worker program. The proposed rule, to be published in the March 18 edition of the Federal Register , includes changes to several aspects of the program to ensure that U.S. workers receive the same level of protections and benefits as temporary foreign workers recruited under the H-2B program, and to provide better access for employers with legitimate labor needs. The H-2B program allows the entry of foreign workers into the United States on a temporary basis when qualified U.S. workers are not available and when the employment of those foreign workers will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of similarly employed U.S. workers. The H-2B program is limited by law to a program cap of 66,000 visas per year. ""As our economy continues to recover, it is important for U.S. workers to receive access to all jobs, and that the H-2B program is used as it was intended,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""At the same time, workers employed through the H-2B program must be treated fairly."" In order to streamline and improve the program for employers, the proposed rule would create an H-2B registration process that would allow employers to conduct labor market tests closer to their date of need before applying for a certification. It also would eliminate job contractors as users of the program. The department further proposes to improve U.S. workers' access to jobs and increase worker protections by creating a national job registry for all H-2B job postings; requiring employers to provide documentation that they have taken appropriate steps to recruit U.S. workers, rather than permitting employers to attest to such compliance; enhancing transparency by requiring employers to submit agency agreements and through the use of foreign recruiters; reinstating the role of state workforce agencies in providing expertise on local labor market conditions and recruitment patterns; and increasing the amount of time during which U.S. workers must be recruited. Additionally, the department proposes to extend H-2B program benefits to workers employed alongside those recruited under the H-2B program; require employers to pay transportation costs and other fees; and enhance enforcement by giving the department's Wage and Hour Division independent debarment authority. To view a copy of the forthcoming Federal Register notice, visit http://s.dol.gov/DK.

"March 17, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20110317,"US Labor Department obtains court-appointed independent fiduciary for 401(k) plan abandoned by defunct Sherrill, NY, employer","NEW YORK – The U.S. Department of Labor has obtained a court order appointing an independent fiduciary to manage the abandoned 401(k) plan of Swigonski Management Group, formerly located in Sherrill. Under the order, entered in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York, the court appointed M. Larry Lefoldt of Lefoldt & Co. PA to serve as the independent fiduciary of the Swigonski Management Group 401(k) Plan. The independent fiduciary has the authority to manage the plan, distribute its assets to eligible participants and beneficiaries, and terminate the plan. The order resolves a lawsuit filed by the Labor Department in November 2010. The department's suit alleged that Robert Swigonski stopped performing his fiduciary duties on behalf of the plan without ensuring the appointment of a new fiduciary. He was the owner of the company and the trustee of the 401(k) plan, which had assets totaling $24,182 as of January 2009, the latest data available. The Swigonski Management Group 401(k) Plan, which provided retirement benefits for employees of three franchise restaurants, was sponsored by the company from January 2000 until it ceased operations in February 2006. The restaurants included Benny's 1, Two Benny's and Benny's 3. As a result of the plan's abandonment, participants have been unable to access their 401(k) accounts. Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, plans must be managed by named fiduciaries. In the absence of a plan fiduciary, participants and beneficiaries cannot obtain plan information, make investments or collect retirement benefits. ""When an employee benefit plan is abandoned, so are the workers who invested in it,"" said Edward Maloney, acting regional director of the Labor Department's Employee Benefits Security Administration in Boston. ""We took this legal action to ensure that the plan is properly managed so that its participants can finally gain access to their retirement assets."" The case was investigated by EBSA's Boston Regional Office.

"March 16, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20110316,"US Labor Departments OSHA cites Gavilon Grain for willful, other safety violations following death of 20-year-old worker at Morral facility","Company receives 46 safety and health violations at 3 Ohio facilities MORRAL, Ohio – The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration has cited Gavilon Grain LLC in Morral following the September 2010 death of a 20-year-old worker who was caught in a discharge auger while cleaning out a grain bin. ""This tragic death could have been prevented had the grain bin owner and operators followed occupational safety standards and learned from the tragedies that have occurred at other grain bins,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for OSHA Dr. David Michaels. ""Grain elevator owners and operators must implement well-known safety practices to prevent workers from being hurt or killed in a grain bin."" At least 25 U.S. workers were killed in grain entrapments last year, and the numbers of entrapments are increasing, according to researchers at Purdue University. There were more grain entrapments in 2010 than in any year since the university started collecting data on entrapments in 1978. Following inspections at its Morral, West Jefferson and Harpster grain bin facilities, the company is being cited for 46 safety and health violations with penalties totaling $465,500. Gavilon Grain's Morral facility was issued a total of eight safety citations with proposed penalties of $175,000, including two willful citations for failing to lock out the discharge and sweep auger, and to provide an appropriate grain bin entry permit to perform work. A willful violation is one committed with intentional knowing or voluntary disregard for the law's requirements, or with plain indifference to worker safety and health. Five serious citations were issued for failing to train employees in safety precautions and bin entry procedures, not having an observer during bin entry, failing to have rescue equipment, failing to test the atmosphere in the space to be entered and failing to have deflagration controls for combustible dust. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known. One other-than-serious citation was issued for not having combustible dust warning signs in place. An other-than-serious violation is one that has a direct relationship to job safety and health, but probably would not cause death or serious physical harm. As a result of violations discovered at the Morral facility, OSHA initiated inspections at the company's West Jefferson and Harpster facilities. The West Jefferson facility was fined $171,000 and cited with a total of 22 health and safety violations, including two repeat safety violations for allowing employees to walk working surfaces without proper guarding in place and failing to safeguard employees from electrical hazards such as broken electrical conduits. A repeat violation exists when an employer previously has been cited for the same or a similar violation of a standard, regulation, rule or order at any other facility in federal enforcement states within the last five years. Thirteen serious safety citations were issued for allowing employees to walk working surfaces without ladderway gates and mid-rails, and exposing workers to electrical and machine guarding hazards. Four serious health citations were issued for a lack of safe grain handling and electrical procedures. Three other-than-serious health citations were issued for lack of signage and hazard communication procedures. The company's facility in Harpster was fined $119,500 and cited with a total of 16 safety violations, including one willful violation for failing to evaluate work spaces to determine if any required confined space entry permits. Fourteen serious citations were issued for failing to implement a confined space program, not having a non-entry retrieval system, a lack of personal protective equipment for employees, a lack of electrical training, a lack of combustible dust controls and failing to train employees in combustible grain dust hazards. One other-than-serious citation was issued for a lack of combustible dust warning signs. Gavilon Grain LLC, which operates as Peavey Co. in Ohio, is a subsidiary of Omaha, Neb.-based Gavilon Group LLC. Prior to these inspections, Gavilon Group facilities in Nebraska and Delaware were issued citations in 2010 and 2009, respectively, including citations for the grain handling standard. Since 2009, OSHA has fined grain operators in Illinois, Colorado, South Dakota and Wisconsin following similar preventable fatalities and injuries. In addition to enforcement actions and training, OSHA sent a notification letter in August 2010 to grain elevator operators warning them not to allow workers to enter grain storage facilities without proper equipment. ""OSHA will not tolerate noncompliance with the Grain Handling Facilities standard,"" said Michaels in the letter. ""We will continue to use our enforcement authority to the fullest extent possible."" For a copy of the letter, visit http://www.osha.gov/asst-sec/Grain_letter.html . OSHA's Region V, which includes Illinois, Ohio and Wisconsin, initiated a Grain Safety Local Emphasis Program in August 2010, and has since conducted 61 inspections and issued 163 citations to grain operators/facilities. The violations cover hazards associated with grain engulfment, machine guarding, lockout/tagout of dangerous equipment to prevent accidental energization start-up, electricity, falls, employee training and combustible dust hazards. These investigations also fall under the requirements of OSHA's Severe Violators Enforcement Program. Initiated in the spring of 2010, the program is intended to focus on recalcitrant employers that endanger workers by committing willful, repeat or failure-to-abate violations in one or more of the following circumstances: a fatality or catastrophe; industry operations or processes that expose workers to severe occupational hazards; exposure to hazards related to the potential releases of highly hazardous chemicals; and all per-instance citation (egregious) enforcement actions. For more information about the Severe Violators Enforcement Program, visit http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=DIRECTIVES&p_id=4503 . The company has 15 business days from receipt of the citations and penalties to comply, request an informal conference with OSHA's area director or contest the findings before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. Employers and employees with questions regarding workplace safety and health standards can call OSHA's Toledo Area Office at 419-259-6393. To report workplace incidents, fatalities or situations posing imminent danger to workers, call the agency's toll-free hotline at 800-321-OSHA (6742). Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. OSHA's role is to ensure these conditions for America's working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education and assistance."
"March 16, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20110316,US Department of Labor announces 2 grant competitions to provide career training and housing to farmworkers,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor today announced two grant competitions for the National Farmworker Jobs Program. One competition will fund organizations that will provide training, the other housing services, to migrant and seasonal farmworkers and their families. ""Our nation's prosperity is linked to the labors of farmworkers across the United States,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""By supporting skills training and related housing services for farmworkers, the Labor Department will help them improve their career outcomes, and that is a win for all of us."" The National Farmworker Jobs Program helps farmworkers upgrade their agricultural job skills or acquire new ones in occupations that offer higher wages and more stable employment. In addition, the program provides supportive services such as child care, health care and transportation. These services remove barriers to farmworkers beginning or remaining in training, and enable them to retain their employment. The housing portion of the program allows organizations to provide permanent housing assistance, temporary and/or emergency housing assistance, or a combination of both. Specific types of activities allowed are defined in the solicitation for grant applications. Typically, housing assistance grantees provide these services in more than one state or areas of a single state. The National Farmworker Jobs Program is authorized by Congress in Section 167 of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 to counter the impact of chronic unemployment and underemployment experienced by migrant and seasonal farmworkers who depend primarily on agricultural jobs. Eligible applicants include, but are not limited to, community-based and public agencies that assist farmworkers and their families in attaining greater economic stability. This competition is being conducted before the passage of the Department of Labor's fiscal year 2011 appropriation in anticipation of funds being made available for National Farmworker Jobs Program grants, but the department will not obligate any funds for 2011 grants until they are appropriated by Congress. Notices of both solicitations for grant applications will be published in the March 17 edition of the Federal Register .

"March 16, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20110316-0,"Miami tool manufacturer agrees to restore more than $107,000 to company’s pension profit sharing plan following US Labor Department investigation","MIAMI – The U.S. Department of Labor has obtained a consent judgment that restores more than $107,775 to participants in the Miami-based Michigan Drill Corp. Profit Sharing Plan. The judgment, approved by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, Miami Division, requires the defendants – Republic Drill/APT Corp. and Hyman Ash, owner of both this company and its predecessor company, Michigan Drill Corp. – to fund the plan for the benefit of participants who will receive allocations based on their percentage of interest in the plan as of Dec. 31, 2009. Ash agrees to waive his interest in the plan and to complete eight hours of fiduciary training annually for as long as he remains a fiduciary of a plan covered by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The Labor Department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration alleged that the defendants caused losses to the company’s pension profit sharing plan through improper activities that violated ERISA. Specifically, defendants allegedly allowed the plan to extend a line of credit to Tool & Equipment Sales Co. which became a prohibited transaction when Republic Drill/APT Corp. later acquired the company. In 2001, the outstanding balance on the loan exceeded $596,000. The defendants failed to collect payments when the loan was in default, and the plan incurred losses when the outstanding balance was not paid in full. The defendants also allowed the plan to purchase artwork and real estate assets but did not regularly require independent appraisals of the assets to determine their true value. “It is important that these funds are being restored for the benefit of pension plan participants who are counting on them for their retirement,” said R.C. Marshall, EBSA regional administrator in Atlanta. “The Labor Department is vigorously working to ensure that employees’ pensions are safe and available to them.” This case resulted from an investigation conducted by EBSA’s Atlanta Regional Office.

The company also operated under the name ElaStar Community Hospital. The lawsuit alleges that from Nov. 5, 2002, through Aug. 6, 2004, defendants ElaStar, Andrea Kofl and Richard Yardley caused ElaStar Community Hospital to fail to remit to the retirement plan $412,886.63 in employee contributions and participant loan repayments withheld from employees’ paychecks. Instead, the defendants retained and comingled the money in the accounts of the hospital. The defendants also allegedly failed to timely forward contributions and loan repayments to the plan, resulting in deposits being made up to 301 days late. At the time of the violations, Kofl and Yardley were the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, respectively, of ElaStar and shareholders of Star Healthcare Group, the parent company of ElaStar. In addition, the suit alleges that ElaStar, Kofl and Yardley violated ERISA by causing the plan to suffer losses and lost opportunity income as a result of their improper actions. The suit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, Western Division. The suit seeks a court order to require that the defendants restore all losses and lost opportunity income owed to the plan and correct any transactions prohibited by law. The suit also asks the court to permanently bar Kofl and Yardley from serving in a fiduciary capacity to any plan governed by ERISA in the future, to appoint an independent fiduciary to manage the plan, to hold all assets of the plan in trust, to wind down the affairs of the plan, and to distribute assets of the plan to eligible participants and beneficiaries. “These defendants had a legal obligation to protect workers’ contributions to the retirement plan,” said Crisanta Johnson, regional director of the Labor Department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration in Los Angeles. The plan, which provided retirement, death or disability benefits, covered 109 participants and had $1,625,723 in assets as of Dec. 31, 2004, the latest data available. This case is part of EBSA’s national enforcement initiative to safeguard workers’ contributions to 401(k) and health benefit plans.

"March 15, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20110315,"Review board affirms US Labor Department recovery of more than $792,000 in back wages for 79 employees on New York Citys Vladeck Houses project","Construction company also debarred from federal government contracts for 3 years NEW YORK — Following an investigation by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Wage and Hour Division, the department’s Administrative Review Board issued a final agency determination ordering Pythagoras General Contracting Corp., a construction contractor based in Long Island City, to pay $792,396 in back wages for 79 employees. The board also affirmed that Pythagoras and company president Stanley Petsagourakis are debarred from working on future federally funded contracts for three years. An investigation conducted by the Wage and Hour Division’s Brooklyn Area Office determined that Pythagoras violated the wage and benefit requirements of the Davis-Bacon Act and the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act while working on a partially federally funded New York City Housing Authority construction project at Vladeck Houses. “The department will not hesitate to pursue legal action, including debarment, to ensure employees working on federally assisted projects are properly paid under the law,” said Nancy J. Leppink, acting administrator for the Wage and Hour Division. Pythagoras failed to pay some employees at the prevailing wage rate for the skilled labor actually performed due to misclassification of the employees under the Davis-Bacon Act and routinely failed to pay some employees for all hours worked on the project. Following the contractor’s appeal of an administrative law judge decision in this case, the board ordered the back wage payments and determined Pythagoras’ willful underpayment of wages and failure to pay for all hours worked justified debarment from receiving future government contracts for a three-year period. The DBA requires all contractors and subcontractors performing work on federal and certain federally funded projects to pay their laborers and mechanics the proper prevailing wage rates and fringe benefits as determined by the Department of Labor. In addition, the CWHSSA requires contractors and subcontractors to pay laborers and mechanics one and one-half times their basic rate of pay for all hours worked over 40 in a week.

"March 11, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20110311-0,US Labor Department sues trustee of defunct Maine company employee stock ownership plan to restore losses to the plan,"BOSTON – The U.S. Department of Labor has sued Stephen Thomas, individually and as trustee of the defunct Gagne Precast Concrete Products Inc. Employee Stock Ownership Plan, for alleged violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act that cost the plan millions of dollars in losses. ERISA is the federal law that protects the assets and participants of private sector employee benefit plans. Gagne Precast Concrete Products Inc. was located in Veazie, Maine, just outside of Bangor. The department filed its lawsuit against Thomas with the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania since he now resides in York, Pa. The suit was filed following an investigation by the Labor Department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration. The suit alleges that Thomas, who was an owner and manager of a private equity firm, ECG Equity Investors LLC, based in Washington, D.C., orchestrated a leveraged buyout of Gagne Concrete in February 2005. The buyout involved the creation of an employee stock ownership plan that, in turn, purchased 100 percent of the company’s common stock through a financing deal. Thomas, as trustee of the plan, violated his fiduciary duties by causing it to pay more than fair market value in purchasing shares of the company’s stock. Specifically, the suit alleges that Thomas approved the plan’s purchase of stock for approximately $3.9 million. To support this purchase price, he relied unreasonably on a valuation opinion that was based on stale and inaccurate data, unrealistic growth and risk assumptions, and other obvious flaws. The suit further alleges that the stock purchase was a prohibited transaction because Thomas simultaneously represented both the plan and his private equity company, which received numerous benefits in the deal, including equity instruments that directly reduced the plan’s ownership interest in the company. Finally, Thomas misappropriated and diverted at least $1,142,889.99 in assets away from the company without a legitimate purpose. He violated his duty of loyalty to the plan by failing to protect plan assets from dissipation. The complaint seeks injunctions prohibiting the defendant from future violations of ERISA and preventing him from serving as a fiduciary or service provider to any ERISA-covered employee benefit plan in the future, as well as restitution of all losses caused to the plan. This case was investigated by the EBSA Boston Regional Office and was litigated by the department’s regional solicitor in Boston. Employers and workers can contact that office at 617-565-9600 or EBSA’s toll-free number, 866-444-3272, for help with any problems relating to private sector pension and health plans.

Prior to the final entry of the consent judgment and order, the 401(k) plan’s insurance policy paid $46,324.44 for the restoration of un-remitted employee contributions. The judgment follows an investigation conducted by the Department of Labor into alleged violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The court ordered Premier Properties USA Inc. and its trustees to restore the lost opportunity costs attributable to voluntary employee contributions withheld from employees’ wages but not remitted to the 401(k) plan from Jan. 1 through March 18, 2008. Premier Properties USA Inc. and White are permanently barred from serving as fiduciaries to any ERISA-covered employee benefit plan. Further, all defendants are removed from serving as fiduciaries to this 401(k) plan, and an independent fiduciary has been appointed by the court to administer the plan. Money owed to the plan was repaid after litigation began in this case. At the time of the violations, White was president of the company, Schnettgoecke was vice president and Smith was general counsel. The EBSA Cincinnati Regional Office conducted the investigation.

The grants are being awarded under the department's Homeless Veterans' Reintegration Program. ""Stand Down events across the country will reach thousands of homeless veterans – including homeless female veterans – with opportunities to re-enter America's workforce,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis, who is also chair of the Interagency Council on Homelessness. ""Through these grants, the federal government will engage states and local communities as active partners in readying those who have served our nation for civilian jobs."" Stand Down is a military term referring to a brief respite from combat. Stand Down community events are held by local organizations that provide veterans with a wide range of social services such as food, clothing, shelter, housing and employment assistance. In 2010, more than 160 organizations across the country partnered with local businesses, government agencies, and community and faith-based service providers to hold 81 Stand Down events for homeless veterans and their families. Stand Down grant funds must be used to enhance employment and training opportunities or to promote the self-sufficiency of homeless veterans through paid work. Homeless individuals do not always have access to the basic supplies necessary to maintain their health and self-confidence. In addition, a lack of shelter and related resources often limits the ability of people who are homeless to prepare for job interviews, make a positive impression on prospective employers or be contacted for follow-up. Basic services such as showers, haircuts, attention to health concerns and other collaborative services provided at Stand Down events can improve participants' chances of connecting with community-based service providers, and securing and maintaining employment. Grantees operating within the Homeless Veterans' Reintegration Program network will sponsor Stand Down events by coordinating their efforts with various local, state and federal service providers. Applications for Stand Down grants will be accepted from state workforce agencies, state and local workforce investment boards, veterans service organizations, local public agencies and nonprofit organizations, including community and faith-based organizations.

Investigations conducted by the Labor Department's Wage and Hour Division found that 1760 Society Inc., doing business as The Sherborn Inn and The Sherborn Out in Sherborn, and D'Ann's Restaurant Inc., doing business as D'Ann's in Abington, had misclassified employees and, as a result, violated the Fair Labor Standards Act by denying them proper compensation for all hours worked. The Wage and Hour Division determined that the Sherborn restaurants and D'Ann's contracted with Operations Management Group, a staffing agency, to move many of their existing employees to OMG's payroll, resulting in the employees receiving less pay than the law requires. The restaurants set the hourly rate the employees would be paid and would report to OMG the number of hours each employee worked. Although the employees had received overtime pay when they were on the restaurants' payrolls, OMG paid them ""straight time"" at the rate set by the restaurants for all hours worked, including overtime hours, and failed to withhold tax deductions from their wages. New workers were also put on the OMG payroll and were likewise paid improperly. The misclassification of employees as independent contractors is an alarming trend, particularly in industries that employ many low-wage workers and in which the Wage and Hour Division historically has found significant wage violations, such as the restaurant industry. ""The Wage and Hour Division wants to send a strong message that employers cannot evade their responsibility under the law by using staffing agencies or labor contractors,"" said Nancy J. Leppink, acting administrator of the Wage and Hour Division. ""These business practices are not a legal way to reduce labor costs."" Sherborn and D'Ann's have agreed to put the employees back on their payrolls, and to pay them the back wages and an equal amount in liquidated damages that they are owed under the FLSA. The Sherborn Inn agreed to pay $36,202 in back wages and an equal amount in liquidated damages for a total of $72,404 to 28 employees. D'Ann's agreed to pay $73,493 in back wages and an equal amount in liquidated damages for a total of $146,986 to 16 employees. ""Misclassification is a serious threat to both workers and employers who obey the law and are undercut when others use illegal practices,"" said George Ference, the Wage and Hour Division's northeast regional administrator. ""Employers who work hard to comply with the law should not be placed at a competitive disadvantage by those who don't. Requiring the payment of liquidated damages in addition to the back wages owed should help level the playing field for those restaurant owners in the Boston area who play by the rules."" The FLSA provides that employers who violate the law are, as a general rule, liable to employees for their back wages and an equal amount in liquidated damages. Liquidated damages are paid directly to the affected employees. In addressing the trend of misclassification, the Wage and Hour Division plans to coordinate with relevant state agencies responsible for enforcing state laws that address such violations and may also refer these types of cases to the Internal Revenue Service. During the course of these investigations, OMG refused to cooperate with authorities from the Wage and Hour Division's Boston District Office and denied them access to time and payroll records. The Labor Department served OMG with an administrative subpoena to compel disclosure of all records necessary to complete the federal investigation. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit confirmed the validity of the secretary of labor's subpoena authority, and held OMG and its owner, Adilso Bosi, in contempt of court for failing to cooperate with the investigation. OMG and Bosi are incurring a $1,000 fine for each day they remain in contempt of the court's order.

"March 4, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20110304,Statement of Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis on February employment numbers,"WASHINGTON – Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis issued the following statement on the February 2011 Employment Situation report released today: ""Our nation's labor market improved notably in the month of February. Nonfarm payroll employment increased by 192,000, and the unemployment rate decreased to 8.9 percent – exceeding the consensus forecast and adding 60,000 workers to the labor market. Today's numbers highlight steady, sustained and widespread job growth. The bottom line: The policies and programs of this administration are working. ""There is no doubt that the economy we preside over today is better than it was two years ago. An economy that was once shrinking is now growing again. We've seen private sector job growth for 12 straight months – adding 1.5 million jobs. And the unemployment rate has dropped nine-tenths of a percent in the last three months – a drop we haven't seen since the early 1980s. I feel very good about where we're heading. ""But we know there's still more work to be done for the millions of people who are either out of work or struggling to offset their rising costs with shrinking paychecks. It's why President Obama championed a tax package on behalf of American families last year. And it's why in the last couple of months our recovery has picked up the pace. ""In his State of the Union address, President Obama discussed the need to out-innovate, out-educate and out-build our global competitors in order to win the future. ""The president knows we must also break down the barriers that stand in the way of the success of American business. He signed export deals with India and China. He has recently finalized a U.S.-Korea trade agreement with unprecedented support from business and labor, and since taking office has signed 17 tax cuts for small businesses into law. ""We face big challenges, and fixing them will require a lot of hard work and sacrifice from everyone. But if we're willing to come together and find common ground on these issues, then we can win the future. We can lay the foundation for American competiveness for years to come and give this generation, and pass on to the next, the type of America that our parents and grandparents left for us. ""While the employment situation is clearly improving, my mission remains the same: to create good and safe jobs for everyone. It is what the American people are counting on and a goal we will continue to keep at the forefront of everything we do."""

"March 3, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20110303,US Labor Department seeks debarment of construction contractor for labor violations at New York City publicly funded housing projects,"NEW YORK — The U.S. Department of Labor has taken legal action to seek debarment of Lettire Construction Corp., a New York City general contractor, and Nicholas Lettire, president of the company, from working on future federally funded contracts for a period of three years. An investigation by the Labor Department's Wage and Hour Division revealed that the company and its officials had willfully violated wage, benefit, certified payroll and other requirements while working on the federally funded Ciena Project on East 100th Street, as well as the Hobbs Court Project on 102nd Street, both in Manhattan. Both projects are part of the Metro North Rehabilitation Redevelopment Program and are funded in part by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Consequently, both projects are subject to the wage and benefit requirements of the Davis-Bacon Act and the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act. ""The department will not hesitate to pursue legal action, including debarment, to ensure employees working on federally funded projects are properly paid under the law,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. The investigation found that Lettire Construction had failed to adequately monitor its lower tier subcontractors to ensure their compliance with prevailing wage and overtime requirements. Following an investigation of 23 of the company's subcontractors, the Wage and Hour Division determined that 16 were in violation of either prevailing wage or overtime laws, or both. The investigation also found ""under-bidding"" by at least one second-tier subcontractor and that Lettire Construction failed to post required wage decisions at the worksite for employees to view. As a result of these violations, approximately 290 employees of these subcontractors were found to be due a total of about $1.4 million in back wages. In addition, the Wage and Hour Division's New York City District Office determined that Lettire Construction failed to pay required prevailing wage rates and fringe benefits to some of its employees, failed to pay some employees for all hours worked, and submitted certified payrolls that failed to reflect all actual hours worked by employees on the project during some weeks. The company has now agreed to pay $3,071 in back wages to four employees. In filing an order of reference with the Labor Department's Office of Administrative Law Judges, the department is seeking the debarment of Lettire Construction and company president Nicholas Lettire to prevent them from bidding or working on future federally funded contracts for a period of three years. The Davis-Bacon Act requires all contractors and subcontractors performing work on federal and certain federally funded projects to pay their laborers and mechanics the proper prevailing wage rates and fringe benefits as determined by the secretary of labor. In addition, the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act requires contractors and subcontractors to pay laborers and mechanics one and one-half times their basic rate of pay for all hours worked over 40 in a week. For more information on Davis-Bacon and other federal laws administered by the Wage and Hour Division, call the division's toll-free helpline at 866-4US-WAGE (487-9243).

The grant will provide retraining and re-employment services to dislocated workers as well as military spouses. ""Civilian defense workers and military spouses are important players in maintaining the security of our nation,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis.

Awarded to the Texas Workforce Commission, this grant will be operated by the Alamo Workforce Development Board, Central Texas Workforce Development Board, North East Texas Workforce Development Board and Upper Rio Grande Workforce Development Board. Realignments at the affected military installations covered under this grant began in 2007 and will continue through Sept. 15, 2011. Of the $6,116,896 announced today, $3,058,530 will be released initially. Additional funding up to the amount approved will be made available as the state demonstrates a continued need for assistance.

Funds will be shared among 31 programs that prepare out-of-school youth across the United States for careers through hands-on construction training, and high school completion and General Educational Development programs. ""YouthBuild is a triple win for the young people who participate in the program, the local communities that benefit from their efforts and our nation as a whole,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""YouthBuild helps young people who might otherwise slip through the cracks gain the educational and occupational skills that are necessary for a successful future. At the same time, these youngsters make valuable contributions to their neighborhoods through community service projects and the construction or renovation of affordable housing."" The Labor Department has administered YouthBuild since 2006, awarding its first grants in 2007. In that time, more than 13,000 young people have participated in programs in 44 states and the District of Columbia. YouthBuild participants include individuals who have been in the juvenile justice system, youth aging out of foster care, high school dropouts and others. In addition to receiving academic and occupational skills training, young people develop leadership skills and participate in community service opportunities. The Labor Department held a competition for applications in fall 2010. Today's grants are drawn from fiscal year 2010 funds reserved for organizations that did not receive funding in the fiscal year 2009 YouthBuild competition.

The Labor Department's Wage and Hour Division, through a strategic enforcement initiative aimed at curbing violations in an industry found to have a high rate of non-compliance with child labor laws, discovered approximately 160 minors were being required to perform hazardous jobs — such as operating paper balers and trash compactors, operating motor vehicles, using power driven mixers and baking — in theatres owned by the three chains. Marcus Theatre Corp. also allowed youth to work beyond permitted hours. The 27 theatres where the minors were employed are in nine states: California, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, South Carolina and Wisconsin. ""The penalties imposed as a result of these violations should serve as a wake-up call to movie theatre owners and other employers,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""Businesses that employ minors are legally and ethically obligated to abide by child labor standards and ensure youth are protected on the job."" In addition to paying civil money penalties, the companies agreed to implement comprehensive internal compliance and training programs. They also will assist the Wage and Hour Division in promoting industry-wide compliance. For example, Regal Cinemas is showing a child labor public service announcement on workplace safety at all 458 of its digital cinema locations in 39 states. Wage and Hour Division investigators determined that Knoxville, Tenn.-based Regal Cinemas Inc., which operates Regal Cinemas, Edwards Theatres and United Artist Theatres, violated child labor laws by employing minors to load and operate trash compactors. Regal Cinemas has paid $158,400 in civil money penalties. Investigators determined that Milwaukee, Wis.-based Marcus Theatres Corp. violated child labor laws by employing minors to load and operate trash compactors, operate motor vehicles and operate a dough mixer. The company also employed minors under the age of 16 to perform baking and allowed them to work beyond hours permitted under the FLSA. Marcus Theatres has paid $93,995 in civil money penalties. Investigators also determined that St. Louis, Mo.-based Wehrenberg Inc. allowed minors to load and operate trash compactors, and to operate motor vehicles. The company has paid $25,080 in penalties. The FLSA identifies 17 hazardous occupations prohibited for workers under the age of 18, which include operating and unloading scrap paper balers and paper box compactors. Loading is permitted only if certain specific conditions are met. There are also hours, times and occupation restrictions for employees under age 16. Fourteen- and 15-year-olds may work in certain occupations outside school hours, but not before 7 a.m. or later than 7 p.m., or 9 p.m. from June 1 until Labor Day. They may not work more than three hours on a school day and 18 hours in a school week, or eight hours on a non-school day and 40 hours in a week when school is not in session.

The EEOICPA provides compensation and medical benefits to workers who became ill as a result of working in the nuclear weapons industry. Survivors of qualified workers may also be entitled to benefits. A worker who is included in a designated SEC class of employees, and who is diagnosed with one of 22 specified cancers, may receive a presumption of causation under the EEOICPA. On Jan. 6, 2011, the secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services designated the following class of employees as an addition to the SEC: all employees who worked at the Simonds Saw and Steel Co., an Atomic Weapons Employer, in Lockport from Jan. 1, 1948, through Dec. 31, 1957, for at least 250 workdays occurring either solely under this employment or in combination with workdays within other classes of employees in the SEC. This designation became effective on Feb. 5. The Labor Department's role is to adjudicate these claims based on the new SEC class definitions as determined and introduced by HHS. To date, more than $10.4 million in compensation and medical benefits has been paid to 116 eligible Simonds Saw and Steel Co. claimants under the EEOICPA, while more than $6.7 billion in compensation and medical benefits has been paid nationwide.

""When parties refuse to comply with lawfully issued subpoenas, the Labor Department will use all available enforcement tools, including litigation, to require production of necessary records and testimony. The department is committed to bringing violators into compliance and leveling the playing field, so that law-abiding employers are not placed at a competitive disadvantage for playing by the rules and paying their workers full and fair wages."" The Fair Labor Standards Act authorizes the secretary of labor to investigate and gather data regarding wages, hours, and other conditions and practices of employment, and to issue subpoenas for the production of documents relating to any matter under investigation. During the course of the Wage and Hour Division's investigation, OMG refused to cooperate and denied investigators access to time and payroll records, as required under the FLSA. In response, the department served OMG with an administrative subpoena to compel disclosure of all records necessary to complete the federal investigation. When OMG continued to deny access to records, the department's Office of the Solicitor obtained a judgment from the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts ordering OMG to comply with the department's subpoena and levying a fine of $1,000 per day for each day of noncompliance with the subpoena. To date, fines against OMG and Bosi have accrued to more than $340,000. The FLSA requires that covered employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 for all hours worked, plus time and one-half their regular hourly rates of pay, including commissions, bonuses and incentive pay, for hours worked beyond 40 per week.

Solis today announced a solicitation for grant applications for the national Career Pathways Innovation Fund Grant Program. Over the next year, the department will award approximately $122 million through this program, including $65 million for health care-focused projects, and intends to fund 40 to 50 grants ranging from $1 million to $5 million each. These grants – which are replacing the former Community-Based Job Training grants – will focus on career pathway programs that help individuals of varying skill levels enter and pursue rewarding careers in emerging industries and in-demand occupations. ""Those who are looking for work – including the long-term unemployed – deserve access to the kind of training that will help them secure full-time employment in the 21st century economy,"" said Secretary Solis. ""Career pathway programs help get Americans back to work by ensuring that individuals of varying skill levels can earn credentials that are highly valued by employers. That is the right thing to do for the unemployed and the smart thing to do for the nation."" Programs funded through these grants will have multiple entry and exit points, and many will include links to services such as basic adult education and English for speakers of other languages classes that make them accessible to individuals who are not yet prepared to enroll in college courses. The grants, which will be made to community colleges and other organizations, support President Obama s broader agenda of helping every American gain at least one year of postsecondary education, and will help reach his goal of America having the highest proportion of college graduates in the world by 2020. The Career Pathways Innovation Fund grants will emphasize career pathway programs implemented by community colleges in partnership with employers, local workforce investment boards, and community and faith-based organizations. In order to further the goals of career training and education, and encourage innovation in the development of new learning materials leading to industry-recognized credentials, grantees will be required to license to the public (not including the federal government) all work created with the support of their grants.

The settlement follows an investigation by the U.S. Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, which found that 103 black, 28 Asian and 20 Hispanic job applicants were systemically rejected for sales associate positions at the company's Chicago offices in 2006 and 2007. In addition to financial compensation, InterCall will extend a total of 14 offers of employment to affected applicants as positions become available. ""I'm pleased that we were able to work out a fair resolution on this case,"" said OFCCP Midwest Regional Director Sandra S. Zeigler. ""Companies that do business with our government have a responsibility to ensure that their workplaces are safe, fair and diverse. Going forward, we expect that will be true at InterCall."" During a scheduled compliance review, OFCCP determined that the company had violated Executive Order 11246, which prohibits federal contractors and subcontractors from discriminating on the basis of race and national origin in their employment practices. Under the terms of the conciliation agreement worked out between the Labor Department and InterCall, the company will pay $700,000 to be divided among the 151 affected minority applicants who return timely notifications. The company also has agreed to undertake extensive self-monitoring and corrective measures to ensure that all employment practices fully comply with the law and will immediately correct any discriminatory practices. InterCall, a subsidiary of West Corp. of Omaha, Neb., is the world's largest conferencing provider. Between 2005 and 2008, the company had a $1.7 million contract to provide software, telecommunication support and recording services to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. In addition to Executive Order 11246, OFCCP's legal authority exists under Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974. As amended, these three laws hold those who do business with the federal government, both contractors and subcontractors, to the fair and reasonable standard that they not discriminate in employment on the basis of gender, race, color, religion, national origin, disability or status as a protected veteran.

"February 28, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20110228,US Labor Department obtains court judgment against executive of Oklahoma aircraft manufacturer for misuse of employee benefit plan premiums,"ALTUS, Okla. – The U.S. Department of Labor has obtained a consent judgment and order permanently barring the owner of defunct Quartz Mountain Aerospace Inc., which operated in Altus as well as in Coffeeville, Kan., from serving in a fiduciary capacity to any employee benefit plan unless he obtains fiduciary training by Jan. 31, 2012. Under the judgment, owner Mark A. Arciero must obtain at least 12 hours of training on the duties of fiduciaries and trustees to plans governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. He also must provide proof to the Labor Department that he has completed this fiduciary training with a nationally recognized organization. Additionally, he is enjoined from committing further ERISA violations. The judgment was entered in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma-Oklahoma City Division. The department sued Arciero for allegedly failing to remit employee premiums to the plan for the period of Aug. 8, 2008, through Nov. 15, 2008, to segregate plan assets from those of the company, and to hold those assets in trust as required by ERISA. “Corporate executives have a duty to properly manage plans in a way that benefits employees. Our legal action removes the defendant from oversight of plans unless he obtains appropriate fiduciary training,” said Roger Hilburn, director of the Dallas Regional Office of the Labor Department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration. “This case demonstrates our commitment to take legal action to protect the hard-earned benefits of workers.” Quartz Mountain Aerospace sponsored the welfare plan to provide health, dental, short-term disability and life insurance coverage for its employees. The company filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy on Oct. 29, 2009. There were 87 participants whose premiums were not forwarded to the plan’s insurance carriers. This case is part of EBSA’s national enforcement initiative to safeguard workers’ contributions to 401(k) and health benefit plans. The department’s legal action resulted from an investigation by EBSA’s Dallas Regional Office and was litigated by the department’s regional solicitor in Dallas. Employers and workers can reach EBSA’s Dallas office at 972-850-4500 or toll-free at 866-444-3272 for help with problems relating to private sector retirement and health plans.

Funds also will be used to upgrade the state's existing benefit payment system. ""Being without health care coverage can be one of the most stressful aspects of losing one's job,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis.

The grant, awarded to the New Hampshire Department of Resources and Economic Development, will be used to provide ""gap filler"" payments for unemployed individuals who are receiving Trade Adjustment Assistance benefits and are eligible for the Health Coverage Tax Credit program. Under the program, eligible individuals can receive 80 percent of premium costs for qualified health insurance programs. The payments provided through this grant cover the gap period, that is, the time it takes to complete Internal Revenue Service enrollment, processing and first payments under the HCTC program.

"February 24, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20110224-0,"US Labor Department lawsuit recovers $780,000 in back wages and liquidated damages for 40 employees of Long Island, NY, pizzeria","WESTBURY, N.Y. — The U.S. Department of Labor has recovered $780,000 in back wages and liquidated damages for 40 employees of Martino's Pizzeria Inc., doing business as Mama's Pizzeria and Restaurant, in Copiague, N.Y., resolving a lawsuit filed against the company for violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act. The court's judgment prohibits the company and owners Gaetano and Grace Pinello from future violations of the FLSA; orders the immediate payment of $390,000 in minimum wage and overtime back wages, and another $390,000 in liquidated damages; and requires an additional $20,000 in civil money penalties be paid to the government for willful violations of the law. ""When employers take advantage of workers who may not know their rights, the Labor Department will step in,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""This case is significant because 40 people who worked hard for low wages they did not receive finally will be paid. Businesses need to understand that doing right by their employees should be their priority, as it is ours."" An investigation by the department's Wage and Hour Division Long Island District Office in Westbury, N.Y., found that several restaurant employees were required to work 70 to 80 hours in many weeks without overtime compensation and were paid less than the federal minimum wage for all hours worked. The defendants paid their employees partly in cash off the books, and kept no time or payroll records indicating their employees' work hours, tips, wages and other conditions of employment, as required by the FLSA. ""Our experience has shown that many full service pizza/pasta restaurants on Long Island are willfully underpaying their employees,"" said Irv Miljoner, director of the division's Long Island District Office. ""That was the case here. We are targeting similar employers in this industry for enforcement actions."" The FLSA requires that covered employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, as well as one and one-half times their regular hourly rates for every hour they work beyond 40 per week. Employers who violate these provisions are liable to their workers for the full amount of unpaid wages and an equal amount in liquidated damages. The law also requires employers to maintain accurate records of employees' wages, hours and other conditions of employment, and prohibits employers from retaliating against employees who exercise their rights under the law. The Labor Department's suit was filed by its New York Regional Solicitor's Office with the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. As part of the judgment, the defendants are ordered to abide by a compliance plan requiring them to keep accurate records of the hours worked by their employees and prohibiting them from making improper deductions from employees' wages. The plan also requires the defendants to ensure that all managers and employees are properly trained with regard to their respective rights and responsibilities under the FLSA. Training must be provided in both English and Spanish. Additionally, employees must be given copies of the following documents in their choice of English or Spanish: a copy of the compliance plan, the Labor Department flyer ""Employee Rights Under the Fair Labor Standards Act"" and the Labor Department's ""Fact Sheet #23: Overtime Pay Requirements of the FLSA."" These are to be provided to existing employees at the time of the required training and to new employees when they are hired. The defendants also must display the poster in English and Spanish in conspicuous places throughout their establishments for their employees to view.

"February 24, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20110224,"US Labor Department collects $2 million in back wages, civil money penalties from Houston-based Hong Kong Market grocery chain","HOUSTON — The U.S. Department of Labor has recovered $1.8 million in back wages for nearly 400 workers and collected $200,000 in civil money penalties from Houston-based grocery stores Hong Land Corp., Hong Kong Group Inc., Pacific Ocean Enterprise Inc. and B&B Corner Corp., all doing business as Hong Kong Market, and store owners Hai Du Duong and Ha Duong. A consent judgment resolves a lawsuit filed by the department charging the defendants with violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act. They have been ordered to pay a total of $1.8 million in minimum wage and overtime back wages. In addition, they paid $200,000 in civil money penalties for repeat and willful violations of the FLSA. ""These employers disregarded our nation's most basic labor laws. They exploited the vulnerability of hundreds of low-wage workers, and then deliberately misled investigators to try to keep them from finding out the truth,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""The Labor Department will use all enforcement tools available, including litigation and penalties. We will secure full and fair compensation for affected workers, and we will level the playing field for businesses that follow the rules."" An investigation by the department's Wage and Hour Division revealed that the defendants had committed several violations of the FLSA's minimum wage, overtime pay and recordkeeping provisions, including falsifying payroll records and coercing vulnerable workers to return wages earned. The investigation disclosed that employees worked as many as 70 hours a week, but were paid less than the minimum wage and denied overtime compensation due for hours worked over 40 per week. In addition to the back wages, the defendants paid civil money penalties because they continued to violate the FLSA after being put on notice of similar violations in a prior investigation. The consent judgment required immediate payment of the back wages and enjoins the defendants from further violations of the FLSA, which requires that covered employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 for all hours worked, plus time and one-half their regular rates of pay, including commissions, bonuses and incentive pay, for hours worked beyond 40 per week. The act also requires employers to maintain accurate time and payroll records.

Through this competition, the department will award approximately $40 million to support five to eight grantees with awards ranging from $5 million to $8 million each. Eligible applicants will include national and statewide organizations with local affiliates that have existing career training programs and will benefit a minimum of six communities per grant. ""This grant program is an important effort in supporting green investments and equipping workers with the knowledge, skills and abilities they need to succeed in green occupations,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""The projects we expect to fund will enable workers to gain new skills that will make them competitive for industries and careers in demand."" These funds will enable training providers to develop programs that incorporate green career pathways by forging linkages between Registered Apprenticeship and pre-apprenticeship programs, and/or integrating the delivery of technical and basic skills training through community-based partnerships. The grants are tied to the Labor Department's vision of increasing the number of individuals completing training programs with industry-recognized credentials and increasing the number of individuals completing training programs for employment in green jobs.

"February 23, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/vets/vets20110223,New rule aimed at improving employment services for veterans proposed by US Department of Labor,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor's Veterans' Employment and Training Service, known as VETS, has proposed a rule establishing a uniform national threshold performance level to be applied to state grantees that provide employment services to veterans. The national threshold applies to those state grantees responsible for serving veterans under both the Wagner-Peyser State Grants administered by the Labor Department's Employment and Training Administration and the Jobs for Veterans State Grants administered by VETS. The draft rule specifies that the national threshold will apply to ""state employment service delivery systems"" funded by the two-state grant programs but not the employment services provided through state and local agency grants under the Workforce Investment Act. To determine whether any of the state employment service delivery systems are deficient in their services to veterans, the proposed rule will apply the national threshold as part of a two-step process. The first step will identify those state agencies whose performance on behalf of veterans is to undergo further review. As the second step, the department will conduct a comprehensive review of the operations and outcomes of those state agencies whose performance falls below the national threshold, taking into account economic conditions and other key factors that vary by state. If the review determines that the performance of a state grantee is deficient, the draft rule requires that the state grantee prepare a corrective action plan, with technical assistance provided by VETS. The corrective action plan then will be submitted to the department for approval. The proposed rule, published in the Federal Register , allows 60 days for public comments, which are due no later than April 19, 2011. The notice can be accessed at http://s.dol.gov/D6."

The additional locations of the plans are Beth Park and Ford City, Pa.; South Plainfield, N.J.; Waltham, Mass.; Anderson, Ind.; Saco, Maine; and Orange Beach, Ala. Rhonda Sue Irvin Cox, owner of Irvin Administrative Solutions LLC, embezzled the assets from the plans between January 2003 and April 2007 while serving as their administrator.

""Challenges and Solutions for Hourly Workers"" is part of the Women's Bureau's National Dialogue on Workplace Flexibility, a series of events building on the goals of the March 2010 White House Flexibility Forum. ""Flexible workplace polices are good for employees, and they are also good for a company's bottom line,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""The Labor Department is committed to helping all Americans balance their work and home responsibilities, and to exploring solutions to challenges faced by both employers and employees. Today's dialogue is a step forward in matching workplace policies with realities of the 21st century workforce."" Secretary Solis delivered the keynote and introduced First Lady Michelle Obama's video message on ""changing workplaces."" Women's Bureau Director Sara Manzano-Diaz gave welcoming remarks. KTLA-TV reporter and anchor Elizabeth Espinosa moderated the panel discussion, which included Joan Williams, founder and director, University of California-Hastings' Center for Worklife Law; Jennifer Piallat, owner, Zazie Restaurant; Rosalind Hudnell, chief diversity officer and global director of education and external relations, Intel; Barbara Grimm, senior vice president, labor management partnership, Kaiser Permanente; and Marianne Giordano, president, Office and Professional Employees International Union Local 30. Closing remarks were provided by Maria Elena Durazo, executive secretary-treasurer, Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, AFL-CIO. As reported by the president's Council of Economic Advisers, changes in American society have increased the need for flexibility in the workplace, including a larger number of women entering the labor force, the prevalence of families in which all adults work, increasing elder care responsibilities and the rising importance of continuing education. Hourly workers face the same work-life issues as those faced by professional employees, but not having access to flexible policies can have more devastating effects on their employment status. ""Flexibility is not just a women's issue, it is a family issue,"" said Manzano-Diaz. ""Women now serve as the primary or co-breadwinners in two-thirds of American households. When employees are able to balance the needs of both work and home, it not only impacts productivity but strengthens families and communities."" The Women's Bureau, established by Congress in 1920, is the only federal agency designated to represent the needs of working women. Today, the bureau's goal is to empower all working women to achieve economic security by preparing them for well-paying jobs, ensuring fair compensation, promoting workplace flexibility and helping homeless women veterans reintegrate into the workforce."

"February 16, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20110216,MSHA creates additional district office to oversee southern West Virginia coal mines,"ARLINGTON, Va. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration today announced that federal inspectors issued 377 citations and orders during special impact inspections conducted at 15 coal and seven metal/nonmetal mine operations last month. The coal mines were issued 208 citations and seven orders; the metal/nonmetal mines were issued 148 citations and 14 orders. These inspections, which began in force last April following the explosion at Upper Big Branch Mine, involve mines that merit increased agency attention and enforcement due to their poor compliance history or particular compliance concerns, including high numbers of violations or closure orders; indications of operator tactics, such as advance notification of inspections that prevent inspectors from observing violations; frequent hazard complaints or hotline calls; plan compliance issues; inadequate workplace examinations; a high number of accidents, injuries or illnesses; fatalities; and adverse conditions such as increased methane liberation, faulty roof conditions and inadequate ventilation. ""Some mine operators have begun to show signs of improvement, while others continue to demonstrate poor compliance with safety and health laws,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. On Jan. 14, an inspection party arrived at Manalapan Mining Co. Inc.'s RB No. 12 Mine in Harlan County, Ky., during the evening shift. The inspectors captured and monitored the phones after production had started to prevent advance notification of their arrival. They issued 24 104(a) citations and three 104(d)(2) orders, the majority of which are related to not examining and maintaining electrical equipment. Such violations may create electrical hazards and potentially expose miners to electrocution. Other violations included accumulations of combustible materials inside a power center and one along a conveyor belt, which could lead to an explosion. Inspectors also found unsafe rib and roof conditions, which could result in a roof fall. MSHA found three defective and one properly operating handheld multi-gas detectors. One 104(d)(2) order was issued when one of the mine's pre-shift examiners was encountered in an outby area with his handheld multi-gas detector turned off. When turned on, it was found to be defective. Further investigation revealed the detector had not been calibrated for almost two months. This condition resulted in another 104(d)(2) order, since handheld detectors are required to be calibrated every 31 days. Two other handheld detectors were turned off and had dead batteries. Inoperable, non-calibrated and defective multi-gas detectors increase the risk that explosive mixtures of methane or low oxygen could go undetected, resulting in a mine explosion or unsafe levels of oxygen in the air. A 104(d)(2) order was issued on a front-end loader operated on the surface for allowing combustible materials to accumulate on the engine, exhaust system and other parts. Beginning Jan. 19, MSHA inspectors conducted an impact inspection at the Queenstake Resources USA's Jerritt Canyon Mill in Elko County, Nev. They issued 24 citations and seven 104(d)(2) orders. Two of the 104(d)(2) orders were issued in conjunction with a 107(a) imminent danger order. One 104(d)(2) order was issued for the operator's failure to examine each working place at least once per shift for conditions that may adversely affect safety or health. A second 104(d)(2) order was issued in conjunction with a 107(a) order, for operating equipment that posed hazards to miners. A 107(a) order was issued in a lab in which inspectors detected a strong, irritating odor and white mist/vapors coming off a heated tray inside a ventilation hood. A sample was taken immediately, indicating that nitric acid potential exposure was above the established short-term exposure limit. The health risks from overexposure include severe lung damage, such as pulmonary edema. Since April 2010, MSHA has conducted 220 impact inspections. These inspections have resulted in 4,114 citations, 384 orders and 13 safeguards.

"February 16, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ilab/ilab20110216,US Department of Labor presents Iqbal Masih Award to Liberian workers group for efforts to combat exploitive child labor,"WASHINGTON — Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis today announced that the U.S. Department of Labor has presented the 2010 Iqbal Masih Award for the Elimination of Child Labor to the Firestone Agricultural Workers Union of Liberia. ""This award recognizes the extraordinary efforts of the Firestone Agricultural Workers Union to combat the worst forms of child labor internationally,"" said Secretary Solis. ""The group serves as a model to others, showing that progress is possible and worth the effort."" The Iqbal Masih Award was established by Congress to recognize the work of an individual, company, organization or national government to end the worst forms of child labor. The award reflects the spirit of Iqbal Masih, a Pakistani child enslaved at the age of four who escaped his servitude and became an outspoken advocate against child slavery. Tragically, in 1995 at the age of 13, Iqbal was killed in Pakistan. In 2010, the Labor Department's Bureau of International Labor Affairs published a notice in the Federal Register soliciting public nominations for the award. The International Labor Rights Forum nominated the Firestone Agricultural Workers Union for successfully negotiating collective bargaining agreements with the Firestone Plantation in 2008 and 2010 that banned child labor while also improving the wages and working conditions of plantation workers. Since 1995, the Labor Department has supported efforts to combat exploitive child labor internationally. For more information, visit http://www.dol.gov/ilab ."
"February 15, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20110215,MSHA creates additional district office to oversee southern West Virginia coal mines,"ARLINGTON, Va. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration today announced that it will split the agency's jurisdiction over southern West Virginia coal mines into two separate districts, a process that will begin in the second quarter of fiscal year 2011. Of the nation's 2,100 coal mines, approximately 400 fall within the existing District 4 boundaries. The District 4 office, located in Mt. Hope, W.Va., currently has the most employees of all MSHA's 11 coal districts, as well as the most extensive workload with the smallest ratio of managers and supervisors to line staff. It is responsible for 27 percent of all mechanized mining units in the nation, compared to 14 percent in the next closest district. In FY 2009, District 4 issued 23,282 citations, 47 percent more than the next most active district in the nation. A new District 12 Office will be located in Pineville, W.Va., and staffed by positions reallocated from District 4 and other districts. The new district manager, once hired, will create an organizational structure similar to other districts that are comparable in size. ""Resources must be reallocated to allow MSHA's coal division to effectively carry out its mission, including new administration initiatives designed to strengthen health and safety protections for the nation's miners,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""MSHA is committed to implementing management reforms that will increase the agency's efficiency and effectiveness within a significantly constrained budget framework."" Costs associated with setting up the new office are estimated at $491,000. Annual rental costs are estimated at $634,000. These above-base funds are included in the president's FY 2012 budget request. Although coal production is declining in some districts, the increase in production of southern West Virginia coal, with its high carbon and low sulfur content, appears to be a long-term trend."
"February 15, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20110215,Statement from assistant secretary of labor for OSHA supporting promotion of job creation,"Agency doing everything possible to support good, safe jobs WASHINGTON – Dr. David Michaels, assistant secretary of labor for the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration, today issued the following statement as the Subcommittee on Workforce Protections of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce holds a hearing on ""Investigating OSHA's Regulatory Agenda and Its Impact on Job Creation."" Michaels understands the committee's interest in examining the relationship between OSHA's regulatory agenda and job creation. The Labor Department is focused on doing everything possible to support the creation of good, safe jobs. ""I think we can all agree that the American economy must succeed but never at the cost of the safety or health of American workers. OSHA's goal is to ensure that everyone who goes to work returns home safely. I think we can also agree that the size of a business should not determine the level of protection that a worker receives. All workers have the same right to a safe workplace. ""Despite concerns about the effect of regulation on American business, there is clear evidence that OSHA's commonsense regulations have made working conditions in this country today far safer than 40 years ago when the agency was created, while at the same time protecting American jobs. The truth is that OSHA standards don't kill jobs. They stop jobs from killing workers. OSHA standards don't just prevent worker injuries and illnesses. They also drive technological innovation, making industries more competitive. ""Many OSHA standards cost little and easily can be adopted by employers with nominal effect on the bottom line. OSHA, by law and by practice, always looks at both the overall cost of compliance with a proposed regulation and at the expected benefits. The evidence shows that OSHA generally overestimates the cost of its standards. Congress' Office of Technology Assessment, comparing the predicted and actual costs of eight OSHA regulations, found that in almost all cases 'industries that were most affected achieved compliance straightforwardly, and largely avoided the destructive economic effects' that they feared. Standards intended to protect workers from cancer-causing chemicals such as vinyl chloride and ethylene oxide were shown to not only protect workers but also to increase productivity. OSHA's trenching standard has significantly cut the death rate for construction workers, and OSHA's bloodborne pathogens standard has almost eliminated work-related cases of hepatitis B and HIV. ""The failure to issue sensible regulations endangers not only workers' health and safety but also hurts American competitiveness. For example, because OSHA has a weak noise standard and weak enforcement, U.S. employers have no incentive to buy modern, quieter machines, which means that U.S. manufacturers don't build them, and there are few jobs in the U.S. for engineers who could design them. A recent study by the National Academy of Engineering concludes that European manufacturers are way ahead of us in designing and building modern, quieter machinery. Today, when businesses anywhere in the world want to buy quieter equipment, they look not to the United States but to Europe. ""As we approach OSHA's 40th anniversary, the agency's success has been well documented. An estimated 14,000 workers were killed on the job the year that Congress created OSHA. That number had fallen to approximately 4,340 in 2009. At the same time, U.S. employment has almost doubled and now includes more than 130 million workers at more than 7.2 million worksites. Since the passage of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the rate of reported serious workplace injuries and illnesses has declined from 11 per 100 workers in 1972 to 3.9 per 100 workers in 2008. ""But OSHA's job isn't over. More than 3 million workers in America are injured every year. Every day 12 workers die on the job. OSHA's commonsense regulations are helping to drive these numbers down and, at the same time, helping American businesses modernize and compete in the global economy."""
"February 14, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20110214,US Department of Labor releases fiscal year 2012 budget request,"Budget reflects fiscal responsibility while investing in job training and worker protection WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor today outlined its part of the president's fiscal year 2012 budget request to Congress. The department's budget request focuses on efficiently achieving the department's goals while exercising fiscal restraint. ""Our budget request reflects our commitment to help America 'win the future' by sustaining a competitive workforce and ensuring worker protections,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""Our fiscal year 2012 request reflects what it will take to keep America's workforce strong and innovative. It also makes responsible and reasonable cuts that are rooted in current economic realities and a continued focus on increased efficiency and effectiveness."" The department's budget request totals $12.8 billion in discretionary funding. The budget aims to help Americans find and keep jobs through programs that provide training and employment opportunities for unemployed adults, dislocated workers and vulnerable communities. The budget also preserves support for employment and training programs that target Native American communities and migrant and seasonal farmworkers, as well as YouthBuild and Job Corps, which serve disadvantaged youth. The department will continue to support veterans by investing an additional $2 million in the Transition Assistance Program and an additional $3 million in the Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program. In this time of tough economic conditions, job training programs need to be as efficient and effective as possible. In order to test new ideas and replicate proven strategies to deliver comprehensive and cost-effective services that help individuals acquire skills and succeed in employment, the 2012 budget will reinvest funding previously allocated to the states in order to establish a Workforce Innovation Fund. The budget proposes almost $380 million for the fund in the U.S. Departments of Labor and Education, which will jointly oversee competitive grants to support innovative, systemic and evidence-based reforms in the workforce system. The 2012 budget reflects many difficult choices. It reduces the Community Service Employment for Older Americans program and transfers the program to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, where it can be better coordinated with other safety-net programs for seniors. In addition, the budget eliminates the $125 million Career Pathways Innovation Fund, which duplicates the recently enacted Trade Adjustment Assistance Community College and Career Training Program, and reduces funding for Job Corps construction to cover higher operations costs. The department will continue its commitment to enhancing worker safety. For example, to improve mine safety in 2012, the department is requesting $33 million to help reduce the large case backlog at the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission. The current backlog creates an unacceptable delay in holding bad-actor operators accountable for threatening the health and safety of America's miners. The budget proposes to strengthen the defined benefit pension system for the millions of Americans who rely on it by giving the board of directors of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. the authority to adjust the premiums it charges pension plan sponsors. Increases will be phased in gradually, starting in 2014, and PBGC will be directed to take into account the risks that different sponsors pose to their retirees and to the pension insurance program. In 2012, the department will continue to protect workers and level the playing field for businesses by investing almost $50 million to combat worker misclassification involving the Wage and Hour Division, the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Office of the Solicitor, and the Employment and Training Administration. When workers are misclassified as independent contractors, they are deprived of benefits and protections to which they are legally entitled, and law-abiding businesses are placed at a disadvantage against employers who violate the law. Additionally, the department's FY 2012 budget request promotes a continuation of efforts to ensure program effectiveness, improve efficiency and increase transparency. The department will invest $30 million in program evaluations to be overseen by the chief evaluation officer. The budget includes a request for an Office of Information Services that will centralize and speed up responses to Freedom of Information Act requests.

""I am pleased that with the support of today's national emergency grant, workers across the Bluegrass State will have the opportunity to pursue the employment and training activities they need to access good jobs in growing industries.""

The purpose of these grants is to provide an employment-centered approach to reintegration that improves long-term labor market prospects for ex-offenders. ""The Labor Department is committed to getting all Americans back to work and to expanding opportunities for everyone who wants a job,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""Stable employment helps ex-offenders stay out of the legal system. Focusing on that end is the right thing to do for these individuals, and it makes sense for local communities and our economy as a whole."" Authorized by the Workforce Investment Act, today's grants will be awarded through a competitive process open to nonprofit, faith-based and community organizations. Participants will be individuals ages 18 and older who have been convicted as adults under federal or state law, but who have never been convicted of a sex-related offense, with the exception of prostitution. Complete eligibility criteria are included in the solicitation for grant applications. In order to successfully reintegrate into a community, it is essential that ex-offenders possess the skills and support necessary to enter and compete for jobs in the labor market. This grant will rely heavily on faith-based and community organizations to develop necessary relationships and facilitate connections to rehabilitation services for program participants. Each year approximately 650,000 inmates are released from state and federal prisons, and return to their communities and families. Without assistance to make a successful transition, the majority of ex-offenders return to criminal activity. Almost three out of five returning ex-offenders will be charged with new crimes within three years of their release from prison, and two out of five will be re-incarcerated, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.

""2010 will be remembered for the dramatic explosion that killed 29 men at the Upper Big Branch Mine and for the deaths of 42 other miners across the nation whose lives ended in needless tragedy,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""We can and must honor all of these miners by increasing our efforts to ensure safe and healthy workplaces for our nation's miners."" Of the 71 deaths in 2010, 48 occurred in coal mines. Twenty-three occurred at metal and nonmetal operations, and nearly half of those victims were contractors. Excluding the 29 miners who died at Upper Big Branch, preliminary information indicates that more than half of the remaining 42 deaths involved violations of the ""Rules to Live By"" standards, found at http://www.msha.gov/focuson/RulestoLiveByII/RulestoLiveByII.asp , and represent the same causes of deaths that have occurred frequently over the past 10 years. ""We must all learn from these tragedies and act to prevent additional fatalities,"" said Main. ""Fatalities are not inevitable. They can be prevented using effective safety and health management programs, workplace examinations for hazards, and effective and appropriate training so that miners recognize and understand the hazards, and how to control or eliminate them."" MSHA has posted summary information on its website, http://www.msha.gov , identifying causes of the mining fatalities that occurred in 2010, best practices to prevent them, posters for mine operators to print and display in their organizations, and other information on preventing fatalities in mining workplaces. Fatal investigation reports, once completed, are also available at that site. Among the causes of death in last year's mining fatalities: Seven metal/nonmetal miners died in powered haulage accidents. Four surface coal mine truck drivers were killed in powered haulage accidents when they lost control of their trucks and either struck another truck, turned over the truck, or the truck went through a berm and over a highwall. Six coal miners were killed working in close proximity to mining or haulage equipment. Six coal miners and two metal/nonmetal miners were fatally crushed by roof falls and rib rolls. Six metal/nonmetal miners and two coal miners died when they were struck by falling material or moving objects."

"February 10, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20110210,US Labor Department sues Houston-based Kinder Morgan,"HOUSTON  The U.S. Department of Labor has announced the filing of a lawsuit against Houston-based Kinder Morgan Inc. and Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP for their failure to pay more than $1 million in overtime compensation to approximately 4,500 current and former operators, technicians, maintenance workers, laborers and administrative nonexempt employees in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act. The department's suit asks the court to order the defendants to pay the full amount of back wages due, along with liquated damages, and to prohibit them from violating the law in the future. Kinder Morgan Inc., owner of Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP, is one of the largest pipeline transportation and energy storage companies in North America, with an enterprise value of $30 billion and approximately 8,000 employees nationwide. The defendants provide services to local oil refineries and clients such as Conoco/Philips, Exxon Mobil and Shell. ""There is no excuse for denying workers their rightful wages, and this lawsuit demonstrates that the department will use all available enforcement tools, including litigation and penalties, to ensure accountability and compliance with the law,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. The complaint was filed against both companies in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, after an investigation by the Labor Department's Wage and Hour Division found systemic violations nationwide resulting from the employers' failure to include certain bonuses in overtime pay calculations for these employees. The FLSA requires that covered employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 for all hours worked, plus time and one-half their regular rates of pay, including commissions, bonuses and incentive pay, for hours worked beyond 40 per week. Employers must also maintain accurate time and payroll records. For more information about the FLSA and other federal wage laws, call the Wage and Hour Division's toll-free helpline at 866-4US-WAGE (487-9243) or the division's district office in Houston at 713-339-5500.

"February 9, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20110209,Statement by Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis on extending expanded Trade Adjustment Assistance program,"WASHINGTON – Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis today issued the following statement regarding the extension of the Trade Adjustment Assistance program as amended by the Trade and Globalization Adjustment Assistance Act of 2009: ""It is vital that Congress take action before this Saturday to extend the Recovery Act""s expansions to the Trade Adjustment Assistance program. These expansions to the TAA program have helped tens of thousands of trade-impacted workers get the job training, placement assistance and income support they need to succeed in a tough job market. On behalf of the workers whose livelihoods and families depend on this vital program, and every American who wants our country to compete and win in the changing global economy, I urge Congress to act before the end of this week. ""The Trade and Globalization Adjustment Assistance Act, which was part of the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act passed by Congress in 2009, strengthened the TAA program by extending coverage to workers in the service sector and providing them with enhanced benefit and service options. But those Recovery Act expansions will sunset on Feb. 12, 2011. ""Since the Recovery Act made these important changes to the TAA program, an estimated 400,000 workers have been certified to receive TAA services. Approximately 170,000 of these workers may not have been eligible without the Recovery Act's expansions. ""I have spoken with TAA participants during my travels throughout the country, and they have told me their first-hand accounts of the vital support this program provides. In fact, I was in Michigan and Ohio earlier this week – states where workers know what an essential lifeline TAA can be. ""A long-term extension of the expanded program would help many who are facing layoffs and seeking re-employment in a persistently challenging job market. I urge Congress to find a prompt and bipartisan solution to extending this vital program. ""Last December, Congress unanimously passed a paid-for extension of the expanded TAA program. The administration supported that bipartisan measure and I stand ready and willing to work closely with Congress to quickly get a long-term extension enacted. ""Americans are rightly counting on their congressional leaders to help trade-impacted workers whose well-being should not be treated as a partisan issue."""

Projects funded through these grants will help juvenile offenders gain valuable jobs skills, and participants will demonstrate accountability for their actions through community service. ""Some young people stray from the paths of career, family and community, but that need not dictate the rest of their lives,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""Connecting young offenders with opportunities to acquire solid job skills is a crucial step toward ensuring their long term economic self-sufficiency and allows them to take a positive role in our society."" Awarded through a competitive process, the grants will prepare participants for employment and reduce recidivism. These goals will be accomplished through on-the-job training, job placement, subsidized jobs and service projects that allow young offenders to take a positive role in their communities. Participants will improve their skills, and enhance their future educational and career opportunities, through the work experiences, vocational training and academic interventions made possible by these grants. The department expects to award a minimum of 13 grants through this funding opportunity. Any nonprofit organization, unit of state or local government, and Indian or Native American entity eligible for grants under the Workforce Investment Act's Section 166 may apply for these grants. Full eligibility information for applicants and individual participants is included in the solicitation for grant applications. The solicitation is published in today's Federal Register and can be viewed online at http://www.doleta.gov/grants/find_grants.cfm .

"February 7, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20110207,US Labor Department and mine operator in Puerto Rico negotiate settlement in discrimination case,"Miner fired after cooperating in federal investigation is permanently reinstated ARLINGTON, Va. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration today announced that it has negotiated a settlement agreement with Comunidad Agricola Bianchi Inc. of San Juan, Puerto Rico, in a discrimination case involving a miner employed by the company's operation in Rincon, Puerto Rico. Jose A. Chaparro was fired from his job shortly after cooperating in an MSHA hazard complaint investigation at the mine. In August 2009, MSHA received an anonymous hazard complaint raising concerns about safety issues at the mine, including details about an unreported June 2009 accident at the mine involving Chaparro. As a result, MSHA launched a hazard complaint investigation. The same day that MSHA spoke with Chaparro about his accident, the mine superintendent fired him. In a complaint filed with the Mine Safety and Health Review Commission, MSHA sought a finding that Chaparro was unlawfully discriminated against and discharged in violation of Section 105(c)(1) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, which states that miners, their representatives and applicants for employment are protected from retaliation for engaging in safety and/or health-related activities, such as identifying hazards, asking for MSHA inspections or refusing to engage in an unsafe act. The complaint also sought Chaparro's reinstatement to his position or a comparable one, $6,000 in back pay, all employment benefits, all medical and hospital benefits, and any and all other damages suffered and incurred by Chaparro as a result of the discriminatory discharge, as well as a $15,000 civil money penalty. Following a hearing in February 2010, a judge ordered Chaparro temporarily reinstated to his job at the mine. In a second amended complaint, MSHA brought a claim of post-reinstatement retaliation against Comunidad Agricola Bianchi Inc. and three individual representatives of the mine. In settlement, the company agreed to permanently reinstate Chaparro to his job at the mine and to pay the full $6,000 in back wages due to Chaparro, as well as the full $15,000 penalty. The mine operator also agreed that it would not unlawfully discriminate against any miner in its employ for engaging in protected activity. ""The Mine Act is clear,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""Miners have a right to participate in an MSHA investigation, and they may not be fired, demoted, harassed, transferred, refused employment or suffer any loss of wages for exercising their right. Meanwhile, my department's Mine Safety and Health Administration will continue to vigorously investigate all discriminatory complaints.""

"February 7, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20110207,"US Labor Department recovers more than $934,000 in overtime back wages for 479 employees of UnitedHealthcare in Hartford, Conn.","HARTFORD, Conn. — The U.S. Department of Labor has recovered a total of $934,551 in overtime back wages for 479 employees of UnitedHealthcare and $104,280 in civil money penalties after an investigation by the department's Wage and Hour Division determined that the employees had been incorrectly classified as exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act and consequently denied compensation for all hours worked. UnitedHealthcare is the largest single health insurance carrier in the United States. This action is limited to the company's Hartford location, which specializes in the IT, finance, actuarial and underwriting operations for UnitedHealth Group Inc. ""Employers subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act's requirements, whether large or small, must ensure all of their workers are properly classified and receive the wages they are owed,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""Workers deserve to keep what they earn. It is simply unacceptable that a multi-billion dollar company misclassified its employees and failed to abide by some of the nation's most basic labor laws."" After conducting 90 employee interviews and reviewing time and payroll records for 21,000 employees, investigators determined that UnitedHealthcare incorrectly classified employees in several different occupational categories as administratively exempt from FLSA, thereby denying them overtime compensation for all hours worked over 40 in a week. The company also failed to include certain compensation for employment in workers' regular rates, on which time and one-half should have been paid. Additionally, recordkeeping violations were uncovered, as records of the number of hours worked were not properly maintained for those who had been misclassified as exempt. The FLSA provides an exemption from both minimum wage and overtime pay for workers employed as bona fide administrative employees. To qualify for this exemption, an employee must be paid on a salary basis at a rate not less than $455 per week, must perform work directly related to the management or business operation of the employer, and must be responsible for exercising independent judgment or discretion with respect to matters of significance. In order for an exemption to apply, an employee's specific job duties and salary must meet all the requirements of the Labor Department's regulations. The amount of civil money penalties assessed was based on multiple violations of the FLSA. The FLSA requires that covered employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour as well as time and one-half their regular rates for every hour they work beyond 40 per week. The law also requires employers to maintain accurate records of employees' wages, hours and other conditions of employment, and prohibits employers from retaliating against employees who exercise their rights under the law.

Porta, Rick, L. Stejskal, Harvey L. Weaver and Anthony J. Simei, to restore $193,795 in restitution and interest to the company's 401(k) plan.

The settlement follows an investigation by the U.S. Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, which found that the women were rejected for general laborer positions at the company's Green Bay plant in 2006 and 2007. ""This is the 21st century in the United States of America. There is no such thing as a ""man's job,'"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""I am pleased that my department has been able to work out a resolution with Green Bay Dressed Beef, and that the settlement not only compensates the victims of discrimination but also provides jobs for many of these women."" In addition to financial compensation, the beef supplier will extend a total of 248 offers of employment to affected women as positions become available. The company already has hired more than 60 of the women in the original class. During a scheduled compliance review, OFCCP determined that the company had violated Executive Order 11246, which prohibits federal contractors from discriminating on the basis of gender in their employment practices. Under the terms of the conciliation agreement worked out between the Labor Department and the contractor, the $1.65 million will be divided among the affected women who return timely notifications. The company also has agreed to undertake extensive self-monitoring and corrective measures to ensure that all employment practices fully comply with the law and will immediately correct any discriminatory practices. Two of Green Bay Dressed Beefs largest clients are the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Department of Defense — as one of the largest suppliers of beef products for the federal school lunch program and one of the leading providers of beef products to American military personnel worldwide. In addition to Executive Order 11246, OFCCP's legal authority exists under Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974. As amended, these three laws hold those who do business with the federal government, both contractors and subcontractors, to the fair and reasonable standard that they not discriminate in employment on the basis of gender, race, color, religion, national origin, disability or status as a protected veteran. For general information, call OFCCP's toll-free helpline at 800-397-6251. Additional information is also available at http://www.dol.gov/ofccp."

In September 2010, MSHA announced new screening criteria for the POV program, giving the agency an additional enforcement tool to use at mines with a history of violating safety and health standards. ""As I've said many times before, the current POV system is broken, and this regulation is the next critical step in reforming the enforcement program under the existing statute,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""It would require mine operators to be much more proactive in monitoring their compliance performance and would eliminate two provisions in the existing regulation: the potential POV procedure and the requirement regarding final orders. ""Congress enacted this law 33 years ago, and not one mine has ever been placed on a POV,"" Main added. ""This proposed rule is designed to meet Congress' intent."" Among the major provisions of the proposed regulation: The proposal would specify the general criteria that MSHA would use to identify mines with a pattern of violations. These general criteria would include compliance, accident, injury and illness records. MSHA would post the specific POV criteria, along with compliance information, in a searchable (by mine) database, at http://www.msha.gov . The agency's website would allow operators to monitor their own records against the POV criteria and take proactive measures to eliminate persistent, systemic safety and health hazards, and bring their mines into compliance with MSHA safety and health standards and regulations. The proposal would eliminate the potential POV procedure, which involves written notification that a potential POV exists at a particular mining operation. No longer would mine operators receive advanced warning. Instead, screening under the proposed rule would be for mine operators that meet criteria for a pattern of violations, and the proposal would increase the frequency of MSHA's review of a mine for a POV from once to at least twice a year. MSHA believes that the ready availability of compliance data on the agency's website will eliminate the need to inform operators of a potential POV. As a mitigating circumstance in determining whether operators have a POV, MSHA would consider an operator's prior submission, for the agency's approval, of a written safety and health management program aimed at finding and fixing problems, reducing significant and substantial violations, and improving safety and health conditions for miners. A significant and substantial or S&S violation is one that reasonably could be expected to result in a serious injury or illness. The proposal would eliminate the existing requirement that only citations and orders which have become final orders can be used in MSHA's POV review. The existing requirement provides an incentive for operators to contest citations and results in final orders years after the violations have occurred. For operators placed on a POV, each S&S violation found at a mine would result in a withdrawal order until the violation is abated. Mines would remain in POV status until a complete inspection of the entire mine resulted in no S&S violations."

"January 27, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20110127,US Department of Labor announces supplemental grant funding to continue serving Wisconsin workers affected by manufacturing sector layoffs,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor today announced a $2,166,729 National Emergency Grant supplemental award to provide services to about 1,350 workers affected by layoffs and plant closures occurring within the manufacturing sector in northeastern Wisconsin. ""Access to training and job search services is crucial to manufacturing workers who are laid off in today's challenging labor market,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""I am pleased that the Labor Department is able to continue to provide this assistance to Wisconsin workers who need and deserve it."" These supplemental funds, awarded to the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development, will continue the delivery of re-employment assistance to workers included in the initial award, as well as provide services to additional workers who were laid off after the initial award was made. An initial award of $3,421,645 was approved on Aug. 5, 2009, to serve workers from 11 manufacturing companies. Some of those workers are also certified as eligible for Trade Adjustment Assistance. Today, that award is being expanded to serve workers laid off from a total of 16 manufacturing companies. The additional workers include 400 recently laid off by Kohler, a supplier of commercial and residential plumbing fixtures in Kohler, Wis. This National Emergency Grant provides the TAA-certified workers with access to ""wrap-around"" and supportive services not available through the TAA program, such as dependent care and transportation assistance. The covered workers who are not TAA-certified will have access to the full array of employment-related services allowable under this type of grant.

"January 27, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20110127,MSHA announces results of December 2010 impact and regularly scheduled inspections,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration today announced that federal inspectors issued 288 citations, orders and safeguards during special impact inspections conducted at 13 coal and 4 metal/nonmetal mine operations last month. The coal mines were issued 170 citations, 15 orders and one safeguard; the metal/nonmetal mines were issued 90 citations and 12 orders. These inspections, which began in force last April following the explosion at the Upper Big Branch Mine, involve mines that merit increased agency attention and enforcement due to their poor compliance history or particular compliance concerns, including high numbers of violations or closure orders; indications of operator tactics, such as advance notification of inspections that prevent inspectors from observing violations; frequent hazard complaints or hotline calls; plan compliance issues; inadequate workplace examinations; high numbers of accidents, injuries or illnesses; fatalities; and adverse conditions such as increased methane liberation, faulty roof conditions and inadequate ventilation. On Dec. 3, 2010, an inspection party arrived during the morning shift at Wilcoal Mining Inc.'s Tri-State One Mine in Claiborne County, Tenn. Inspectors captured and monitored the phones after production had started to prevent advance notification of their arrival. Inspectors issued 17 104(a) citations and four 104(d)(2) orders, including 104(d)(2) orders for accumulations of combustible coal dust of up to 24 inches in depth covering extensive areas where miners work and travel. Such accumulations pose a fire or explosion hazard. MSHA also issued Wilcoal a 104(d)(2) order for not properly maintaining a lifeline in the mine's secondary escapeway. Coal and rock dust on the lifeline and reflective markers could not be readily seen by miners to effectively escape to the surface. During the mine's next regular safety and health inspection on Jan. 19, 2011, MSHA found more violations, including accumulations of combustible materials, failure to maintain proper clearance on a beltline and inadequately supported ribs violations that required equipment to be shut down and coal production to cease. Tri-State One Mine was one of 13 operations to receive a letter last November putting the operation on notice of a potential pattern of violations of mandatory health or safety standards under Section 104(e) of the federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. The operation repeatedly has been targeted for an impact inspection over the last eight months. During an impact inspection conducted from Nov. 29 through Dec. 9, 2010, at Dragon Products Co. LLC's Thomaston Cement Plant in Knox County, Maine, an MSHA inspector issued 53 citations and 10 orders to the company. Six of the 10 orders were issued for failure to abate previously cited hazardous conditions. Inspectors found work orders entered into the system, but no corresponding corrective action was taken. Among the violations, inspectors noted: The dust dump perimeter drain roadway and the retention pond were not bermed, creating an overturn hazard with an 8-foot drop off. The roof top of the burner floor was missing railings, and adequate warning signs were not installed, exposing miners to a 50- to 90-foot fall. On Dec. 7, 2010, during a regular inspection, Left Fork Mining Co. Inc.'s Straight Creek No. 1 Mine of Bell County, Ky., was issued three 104(d)(2) orders for an inadequate pre-shift examination of the mechanized mining unit, an inadequate on-shift examination of the conveyer belt and accumulation of combustible materials. These orders effectively closed one entire section of the mine. One day later, MSHA issued a 104(b) order for allowing water to accumulate in a bleeder air course, a potential disruption to the mine's ventilation system. The mine is currently shut down under MSHA's order until the operator completes the pumping of water from the bleeder entry. Due to the mine closure, Straight Creek did not receive an impact inspection last month. The mine, which has been the subject of a number of impact inspections, received a letter last November putting it on notice of a potential pattern of violations. ""In spite of our relentless attempts to make mine operators accountable for their workers' safety and health, some continue to flout their responsibilities,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""While we are seeing improvements at a number of operations, the persistently bad behavior at others underscores the need for tougher legislation and stronger enforcement tools. As the condition of the Wilcoal mine demonstrates, some operators know that MSHA cannot be at a mine all the time."" Since April 2010, MSHA has conducted 198 impact inspections. These inspections have resulted in 3,758 citations, 363 orders and 13 safeguards. View the Monthly Impact Inspection List (PDF)"

The agency has taken this action to seek greater input from small businesses on the impact of the proposal and will do so through outreach in partnership with the U.S. Small Business Administration's Office of Advocacy. ""Work-related musculoskeletal disorders remain the leading cause of workplace injury and illness in this country, and this proposal is an effort to assist employers and OSHA in better identifying problems in workplaces,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health Dr. David Michaels. ""However, it is clear that the proposal has raised concern among small businesses, so OSHA is facilitating an active dialogue between the agency and the small business community."" According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, MSDs accounted for 28 percent of all reported workplace injuries and illnesses requiring time away from work in 2009. The proposed rule would not change existing requirements about when and under what circumstances employers must record MSDs on their injury and illness logs. While many employers are currently required to keep a record of workplace injuries and illnesses, including work-related MSDs, on the OSHA Form 300 (Log of Work-Related Injuries and Illnesses), the vast majority of small businesses are not required to keep such records. The proposed rule would require those employers already mandated to keep injury and illness records, and to record MSDs, to place a check mark in the new column for all MSDs. Prior to 2001, OSHA's injury and illness logs contained a column for repetitive trauma disorders that included noise and many kinds of MSDs. In 2001, OSHA separated noise and MSDs into two columns, but the MSD column was deleted in 2003 before the provision became effective. This proposal would restore the MSD column to the Form 300. OSHA and the U.S. Small Business Administration's Office of Advocacy jointly will hold a meeting to engage and listen to small businesses about the agency's proposal. Small businesses from around the country will be able to participate through electronic means, such as telephone and/or a Web forum. Details of the meeting will be announced within 30 days. OSHA also will conduct a stakeholder meeting with other members of the public if requested. Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. OSHA's role is to assure these conditions for America's working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education and assistance.

The judgment and order resolve a lawsuit filed by the Labor Department against the company for violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Under the judgment and order, the court appointed Northeast Retirement Services Inc. of Woburn, Mass., to serve as the independent fiduciary of the BlueSky Brands Inc. 401(k) Savings Plan. The independent fiduciary has the authority to manage the plan, distribute its assets to the plan’s participants and beneficiaries, and terminate the plan. The judgment was entered in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island. “It’s doubly unfortunate when the closure of a company results in workers both losing their jobs and access to the retirement benefits they have earned,” said Edward Maloney, acting regional director of the Labor Department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration in Boston, Mass. “We took this legal action to ensure that the plan is properly managed so that its participants can finally gain access to their retirement assets.” BlueSky Brands Inc. sponsored the 401(k) plan to provide retirement benefits to the plan participants. Prior to ceasing operations in March 2008, the company failed to take steps to ensure the ongoing prudent administration of the plan, according to the Labor Department’s suit. As a result, former employees of the company have been unable to access their 401(k) accounts. Under ERISA, plans must be managed by fiduciaries. In the absence of a plan fiduciary, participants and beneficiaries cannot obtain plan information, make investments or collect retirement benefits. As of Aug. 31, 2010, the plan had 77 participants and assets totaling $1,055,136.89, the latest data available. Fidelity Investments is the custodian of all of the plan’s assets and will not release those assets without the authorization of a plan fiduciary. This suit resulted from an investigation conducted by EBSA’s Boston Regional Office. The case was litigated by the Labor Department’s regional solicitor in Boston. Employers and workers can contact EBSA’s Boston office at 617-565-9600 or toll-free at 866-444-3272 for help with any problems relating to private sector pension and health plans.

Solis today took part in unveiling the Obama administration's action plan to strengthen and support military families. She joined the president and first lady, Dr. Jill Biden, other Cabinet members and administration officials, and representatives of veterans service organizations in the East Room of the White House to release the report Strengthening our Military Families: Meeting America's Commitment . ""Every day, U.S. service members – along with their families – make sacrifices that benefit all Americans,"" said Secretary Solis. ""The president understands that providing necessary support strengthens not only these individuals but our nation as a whole. Only if we do right by them do we do right by the American people."" The report was prepared by an Interagency Policy Committee comprised of Cabinet staff and overseen by the National Security Staff and the Domestic Policy Council. The committee was formed in response to a May 2010 directive from the president to develop a government-wide plan to support military families. Some components of the plan include ending homelessness among veterans and their families, increasing opportunities in federal careers, increasing opportunities in the private sector, and reducing barriers to employment and services. Secretary Solis, who chairs the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, highlighted the Homeless Veterans' Reintegration Program, specifically, expansion of the program to include grants targeting homeless female veterans and veterans with families, as well a toolkit for service providers to better understand the trauma experienced by homeless female veterans. She also reaffirmed the Labor Department's commitment to the Federal Interagency Council on Veterans Employment, which she co-chairs. In addition the Secretary emphasized other Labor Department work focused on veterans: The department has taken steps to re-engineer a Transition Assistance Program employment workshop to include more military spouses and provide a more hands-on, customized workforce readiness program. The more than 3,000 One-Stop Career Centers across the country are expanding their outreach to ensure access by military spouses to their services. And the department is committed to assisting military families through enforcement of the Family and Medical Leave Act."
"January 24, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20110124,"US Labor Department cites 2 Illinois grain elevator operators for willful safety, child labor violations following deaths of 3 workers, including 2 teens","Employers fined nearly $1.4 million MOUNT CARROLL, Ill. – The U.S. Department of Labor has fined Haasbach LLC in Mount Carroll and Hillsdale Elevator Co. in Geneseo and Annawan, Ill., following the deaths of three workers, including two teenagers. The workers were killed when they suffocated after being engulfed by grain. ""The tragic deaths of three people could have been prevented had the grain bin owners and operators followed the occupational safety standards and child labor laws,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""It is unconscionable to allow a minor to work in any high-hazard area. Haasbach's and Hillsdale's disregard for the law and commonsense safety practices has led to devastation for three families."" At least 25 U.S. workers were killed in grain entrapments last year, and the numbers of entrapments are increasing, according to researchers at Purdue University. There were more grain entrapments in 2010 than in any year since they started collecting data on entrapments in 1978. ""Grain entrapments kill workers. All employers, especially those in high-hazard industries, must prevent workers from being hurt or killed as a result of recognized hazards,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health Dr. David Michaels. ""There is absolutely no excuse for any worker to be killed in this type of incident."" The fines to both companies total $1,352,125. Haasbach was issued 25 citations from the department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration with a penalty of $555,000 following an investigation into the deaths of the two young workers, Wyatt Whitebread and Alex Pacas (ages 14 and 19 years old, respectively), at the company's grain elevator in Mount Carroll. A 20-year-old man also was seriously injured in the July 2010 incident when all three became entrapped in corn more than 30 feet deep. At the time of the incident, the workers were ""walking down the corn"" to make it flow while machinery used for evacuating the grain was running. The department's Wage and Hour Division's separate investigation found that Haasbach violated the Fair Labor Standards Act's Child Labor standards for employing anyone less than 18 years of age to perform hazardous jobs prohibited by the act. As a result, the division issued Haasbach $68,125 in civil money penalties. More information on child labor rules and hazardous occupations can be found at http://www.dol.gov/elaws . Hillsdale Elevator was issued 22 citations by OSHA following the death of a 49-year-old worker, Raymond Nowland, who was engulfed by corn in a storage bin at the company's facility in Geneseo. OSHA discovered additional violations during a later inspection of the company's Annawan facility. Consequently, OSHA issued the company $729,000 in fines. Since 2009, OSHA has fined grain operators in Illinois, Colorado, South Dakota and Wisconsin following similar preventable fatalities and injuries. In addition to enforcement actions, OSHA sent a notification letter to grain elevator operators warning them not to allow workers to enter grain storage facilities without proper equipment, precautions and training. ""OSHA will not tolerate non-compliance with the Grain Handling Facilities standard,"" said Michaels in the letter. ""We will continue to use our enforcement authority to the fullest extent possible."" OSHA's Region V, which includes Illinois, Ohio and Wisconsin, initiated a Grain Safety Local Emphasis Program in August 2010, and has since conducted 61 inspections and issued 163 violations to grain operators/facilities. The violations cover hazards associated with grain engulfment, machine guarding, lockout/tagout of dangerous equipment to prevent accidental energization start-up, electricity, falls, employee training and combustible dust hazards. These investigations also fall under the requirements of OSHA's Severe Violators Enforcement Program. Initiated in the spring of 2010, SVEP is intended to focus on recalcitrant employers that endanger workers by committing willful, repeat or failure-to-abate violations in one or more of the following circumstances: a fatality or catastrophe, industry operations or processes that expose workers to severe occupational hazards, employee exposure to hazards related to the potential releases of highly hazardous chemicals and all per-instance citation (egregious) enforcement actions.

Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. OSHA's role is to assure these conditions for America's working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education and assistance. Editor's Note: A fact sheet about the two cases follows this news release. Fact Sheet on Haasbach LLC and Hillsdale Elevator Co. Haasbach Violation Description The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration has issued Haasbach 11 willful citations with penalties totaling $504,000. The employer failed to provide body harnesses and lifelines to prevent engulfment above the waist to each of four young workers and their supervisor. It also failed to train the workers on the hazards of moving grain, and to ensure that all mechanical equipment was shut down before the workers entered the bin on the two days that they worked there. Also alleged is a willful violation for directing workers to walk on the grain to make it flow. A willful violation is one committed with intentional knowing or voluntary disregard for the law's requirements or plain indifference to worker safety and health. The grain industry has long recognized these hazards and how to prevent workers from being engulfed. Haasbach also has received 12 serious citations with penalties totaling $50,400 for additional violations of the Grain Handling, Lockout and Tagout and other standards, and one other-than serious citation with a $600 penalty for failing to provide a hazard communication program. A serious citation is issued when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known. OSHA penalties for Haasbach total $555,000. The Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division has assessed Haasbach LLC $68,125 in civil money penalties for violating the Child Labor standards of the Fair Labor Standards Act. The company employed two 14-year-olds and one 15-year-old in occupations involving warehousing and transportation. It employed two of these children in a hazardous occupation requiring them to climb 48 feet to enter a grain bin and one child in a hazardous occupation involving the operation of a power-driven hoisting device. The company also required all of the children to work more than the allowed number of work hours for minors. The workers' compensation carrier insuring Haasbach is Grinnell Mutual Reinsurance Co. Hillsdale Violation Description Hillsdale Elevator Co. has received 17 willful citations with penalties of $714,000. The citations allege eight instances of directing workers to enter bins, silos or tanks where a buildup of grain on the sides could fall and bury them. The citations also allege nine instances of failing to shut down and to lock out or take other measures to prevent mechanical equipment in the bin from endangering employees. A willful violation is one committed with intentional knowing or voluntary disregard for the law's requirements or with plain indifference to worker safety and health. Hillsdale Elevator Co. also has received five serious citations alleging violations of the Grain Handling and Lockout standards with penalties totaling $15,000. OSHA discovered the violations during its investigation into the death of a 49-year-old worker who was engulfed by corn in a storage bin at the company's facility in Geneseo, Ill. OSHA discovered additional violations during a later inspection of the company's Annawan, Ill., facility. A serious citation is issued when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known.

Additional OSHA Information OSHA maintains safety and health topics pages for grain handling at https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/grainhandling/ and agricultural operations at https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/agriculturaloperations/ . OSHA's grain handling facilities standard includes a requirement that employers provide workers entering bins or tanks with appropriate personal protective equipment such as full body harnesses for easier removal in the event of an emergency. Providing proper protection and not allowing workers to walk or stand in products piled higher than the waist reduces the risk of workers sinking and suffocating.

This agreement resolves a lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Labor after an inspection by the department's Wage and Hour Division found violations of the federal Fair Labor Standards Act. ""Vulnerable, low-wage workers have a legal right under the FLSA to be paid the required minimum wage and overtime by their employers,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""When employees are deprived of their rightful wages, employers should know that the Labor Department will not hesitate to use all enforcement tools at its disposal, including litigation when appropriate."" Wage and Hour Division investigators found that some waitstaff were paid only $10 per day, resulting in hourly pay below the federal minimum wage. In addition, the kitchen staff was paid a straight monthly salary with no overtime pay, even when working more than 40 hours in a week. Investigators also found many workers at the restaurants were paid in cash, and that time and pay records were nonexistent, inaccurate, incomplete or falsified. The parties now have reached an agreement to resolve the investigative findings, which follows the filing of a suit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, Seattle, by the Labor Department's Office of the Solicitor. As part of the consent judgment, the defendants agree not to violate the FLSA in the future. The defendants also agree to pay $5,000 in civil money penalties to the government. The FLSA requires that employers pay covered workers at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. For those employees who customarily and regularly receive more than $30 a month in tips, employers may pay a base rate of $2.13 an hour in direct wages if the tips cover the difference. Additionally, the FLSA requires that employees be paid one and one-half times their regular rates for hours worked over 40 in a week, unless otherwise exempt. Additionally, employers must maintain accurate time and payroll records.

The company is being cited with 32 safety and health violations, and $307,200 in total proposed penalties. ""This company was well aware of what it needed to do to protect its workers from a well-known hazard but failed to provide that protection,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for OSHA Dr. David Michaels. ""Lead exposure can cause many serious health issues including brain damage, kidney disease and harm to the reproductive system. Such a blatant disregard for OSHA's lead standard is shameful and will not be tolerated."" Lead Enterprises is a lead recycling and manufacturing company that produces lead products, including fish tackle, lead diving weights and lead-lined walls used in medical radiology facilities. As a follow-up to a 2009 inspection, OSHA conducted a July 2010 inspection that resulted in four willful citations and proposed penalties of $224,000. The citations allege violations of OSHA's lead standard including exposing workers to lead above the permissible exposure limit; not providing engineering controls to reduce exposure; failure to perform ventilation measurements; failure to provide a clean change area; and failure to provide a suitable shower facility for workers exposed to lead above the permissible level. A willful violation exists when an employer has demonstrated either an intentional disregard for the requirements of the law or plain indifference to employee safety and health. Additionally, 21 serious citations with proposed penalties of $70,400 allege that Lead Enterprises failed to perform an initial exposure determination for workers who clean the facility, to conduct quarterly monitoring, to notify workers of air monitoring results, to provide appropriate protective clothing, to maintain surfaces free from lead accumulation, to properly store oxygen and acetylene tanks in the facility, properly install production equipment, and to fix or remove defective forklift trucks. A serious citation is issued when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known. ""The management of Lead Enterprises acknowledged awareness of the OSHA lead standard and the dangers associated with lead exposure but continued to allow the hazard to exist, exposing employees to a serious health risk,"" said Darlene Fossum, OSHA's area director in Fort Lauderdale. Three repeat citations with a proposed penalty of $11,200 have been issued, alleging that the company failed to cover electrical wires on a furnace fan motor and record injuries on the OSHA recordkeeping forms for 2008 and 2010. A repeat citation is issued when an employer previously has been cited for the same or a similar violation of a standard, regulation, rule or order at any other facility in federal enforcement states within the last five years. Two other-than-serious citations were issued with $1,600 in proposed penalties for failing to record instances of medical removal on OSHA 300 logs, and label containers that held lead-contaminated clothing. Two additional other-than-serious citations with no monetary penalties have been issued for failing to certify forklift operators and notify the laundering facility of lead exposure dangers. In August 2010, OSHA issued citations to E.N. Range Inc. in Miami, a sister company of Lead Enterprises. E.N. Range is the primary lead supplier for Lead Enterprises, and both companies have the same owner. The earlier citations alleged that E.N. Range knowingly neglected to protect employees who clean gun ranges from serious overexposure to lead. E.N. Range also was cited for providing, without medical supervision, non-Food and Drug Administration-approved treatments for lead exposure. The company was cited for more than 50 violations of the lead and other standards, with total proposed penalties of $2,099,600. It is currently contesting the citations and penalties.

The grant program will expand opportunities for workers by: accelerating progress and reducing time to completion; improving retention and achievement rates; building instructional programs that meet industry needs; and strengthening online and technology-enabled learning. The grants will provide postsecondary institutions with an opportunity to develop and make innovative use of a variety of evidence-based learning materials, including cutting-edge shared courses and open educational resources. These resources would be available online for free, greatly expanding learning opportunities for students and workers. In addition, these learning tools will help schools and students tailor education so each worker can have a better opportunity for success in the classroom and job market. ""These grants will help educators and industry work together to ensure that more students are graduating with the skills that employers need,"" said Secretary of Education Arne Duncan. ""This program is not about tinkering – it's about transformation. This is not about getting more students to enroll – it's about getting more students to graduation day and into good jobs."" The program is designed to have a lasting impact on higher education, emphasizing collection of student outcome data and evaluation to build knowledge about which strategies best help students gain skills and credentials that are valuable in the workforce. The administration sees community colleges as an ideal place to apply this new approach because they have been leaders in seeking out strategies that get results.

He made things happen: the Peace Corps, Head Start, VISTA, Community Action, Upward Bound, Foster Grandparents, Special Olympics, the National Clearing House for Legal Services, the Indian and Migrant Opportunities, and Neighborhood Health Services. And with his late wife, Eunice, he raised a remarkable family that continues their love of service to others in so many different and important ways. ""I'm grateful to him. The program he founded and my department administers – Job Corps – has become a pathway to career success for young people who have few options in life.

The interpretation would have clarified the term ""feasible administrative or engineering controls"" as used in OSHA's noise standard. The proposed interpretation was published in the Federal Register on Oct. 19, 2010. ""Hearing loss caused by excessive noise levels remains a serious occupational health problem in this country,"" said Dr. David Michaels, assistant secretary of labor for occupational safety and health. ""However, it is clear from the concerns raised about this proposal that addressing this problem requires much more public outreach and many more resources than we had originally anticipated. We are sensitive to the possible costs associated with improving worker protection and have decided to suspend work on this proposed modification while we study other approaches to abating workplace noise hazards."" Michaels met earlier this month with the offices of Sen. Olympia Snowe and Sen. Joseph Lieberman, members of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, in response to a letter from the senators. Sens. Snowe and Lieberman are also co-chairs of the Senate Task Force on Manufacturing. Thousands of workers every year continue to suffer from preventable hearing loss due to high workplace noise levels. Since 2004, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has reported that nearly 125,000 workers have suffered significant, permanent hearing loss. In 2008 alone, BLS reported more than 22,000 hearing loss cases, and Michaels emphasized that OSHA remains committed to finding ways to reduce this toll. As part of this effort, the agency will: Conduct a thorough review of comments that have been submitted in response to the Federal Register notice and of any other information it receives on this issue. Hold a stakeholder meeting on preventing occupational hearing loss to elicit the views of employers, workers, and noise control and public health professionals. Consult with experts from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, and the National Academy of Engineering. Initiate a robust outreach and compliance assistance effort to provide enhanced technical information and guidance on the many inexpensive, effective engineering controls for dangerous noise levels. For small businesses, OSHA's On-site Consultation Program offers free and confidential advice on health and safety solutions with priority given to high-hazard worksites. Through this program, small and medium-sized employers can obtain free advice on addressing noise hazards. On-site consultation services exist in every state, and they are independent from OSHA's enforcement efforts. On-site Consultation Program consultants, employed by state agencies or universities, work with employers to identify workplace hazards, provide advice on compliance with OSHA standards, and assist in establishing safety and health management systems. Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees.

Biggerstaff, to restore $26,163.50 to the company’s 401(k) plan in voluntary employee contributions, plus lost interest. The case resulted from an investigation by the Labor Department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration into alleged violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. “It is an egregious violation of trust when employees’ voluntary salary contributions are incorporated into the general assets of the company and not forwarded to their retirement plans,” said Steve Haugen, EBSA’s regional director in Chicago, Ill. “The Labor Department will continue to help workers obtain their rightful benefits when fiduciaries fail in their responsibilities to properly administer employee benefit plans.” The lawsuit, filed in U.S. district court in Madison, Wis., alleges that the company and Biggerstaff violated ERISA by failing to forward the employee contributions to the plan from Oct. 26, 2007, through Jan. 30, 2009. Those funds were retained in Premier Vending’s general account and used to pay the company’s operating expenses. In addition, the defendants failed to timely remit employee contributions to the plan from Sept. 1, 2006, through Jan. 30, 2009. The suit seeks a court order to restore money owed to the plan and to prevent Biggerstaff from serving as a fiduciary to any ERISA-covered employee benefit plan in the future.

"January 18, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20110118,US Department of Labor seeks court order to require Gerardi Sewer & Water Co. to notify OSHA of jobsites to protect against cave-ins,"Chicago-area contractor previously issued 13 citations, $360,000 for failing to protect workers CHICAGO – The U.S. Department of Labor is seeking an administrative court order requiring Gerardi Sewer & Water Co., a Norridge, Ill.-based contractor, to provide a monthly report of its work locations to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, permit unannounced jobsite audits by qualified independent consultants and annually train workers on cave-in protection for the next two years. ""The company's severe violator history has led us to seek this order to ensure that these worksites are safe for employees,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for OSHA Dr. David Michaels. ""Cave-ins are the leading cause of death in trenching operations, and Gerardi Sewer & Water Co. has demonstrated a history of blatant disregard for worker safety."" The Labor Department filed an administrative complaint with the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission after the company contested 13 citations and $360,000 in penalties issued Dec. 17, 2010, by OSHA. In addition to asking the review commission to uphold the cited violations and penalties, the Labor Department is requesting the order for additional compliance requirements to assure the safety of workers on future jobsites. The company received the citations for failing to protect workers from cave-ins during trenching operations noted in four separate inspections conducted in 2010 under the OSHA Trenching and Excavation Special Emphasis Program. The citations are for work performed for the Illinois villages of Elmhurst, Park Ridge, Oak Lawn and Des Plaines. ""This is only the second time that the department has invoked the statutory authority to order 'other appropriate relief,'"" said Solicitor of Labor M. Patricia Smith. ""All available legal tools will be used where necessary to protect workers from future harm."" Margaret A. Sewell, a trial attorney in the Chicago Regional Office of the Labor Department's Office of the Solicitor, filed the administrative complaint with the review commission. Gerardi's December citations meet the requirements of OSHA's Severe Violator Enforcement Program, which is intended to focus OSHA enforcement resources on employers with a history of safety violations that endanger workers by demonstrating indifference to their responsibilities under the law. This enforcement tool includes mandatory OSHA follow-up inspections and inspections of other worksites of the same employer where similar hazards and deficiencies may be present. Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. OSHA's role is to assure these conditions for America's working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education and assistance.

"January 18, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20110118,US Labor Department issues final rule revising wage calculations for H-2B program,"Revised methodology better protects US workers WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor's Employment and Training Administration today announced the publication of a final rule that improves the H-2B temporary nonagricultural worker program and better protects U.S. workers. The final rule, to be published in the Jan. 19 edition of the Federal Register , addresses the calculations used to set wage rates for H-2B workers. The H-2B program allows the entry of foreign workers into the U.S. when qualified U.S. workers are not available and when the employment of foreign workers will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of similarly employed U.S. workers. The H-2B program is limited by law to a program cap of 66,000 visas per year. ""This final rule improves protections for both U.S. and foreign workers by aligning wages with marketplace realities and ensuring that the H-2B program is used as it was intended,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. Because the previous administration promulgated H-2B regulations and did not seek comment during the rulemaking process on the methodology used to set wage rates, on Aug. 30, 2010, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania ruled that the regulations issued by the department in 2008 had violated the Administrative Procedure Act. As a result, the court ordered the department to promulgate new rules that comply with the APA on the calculation of the prevailing wage rates in the H-2B program no later than 120 days from the date of the order. The department later requested additional time to extend the comment period and for drafting the rule, and the court extended the department's time by 21 days. The final rule addresses concerns that the calculation method enacted in the 2008 rulemaking did not adequately reflect the appropriate wages necessary to ensure U.S. workers are not adversely affected by the employment of H-2B workers. The wage methodology in the final rule achieves the department's goal of more fully protecting the job opportunities and wages of U.S. workers. The department anticipates issuing a future rulemaking that will address other aspects of the H-2B program. The new wage rates will apply to wages paid for work performed on or after Jan. 1, 2012. In addition, for a period of 60 days after the publication of the final rule, the department will welcome information from the public in order to gather data regarding the feasibility and implementation of phasing in the new prevailing wages. The final rule requires employers to pay H-2B and U.S. workers recruited in connection with an H-2B job application a wage that meets or exceeds the highest of the following: the prevailing wage, the federal minimum wage, the state minimum wage or the local minimum wage. The final rule also permits the use of private wage surveys in very limited circumstances. Under the final rule, the prevailing wage would be based on the highest of the following: Wages established under an agreed-upon collective bargaining agreement. A wage rate established under the Davis-Bacon Act or the Service Contract Act for an occupation in an area of intended employment, if the job opportunity is in an occupation for which such a wage rate has been determined. The arithmetic mean wage rate established by the Occupational Employment Statistics wage survey for an occupation in an area of intended employment. Read this news release en Espa ol ."

The court's decision resolves a lawsuit filed by the Labor Department against the defendants for alleged violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The court ordered the defendants to restore $9,770 in voluntary employee contributions withheld from employees' wages from Jan. 1, 2003, through Dec. 31, 2006, and $3,448 in lost interest. The lawsuit alleged that the defendants failed to forward the contributions to the plan and used plan assets to pay the company's general operating expenses.

The court cited case law that imposes ""functional"" fiduciary liability on individuals who ""are not named as fiduciaries but nonetheless exercise actual control over plan assets.""

The company operated as CEA Incorporated and CEA Inc. Under the judgment and order, the court appointed Northeast Retirement Services Inc. of Woburn, Mass., to serve as the independent fiduciary of the CEA Inc. 401(k) Plan. The independent fiduciary has the authority to manage the plan, distribute its assets to the plan's participants and beneficiaries, and terminate the plan. The judgment was entered in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The 401(k) plan was sponsored by the company to provide retirement benefits to the plan participants, who were employees of CEA Systems Inc., which ceased operations in 1998. During the period covered by the Labor Department's lawsuit, John A. Solomon was the president of CEA and served as a fiduciary to the plan. Solomon, who died in October 2001, was the only authorized signatory of the plan. Prior to ceasing operations in August 1998, the company failed to take steps to ensure the ongoing prudent administration of the plan, according to the Labor Department's suit. As a result, former employees of the company have been unable to access their 401(k) accounts. Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, plans must be managed by fiduciaries. In the absence of a plan fiduciary, participants and beneficiaries cannot obtain plan information, make investments or collect retirement benefits. As of Dec. 22, 2009, the plan had 17 participants and assets totaling $31,804, the latest data available. ""It's most unfortunate when the closure of a company ultimately causes workers to both lose their jobs and access to the retirement benefits they have earned,"" said Edward Maloney, acting regional director of the Labor Department's Employee Benefits Security Administration in Boston. ""We took this legal action to ensure that the plan is properly managed so that its participants can finally gain access to their retirement assets.""

""The Department of Justice requested this week that the Mine Safety and Health Administration postpone any plans to hold public hearings and, in a prior request, asked that we not release transcripts of witness testimony gathered thus far in the Upper Big Branch Mine accident investigation.

Booth Goodwin II, the U.S. attorney with the Southern District of West Virginia, explains that any public disclosure at this time 'poses a serious risk of hindering the criminal investigation into events at UBB."" ""From the very beginning, we have exercised extreme caution to ensure that DOJ has had every opportunity to run its own investigation. We have no intention of jeopardizing those efforts.

"January 13, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20110113,Mining deaths rise in 2010,"MSHA chief pledges continued enforcement, outreach on behalf of nations miners ARLINGTON , Va. – Mining fatalities in the United States significantly increased in 2010, following a year marked by the fewest deaths in mining history, according to the U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration. Seventy-one miners died on the job last year, compared to 34 in 2009. Forty-eight of those deaths occurred in coal mines, and 23 occurred at metal and nonmetal operations. Of the 71 mining fatalities reported, 23 of those victims were killed in surface mining accidents, while 48 miners died in underground mining accidents, 29 of whom were killed in the explosion at the Upper Big Branch mine in April. The leading cause of coal mining deaths was ignition or explosion, followed by powered haulage and roof falls. The leading cause of metal/nonmetal mining deaths was powered haulage, followed by falling or sliding material, and machinery. ""While 2010 will be remembered for the explosion that killed 29 men at the Upper Big Branch mine, we are mindful that 42 additional miners' lives also ended in tragedy,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""Increasing our efforts to ensure a safe and healthy workplace for our nation's miners is the best way to honor the memory of those who died. ""First and foremost, mine operators must take responsibility for the health and safety conditions in their mines to prevent these tragedies,"" Main added. ""Mining deaths are preventable, and actions must be undertaken to prevent them."" MSHA has taken a number of actions to identify mines with safety issues, and has initiated a number of outreach and enforcement initiatives, including ""Rules to Live By,"" a fatality prevention program spotlighting the safety and health standards most frequently cited during fatal accident investigations. That information is available on the MSHA website at http://www.msha.gov/focuson/rulestoliveby.asp . In addition, MSHA engaged in a number of targeted enforcement, awareness, outreach and rulemaking activities in 2010 to reduce the number of mining fatalities, accidents and illnesses. These efforts include: A monthly round of aggressively targeted impact inspections at mines with a history of significant and/or repeat violations, poor compliance records, and high numbers of closure orders, accidents, injuries, illnesses or fatalities. Between April and December 2010, MSHA conducted 200 impact inspections and issued 4,142 citations, orders and safeguards. New screening criteria and tougher procedures for the pattern of violations enforcement program, which gives the agency additional enforcement tools to use at mines with a history of violating safety standards, and notification of 14 mines for potential pattern of violations. First-time use under the federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 to seek injunctive action against the most recalcitrant mine operators, resulting in a settlement requiring specific safety measures to be applied to the mine. New enforcement policies and alert bulletins addressing specific hazards or problems such as prohibitions on advanced notice of MSHA inspections, mine ventilation requirements to prevent mine explosions, and miners' rights to report hazards without being subject to retaliation. A roof fall prevention awareness program aimed at reducing the high number of roof falls that occur in the nation's underground coal mines A pilot program aimed at addressing the backlog of contested citations and the agency's conferencing procedures at the Mine Safety and Health Review Commission. Issuance of a new emergency temporary standard for rock dust, which would strengthen miners' protections and minimize the potential for coal dust explosions by requiring a higher percentage of inert rock dust in underground coal mines. A safety initiative calling special attention to the potential dangers that shuttle cars and scoops pose in underground coal mines pose to miners, a leading cause of miner injury and death. A new, proposed rule that would expand requirements at underground coal mines requiring mine operators to conduct pre-shift, supplemental, on-shift and weekly examinations to determine compliance with mandatory health and safety standards. A two-part, comprehensive action plan to tackle black lung, which encompassed education, enhanced enforcement, training and rulemaking, including publication of a proposed rule on lowering miners' exposure to respirable coal dust to end black lung disease among miners. ""No miners should have to die on the job just to earn a paycheck,"" said Main. ""MSHA will vigorously enforce the Mine Act, and look for ways to improve our policies and regulations to prevent these unnecessary deaths and provide miners the opportunity to return home safe at the end of every shift,"" said Main."

Irwin, Calif. The three companies had paid employees improperly for on-call time. ""Contractors and subcontractors hired to perform services for the U.S. military have a clear obligation to comply thoroughly and consistently with federal law,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L.

The employers also were found to be in violation of FLSA recordkeeping requirements for failing to maintain proper records of the number of hours worked by employees and the compensation they were paid. The three companies have paid their employees a total of $1,060,554 in back wages owed for the period between October 2008 and October 2010. CALNET paid $676,698 to 597 employees. Acclaim Technical Services paid $234,311 to 177 employees. McNeil Technologies paid $149,545 to 91 employees. The FLSA requires that covered employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour for all hours worked, plus time and one-half their regular rates of pay, including commissions, bonuses and incentive pay, for hours worked beyond 40 per week. Employees must also maintain accurate time and payroll records. On-call time becomes compensable under the FLSA when the on-call conditions are so restrictive or the calls to duty so frequent that the employee cannot effectively use on-call time for personal purposes. These investigations were conducted by the Wage and Hour Division's West Covina District Office.

The suit alleged that the defendants violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. “Plan officials have a duty to manage and protect employees’ benefit plans and their assets,” said Roger Hilburn, Employee Benefits Security Administration’s regional director in Dallas. “EBSA took this action to restore plan assets that were not properly preserved for the company’s workers.” The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, Austin Division, alleges the defendants failed to timely and completely remit worker contributions and loan payments to the plan from Jan. 15, 2006 through Dec. 31, 2009, and from Jan. 15, 2010 through March 21, 2011. The complaint further alleges that Zarate and HBMG failed to properly administer the plan and used plan assets to benefit themselves. The court has ordered the defendants to restore plan losses and interest totaling $65,244 and undertake all necessary actions to terminate the plan and implement distributions and rollovers once plan losses have been paid. Additionally, the defendants will be permanently barred from serving as fiduciaries to any plan governed by ERISA in the future and pay the full penalty for violations.

The judgment also permanently bars former company president Suzanne Clifton from serving as a fiduciary of any employee benefit plan governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act in the future. Filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina, Western Division, the agreement resolves a lawsuit filed by the Labor Department after its Employee Benefits Security Administration conducted an investigation and, consequently, alleged violations of ERISA. The department found that Clifton and James McLamb failed to forward employer and employee contributions owed to the health plan’s third party claims administrator. The suit also alleged that the defendants failed to forward employees’ 401(k) contributions and employee loan repayments to the plan, and did not make matching contributions to the plan as required by plan documents. In a separate settlement agreement filed with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina, the Castleton Group has waived any claims against a fiduciary liability policy, which will allow an insurance company to pay $165,000 to the Castleton Group 401(k) plan to benefit participants and their beneficiaries. “These funds will help workers formerly employed by clients of this company as well as its own former staff with health insurance claims as well as restore their retirement benefits,” said R.C.

In a federal lawsuit filed on Dec. 30, 2010, MSHA claimed that personnel at the company's Mine 78 in Somerset County, Pa., and Tracy Lynne Mine in Armstrong County, Pa., provided advance notice of federal inspectors' arrival, which violates Section 103(a) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. During special impact inspections conducted Aug. 12 and Nov. 4, 2010, mine personnel were warned against giving advance notice that an inspection party was present on mine property. MSHA personnel immediately captured the phone systems at both operations to assure compliance. However, those instructions were ignored at both operations. ""Mine employees understand that advance notification is illegal,"" said Solicitor of Labor M. Patricia Smith. ""The fact that workers at these two mines were cautioned against warning their colleagues underground of the presence of federal inspectors, yet did so anyway, shows a total disregard for the law."" A preliminary injunction hearing was held on Jan. 7. On Jan. 10, Judge Kim R. Gibson issued an order enjoining Rosebud Mining Co. from giving advance notice to any person working underground at these mines that a federal mine inspector is on site. The judge also noted that the court will hold a status conference on this matter at intervals of approximately 60 days to ensure that the injunction is being enforced. The initial status conference is scheduled for March 1, 2011."

The action results from an agreement between Joe's Jeans in Commerce, Calif., and the U.S. Department of Labor following an investigation by the department's Wage and Hour Division that found the contractor failed to pay the workers minimum wage and overtime as required by the Fair Labor Standards Act. This company was enjoying high profits on the backs of vulnerable workers who were not even paid the minimum wage or overtime, said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. We expect employers to take responsibility to ensure that anyone manufacturing their products follows the law, and if they do not, we will take necessary actions to ensure that they do. The contractor, Angel's Finishing Inc., worked exclusively for Joe's Jeans, finishing jeans that were later shipped throughout the U.S. and sold at major department stores including Macy's, Neiman Marcus, Dillard's, Bloomingdale's, Saks Fifth Avenue and Nordstrom. Investigators found that Angel's Finishing paid its employees on a piece-rate basis without regard for minimum wage and overtime pay requirements for all hours worked, including some Saturdays and Sundays. Additionally, the investigators found that weekend work was not recorded on employee time cards. Joe's Jeans has paid the full amount of back wages for a two-year period and agreed to a plan promoting compliance by all its contractors. Under the plan, Joe's Jeans will conduct periodic monitoring of its contractors for FLSA compliance. The plan also calls for various education and outreach efforts, and a discussion about the financial terms of the contracts to ensure the contractors' financial ability to comply. Although in this case Joe's Jeans stepped forward to cover the full amount of back wages due, the Wage and Hour Division also assessed Angel's Finishing and its owners, Daisy Mazariegos and Estuardo Santizo, $41,140 in civil money penalties for willfully violating the law by falsifying employees' time records. The FLSA requires that covered employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage for all hours worked, plus time and one-half their regular rates of pay for hours worked over 40 per week.

"January 7, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20110107,Statement of Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis on December employment numbers,"WASHINGTON – Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis issued the following statement on the December 2010 Employment Situation report released today: ""Our nation's labor market improved notably in the month of December. Nonfarm payroll employment increased by 103,000, and the unemployment rate decreased to 9.4 percent. Today's numbers highlight this administration's continued commitment to the well-being and prosperity of the American people. And while we still have a ways to go, one thing is for certain: Our investments have reversed the trend of catastrophic job losses and put this country on the road to recovery. ""The American economy has come a long way in the last two years. In the month President Obama was inaugurated , the economy lost nearly 800,000 jobs. In 2010, every single month posted private sector job growth, with well over a million jobs added throughout the year. And job growth has occurred in a broad range of industries, led by professional and business services, leisure and hospitality, and health care. Furthermore, business and consumer spending are growing, with manufacturing activity and disposable income for American families on the rise. ""The policies and programs of this administration have pulled the economy from collapse. While we have seen steady job growth in the past year, faster job growth is needed in 2011 to help bring down the unemployment rate and put those Americans who lost jobs during the recession back to work. The Obama administration remains committed to securing a better future for every American. That's why, last month, President Obama led the charge on a successful bipartisan tax agreement, the benefits of which provide immediate relief to American families and the certainty businesses needed to get back to hiring. The agreement also included a much needed extension of Unemployment Insurance – providing a lifeline for millions of Americans as they search for work. The president's bipartisan efforts emphasize a strong commitment to a thorough recovery by creating the kind of stimulus needed to sustain steady and meaningful job growth. ""Protecting the Affordable Care Act is a large part of that commitment. Now is not the time to play politics with the health of Americans and the health of the economy. The law provides all Americans the freedom to make career choices without having to worry about losing their health insurance when changing jobs. Repealing this law would deny millions of Americans that choice. Repeal would also take health insurance away from 30 million Americans, it would allow insurance companies to boost their profits at the expense of our citizens, and it would add at least a trillion dollars to the deficit. In addition, the law includes a tax credit for small businesses to cover up to 35 percent of premium costs of their employees. In 2014, this rate coverage will increase to 50 percent. Repealing the law will make it more expensive for small businesses burdened by rising health care costs to cover their employees. ""A new year and a new Congress usher in a shared responsibility to work together to create economic prosperity for all Americans. The fact is that almost one in 10 people in the labor force are still without a job. And that is where the Labor Department – and this administration – remain focused because the American people are looking to their government for commonsense leadership during these difficult times. While the employment situation is clearly improving, my mission remains the same: to create good and safe jobs for everyone. It is what the American people are counting on and a goal we will continue to keep at the forefront of everything we do."""

The company formerly operated as Woodward Thomsen Co. The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maine, followed an investigation by the Labor Department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration into alleged violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The suit alleges that defendants Chaney and CLRS withheld plan contributions from employee wages but failed to forward those contributions to the plan from Feb. 27, 2007, through Nov. 27, 2007. Instead, the defendants allegedly used the money to satisfy obligations of CLRS, which ceased operations in November 2008. CLRS sponsored the plan to provide retirement benefits for employees of the company. Chaney, as sole owner of CLRS and a plan fiduciary, was the only individual with check-writing authority. “These defendants failed in their fiduciary duties when they allowed plan assets to be used by the company that sponsored the plan,” said Edward Maloney, EBSA’s acting regional director in Boston, Mass. “ERISA requires that plan assets be used only for plan participants and beneficiaries.” The suit asks the court to order the defendants to restore all losses with interest owed to the plan, undo any prohibited transactions and permanently prohibit Chaney from serving as a fiduciary to any ERISA-covered employee benefit plan in the future. In addition, the suit seeks to require that Chaney’s individual plan account be offset to cover the losses to the plan if necessary. The case was investigated by EBSA’s Boston Regional Office.

The company ceased operations and sold its assets in 2008. The order resolves a lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California following an investigation by the Labor Department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration. The investigation into the benefit plan of the aircraft parts and equipment manufacturer found multiple violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. “The participants and beneficiaries covered by this plan were mistreated,” said EBSA Assistant Secretary Phyllis C. Borzi. “Our legal action will ensure that these workers and their families receive their rightful benefits and that the responsible fiduciary is no longer able to harm participants in this way.” The Labor Department’s suit alleges the company and Kirn Kessen, chairman of the board and a fiduciary of the stock ownership plan, failed to properly administer the plan, make required distributions to plan participants, and procure annual appraisals of the company’s stock. During the EBSA investigation, the company made partial distributions to participants, but the shares were significantly undervalued at the time. The order excludes Kessen from distributions as a participant and permanently bars him from serving as a fiduciary to any benefit plan covered by ERISA. Employers and workers with questions or concerns regarding their private sector pension and health plans can contact EBSA’s Pasadena office at 626-229-1000 or toll-free at 866-444-3272.

The plan covered 31 participants and had $344,692 in assets as of December 2009, the latest data available. “We took this action to protect the participants who entrusted their savings to the trustee of the plan,” said Jonathan Kay, regional director of the Labor Department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration in New York. “Employers and individuals appointed as plan trustees have a legal obligation to properly manage retirement plans when a company goes out of business.” The trustee of the International Business Software Solutions 401(k) plan abandoned it and relocated outside the U.S. once the company ceased operations in 2008. Since that time, the company and trustee have not taken responsibility for the operation and administration of the plan and its assets. They also failed to appoint anyone to assume that responsibility. As a result, plan participants and beneficiaries have been unable to access their individual account balances. The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, seeks to appoint an independent fiduciary to administer the plan and distribute its assets to eligible participants and beneficiaries. The case was investigated by EBSA’s New York Regional Office. Employers and workers can reach that office at 212-607-8600 or toll-free at 866-444-3272 for help with problems relating to retirement and health benefits.

"January 5, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20110105,"US Labor Department, Massey Energy reach settlement agreement","Case involved motion for preliminary injunction against Freedom Energy ARLINGTON , Va. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration and Massey Energy reached a settlement agreement today in a case involving Freedom Energy Mining Co.'s Mine No. 1 located in Pike County, Ky. Last November, MSHA filed in federal court a motion for preliminary injunction against the mine, the first such action ever taken by the agency. Section 108(a)(2) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 provides for injunctive relief against noncompliant mine operators who habitually violate health and safety standards. Shortly thereafter, Massey announced plans to idle the mine permanently. ""Today's agreement is a legal victory not only for the Department of Labor but for all miners employed by Freedom Energy,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""Its powerful provisions allow MSHA to withdraw miners immediately over a broad range of hazardous conditions, and health and safety violations. More than ever, these types of actions are forcing mine operators to take a hard look at their safety practices."" The order, signed by Judge Amul R. Thapar of the U.S. District Court Eastern District of Kentucky, requires Freedom Energy to take certain actions to comply with a recovery plan that will ensure the health and safety of miners who continue to work at the mine as they dismantle and remove mine equipment in preparation for permanent closure. In addition to the immediate withdrawal provisions, Freedom Energy must provide timetables for activities involving removal of all mining equipment. The highest level management official, including the mine superintendent, must be available at the mine during each working shift to review and countersign the results of each pre-shift, on-shift and weekly examination performed by a certified mine examiner. Miners idled as a result of any withdrawal covered by this order must receive pay for the period during which they were idled up to one week. For periods longer than one week, the company must offer alternate equivalent work within a 60-mile radius of the mine. All requirements of the order are subject to the court's contempt proceedings."
"January 3, 2011",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20110103,"US Labor Department obtains judgment restoring nearly $34,000 in misused assets to 401(k) plan of Newton, Mass., salon","BOSTON – The U.S. Department of Labor has obtained a consent judgment requiring Sylvestre Franc Inc., operator of a salon in Newton, Mass., as well as the company’s owner and the plan trustee, to restore $33,918.73 in misused plan assets to the company’s 401(k) plan. The department’s suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleged violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Named as defendants in the suit are the company; Frank McDonnell, the company’s sole owner and president; and his wife, Sharon McDonnell, who was the named trustee of the 401(k) plan. The defendants allegedly failed to remit to the plan employee contributions withheld from Sylvestre employees’ paychecks between Oct. 1, 1998, and Dec. 31, 2008. The suit also alleged that the employee contributions, which were legally assets of the plan, were used by the defendants to satisfy the obligations of Sylvestre Franc Inc. In addition, the suit alleged that the defendants’ failure to forward employee contributions to the plan resulted in losses to the plan, including both unremitted contributions and lost earnings. “Employee benefit plan fiduciaries must act solely in the interests of the plan and its participants,” said Edward Maloney, acting regional director of the department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration in Boston. “The use of plan assets by fiduciaries for any other purpose will not be tolerated, and the Labor Department will not hesitate to take the necessary legal steps to end such misuse of plan funds.” The consent judgment, approved by the court, permanently orders the defendants to pay to the 401(k) plan a total of $33,918.73 representing principal and lost earnings. The restitution will be allocated among the participants whose contributions were withheld but never transmitted to the plan. Defendants Frank McDonnell and Sharon McDonnell are permanently prohibited by the court order from serving as fiduciaries to any employee benefit plan subject to ERISA. This case resulted from an investigation by EBSA’s Boston Regional Office. In fiscal year 2009, the department achieved monetary results of $1.3 billion in pension, 401(k), health and other benefits for millions of American workers and their families. Employers and workers can contact EBSA’s Boston office at 617-565-9600 or toll-free at 866-444-3272 for more information on ERISA’s requirements or for help with problems relating to private sector pension and health plans.

""The floodwaters may have receded, but Puerto Rico is still cleaning up,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""These funds will provide additional assistance to help clean up and repair the affected communities by creating temporary jobs."" These funds represent the second increment of a $4 million grant awarded to the Puerto Rico Department of Labor and Human Resources. On June 24, 2010, the Federal Emergency Management Agency declared 10 municipalities in the commonwealth of Puerto Rico eligible for FEMA's Public Assistance Program: Arecibo, Barranquitas, Coamo, Corozal, Dorado, Naranjito, Orocovis, Utuado, Vega Alta and Vega Baja. On July 22, 2010, a National Emergency Grant was approved for up to $4 million, with the first $1 million released immediately, to create temporary jobs for eligible dislocated workers to assist in the clean-up and recovery efforts. Additional funding up to the full amount approved will be made available as the commonwealth demonstrates a continued need for assistance. National Emergency Grants are part of the secretary of labor's discretionary fund and are awarded based on a state's ability to meet specific guidelines.

Earning overtime pay is how many Americans make ends meet, even though working long hours often means significant sacrifices for workers and their families."" CEMEX is the United States' largest supplier of cement and ready-mix concrete, as well as an important producer of aggregates, concrete blocks and other building materials. Based on 2008 company information, CEMEX is comprised of 18 cement plants either wholly or partially owned, 536 ready-mix plants, 102 aggregates quarries, 43 land distribution centers and 11 marine terminals. The Labor Department's Wage and Hour Division began a local investigation in Tampa, Fla., which disclosed systemic overtime violations resulting from the employer's failure to compensate ""pay-per-load"" employees with premium pay for hours that they worked more than 40 in a workweek. The investigation was then expanded to cover affected CEMEX employees in Arizona, California, Georgia, New Mexico, North Carolina, South Carolina and Texas. After conducting employee interviews and reviewing time and payroll records, the department's Dallas regional solicitor of labor filed a complaint with the court Sept. 11, 2008. The parties have now reached an agreement to settle allegations that CEMEX failed to properly pay overtime as required by the Fair Labor Standards Act. The agreement was filed with the U.S. District Court, Southern District of Texas, Houston Division Dec. 20, 2010. In addition to requiring that CEMEX pay the back wages it owes its employees, the court's consent order requires CEMEX to comply with the requirements of the FLSA in the future or risk being found in contempt of the order. The FLSA requires that covered employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 for all hours worked, plus time and one-half their regular rate of pay, including commissions, bonuses and incentive pay, for hours worked beyond 40 per week. Employers must also maintain accurate time and payroll records.

"December 29, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ilab/ilab20101229,"US Department of Labor awards nearly $20 million to combat exploitive child labor in Bolivia, Egypt and Jordan","WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Labor today announced nearly $20 million in grants awarded to combat exploitive child labor in Bolivia, Egypt and Jordan. The grants will fund projects that provide children with education and training opportunities, and help improve the livelihoods of families so they no longer need to rely on children's labor. These projects will work with countries that have shown strong political will to address abusive child labor and tackle its root causes. They will collaborate with national partners to scale up and sustain these efforts, and will conduct rigorous evaluations of the impact of project interventions. ""Eradicating child labor is a necessary task that binds us all together and has global benefits for everyone,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""Our experience shows it is important to forge partnerships with countries to ensure that children are educated and not exploited."" In Bolivia, the department awarded a $6 million grant to Desarrollo y Autogestion for a project that will work closely with indigenous leaders, urban and rural communities, and the government of Bolivia. The project will raise awareness of health and occupational hazards inflicted by the worst forms of child labor. The grant also will combat forced labor, and support Bolivia's new education law by helping to provide children with basic and accelerated education. In addition, it will develop technical secondary school programs, offering economic empowerment to communities and support to small enterprises that raise household incomes. The department awarded $9.5 million to the World Food Program to address child labor in Egypt's agriculture sector. It will encourage school attendance by offering school meal programs for children and food rations for their families. It will also provide entrepreneurial skills training to improve household livelihoods and access to microfinance opportunities such as village savings and loan programs, with a special focus on women. Save the Children Federation was awarded $4 million under the department's grant to Jordan. The project will address child labor within identified pockets of poverty. It will reintegrate children into formal or nonformal education systems, and transition older children of legal working age to vocational training programs or ensure their employment under safe and legal working conditions. The project will also provide vulnerable households with linkages to livelihood opportunities, improve vocational training centers, establish community protection committees and work with community leaders to raise awareness of exploitive child labor. Since 1995, Congress has appropriated approximately $780 million to the Labor Department to support global efforts to combat exploitive child labor. As a result, the department has rescued approximately 1.4 million children from exploitive child labor. More information on the department's efforts to combat exploitive child labor is available at http://www.dol.gov/ilab/highlights/if-20101215.htm."

The Swigonski Management Group 401(k) Plan, which provided retirement benefits for employees of three franchise restaurants, was sponsored by the company from January 2000 until it ceased operations in February 2006. The restaurants included Benny’s 1, Two Benny’s and Benny’s 3. The Labor Department’s suit alleges that Robert Swigonski stopped performing his fiduciary duties on behalf of the plan without ensuring the appointment of a new fiduciary to oversee the plan. He was the owner of the company and the trustee of the 401(k) plan. As a result, plan participants have been unable to access their 401(k) accounts. Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, plans must be managed by named fiduciaries. In the absence of a plan fiduciary, participants and beneficiaries cannot obtain plan information, make investments or collect retirement benefits. The suit asks the court to appoint an independent fiduciary to administer the plan, distribute its assets to eligible participants and beneficiaries, and oversee proper termination of the plan. Goldman Sachs, the plan’s custodian, was holding $24,182 in plan assets as of January 2009. “Even in a small case like this, workers should know that they can turn to the Labor Department for assistance when they find themselves locked out of access to their retirement plan,” said Edward Maloney, acting regional director of the Labor Department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration office in Boston. “We took this legal action to ensure that the plan is properly managed so that its participants can finally gain access to their retirement assets.” The case was investigated by EBSA’s Boston Regional Office. Employers and workers can contact EBSA at 617-565-9600 or toll-free at 866-444-3272 for help with any problems relating to private sector pension and health plans.

The legal action, based on an investigation conducted by the department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA), alleges that Phelan violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) during the period of May through July 2008. He allegedly failed to remit $10,470 in employee health premium contributions to the health plan’s insurance provider. Phelan also allegedly co-mingled plan funds with Phezer Enterprises’ general assets and used the money to pay the company’s general operating expenses. “The Labor Department will take whatever steps necessary to protect worker’s benefits,” said Steve Haugen, director of EBSA’s Chicago Regional Office, which investigated the case. The adversary complaint, filed in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Illinois-Western Division, seeks a court order to bar Phelan from discharging a debt relating to unremitted employee health premium contributions owed to the Phezer Enterprises Inc.

"December 22, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20101222,MSHA proposes revisions to examination requirements in underground coal mines,"Rule underscores mine operators responsibility for conducting safety and health examinations ARLINGTON , Va. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration today announced a proposal to revise its requirements for pre-shift, supplemental, on-shift and weekly examinations. The proposed rule on Examinations of Work Areas in Underground Coal Mines for Violations of Mandatory Health or Safety Standards would require mine operators to take responsibility for conducting complete workplace examinations; correcting violations; and reviewing with mine examiners on a quarterly basis all citations and orders issued in areas where pre-shift, supplemental, on-shift and weekly examinations are required. ""Examinations are the first line of defense for miners working in underground coal mines,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""Mine operators must take ownership for their workers' health and safety by conducting basic workplace examinations to assure they are in compliance with health and safety standards."" ""At the beginning of the shift, miners in an underground coal mine are particularly vulnerable to hazards and conditions in the workplace that may have developed during the prior shift. The examinations are intended to protect them,"" Main said. Under the existing standard for pre-shift, supplemental, on-shift and weekly examinations, operators are required to identify, correct and record hazardous conditions. The proposal would apply to these examinations and would require that operators also identify, correct and record violations of mandatory health or safety standards. MSHA reviewed accident investigation reports and the agency's enforcement data on underground coal mines, and concluded that the agency needed to propose changes to the existing examination requirements. By reviewing records and data over a five-year period, MSHA determined that the same types of violations of mandatory health or safety standards are found by MSHA inspectors in underground coal mines every year. Violations for accumulations of combustible materials, ventilation and roof control plans, and maintenance of incombustible content of rock dust are the top 10 cited safety standards year after year. These standards accounted for about 40 percent of the total violations at underground coal mines in 2009. Under the proposal, MSHA intends that an examiner looking for violations of mandatory health or safety standards would identify these types of violations and correct many conditions before miners suffer injury, illness or death. ""Last year, MSHA inspectors issued 82,126 citations and orders at underground coal mines,"" said Main. ""These violations should be found and fixed by mine operators, not left for MSHA to find."""
"December 22, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20101222,US Labor Departments OSHA acts to protect residential roofing workers,"Agency rescinds Clinton-era directive and gives workers more safeguards against falls WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration today announced a new directive withdrawing a former one that allowed residential builders to bypass fall protection requirements. The directive being replaced, issued in 1995, initially was intended as a temporary policy and was the result of concerns about the feasibility of fall protection in residential building construction. However, there continues to be a high number of fall-related deaths in construction, and industry experts now feel that feasibility is no longer an issue or concern. ""Fatalities from falls are the number one cause of workplace deaths in construction. We cannot tolerate workers getting killed in residential construction when effective means are readily available to prevent those deaths,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health Dr. David Michaels. ""Almost every week, we see a worker killed from falling off a residential roof. We can stop these fatalities, and we must."" The National Association of Home Builders recommended rescinding the 1995 directive, as did OSHA's labor-management Advisory Committee for Construction Safety and Health; the AFL-CIO; and the Occupational Safety and Health State Plan Association, which represents the 27 states and territories that run their own occupational safety and health programs. According to data from the department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, an average of 40 workers are killed each year as a result of falls from residential roofs. One-third of those deaths represent Latino workers, who often lack sufficient access to safety information and protections. Latino workers comprise more than one-third of all construction employees. OSHA's action today rescinds the Interim Fall Protection Compliance Guidelines for Residential Construction, Standard 03-00-001. Prior to the issuance of this new directive, Standard 03-00-001 allowed employers engaged in certain residential construction activities to use specified alternative methods of fall protection rather than the conventional fall protection required by the residential construction fall protection standard. With the issuance of today's new directive, all residential construction employers must comply with 29 Code of Federal Regulations 1926.501(b)(13). Where residential builders find that traditional fall protection is not feasible in residential environments, 29 CFR 1926.501(b)(13) still allows for alternative means of providing protection. Construction and roofing companies will have up to six months to comply with the new directive. OSHA has developed training and compliance assistance materials for small employers and will host a webinar for parties interested in learning more about complying with the standard. To view the directive and for more information, visit http://www.osha.gov/doc/residential_fall_protection.html . Read today's Federal Register notice at http://s.dol.gov/C9. Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. OSHA's role is to assure these conditions for America's working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education and assistance.

The majority of the layoffs were from four companies in the area's aviation manufacturing industry: Boeing, Bombardier Aerospace, Cessna and Hawker Beechcraft Corp. ""It is important that these workers have ongoing support as they seek out new jobs in promising regional industries,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""Helping workers who lose jobs through no fault of their own is good for the economy and simply the right thing to do."" This second National Emergency Grant increment, awarded to the Workforce Alliance of South Central Kansas, will enable the state to deliver re-employment assistance to about 1,136 participants, some of whom are also eligible for Trade Adjustment Assistance benefits. For those who are TAA-eligible, this grant provides access to supportive services, such as dependent care and transportation assistance, which are not available through the TAA program. Those workers who are not TAA-eligible will have access to a full array of training and employment services through this grant. On Feb. 19, a grant was awarded in the amount of $7,543,200, with $2,159,512 released initially, to serve workers affected by layoffs in the Wichita, Kan., metropolitan area. This latest increment will bring the total grant funds awarded for this project to $5,154,275. Additional funding, up to the amount approved, will be made available as the state demonstrates a continued need for assistance. National Emergency Grants are awarded at the discretion of the secretary of labor based on a state's ability to meet specific guidelines. For more information, visit http://www.doleta.gov/NEG/ ."

"December 21, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20101221,MSHA announces results of November impact inspections,"ARLINGTON , Va. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration today announced that federal inspectors issued 250 citations, orders and safeguards during special impact inspections conducted at 12 coal and 10 metal/nonmetal mine operations last month. These inspections, which began in force during April following the explosion at Upper Big Branch Mine, involve mines that merit increased agency attention and enforcement due to their poor compliance history or particular compliance concerns, including high numbers of violations or closure orders; indications of operator tactics, such as advance notification of inspections that prevent inspectors from observing violations; frequent hazard complaints or hotline calls; plan compliance issues; inadequate workplace examinations; a high number of accidents, injuries or illnesses; fatalities; and adverse conditions such as increased methane liberation, faulty roof conditions and inadequate ventilation. During November's impact inspections, coal mines were issued 114 citations, 11 orders and one safeguard. For metal/nonmetal mines, 113 citations and 11 orders were issued. Since April, MSHA has conducted impact inspections at 182 coal and metal/nonmetal mines. During an inspection conducted during the week of Nov. 15 at Lehigh Permanente Cement Co. Mine in Santa Clara County, Calif., MSHA issued 30 citations and six orders to the company. Five 104(d) orders were issued, including a violation for a supervisor's failure to de-energize electrically powered equipment prior to removing a guard. Another 104(d) order was issued for unsafe access where inadequately secured steel plates could have fallen on miners or delivery drivers accessing a storage area; this hazard had been reported to mine management two weeks earlier. A 104(b) order was issued for failure-to-abate in a timely manner a fall protection violation, in which miners working at the top of a mill were exposed to an approximately 36-foot drop to the concrete below. Sixty percent of the citations and orders were significant and substantial violations. So far this year, MSHA inspectors have issued 185 citations and 21 orders at this mine. ""MSHA's impact inspection program is helping to reduce the number of mines that consider egregious violation records a cost of doing business,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""We will continue using this important enforcement tool to protect the nation's miners.""

"December 21, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20101221,US Labor Department seeks comments on nursing mothers law,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division is requesting public comments on its preliminary interpretations of a new provision of the Fair Labor Standards Act that requires employers to provide nursing mothers with reasonable break time and a private space for expressing breast milk while at work. This new provision — the Break Time for Nursing Mothers Law — became law when the Affordable Care Act was signed by the president in March 2010. The provision responds to a reality that many women face when they return to work after having a baby. ""Many women who want to continue breastfeeding their children simply can't because they do not have the necessary accommodations to do it,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""What the department is seeking to do is to develop guidance for employers that will assist them in complying with this new law and that will support women who choose to continue nursing once they return to work. And with input from the public — including working mothers and employers — we'll be successful in doing that."" The department will accept public comments in response to a request for information on its preliminary interpretations for the next 60 days — with a deadline of Feb. 22, 2011 — via http://www.regulations.gov . In order to increase awareness of the new law and provide the public with access to additional resources related to workplace lactation programs, the department has launched a Web page at http://www.dol.gov/whd/nursingmothers . Employers and employees are encouraged to visit the site. It provides general information and guidance that has been issued by the department on the new break time requirements for nursing mothers in the workplace, as well as a compilation of resources that employers, employees and other interested stakeholders might find useful as they develop workplace lactation programs. Many employers already have successfully implemented lactation programs using these and similar resources. The Wage and Hour Division is responsible for administering and enforcing a number of federal labor laws, including the FLSA. The act's nursing mothers provision requires employers to provide reasonable break time for an employee to express breast milk for her nursing child for one year after the child's birth each time such employee has need to express the milk. Employers also are required to provide a place, other than a bathroom, that is shielded from view and free from intrusion from co-workers and the public, which may be used by an employee to express breast milk.

In an immensely disheartening vote, a handful of U.S. senators have chosen to shut the door on the hopes and dreams of millions of young people – our nation's future. The Dream Act is good, bipartisan legislation that would have strengthened our economy, our workforce and our national security. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has even reported that the Dream Act would cut the deficit by $2.2 billion over the next 10 years. But more importantly, it would have tapped the potential of more than 700,000 young people, allowing some of our nation's brightest a fighting chance at a better future. ""President Obama has long said that the Dream Act is not only the right thing to do for hardworking young people who seek to serve a country they know as their own; it is the right thing for the United States of America. And as the proud daughter of immigrant parents, I agree. I stand strong with the Latino community, all of this nation's immigrants and fair-minded people all over this country, knowing that this administration acted aggressively at every level in support of this bill. ""Three Republicans supported the Dream Act. Sens. Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), Richard Lugar (Indiana) and Robert Bennett (Utah) should be applauded for doing the right thing by voting for this bill. It is truly a shame that many of their colleagues didn't have the courage to follow suit. ""The American people deserve a serious debate on immigration. I agree with the president that Americans don't expect Washington to solve their problems, but they rightfully expect their government to work for them, not against them. Saturday's vote only renews this administration's commitment to continue to fight for all Americans."" Read this news release en Espa ol ."

"December 16, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20101216,Court grants MSHA injunctive relief against Maine quarry,"ARLINGTON , Va. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration announced today that it successfully obtained a court order that imposes a number of requirements on Sullivan Granite Co. LLC, which operates Brown's Meadow Quarry in Franklin, Maine. Following a hearing on Dec. 7 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maine, which resulted in an agreement between the parties, Judge John A. Woodcock Jr. ordered mine owner and operator Conrad Smith to cease operating the mine until all cited and outstanding safety and health violations have been corrected, and a federal inspector has verified that the operator is in compliance. The judge also directed the operator not to take any action to impede or interfere with MSHA inspectors in completing their inspection duties. Problems with the mine date back to a series of inspections MSHA conducted beginning last June. MSHA inspectors asserted that the mine operator violated withdrawal orders issued by MSHA; denied them entry to the property; failed to abate violations; and refused to allow access to equipment at the quarry, provide documents and information on request, and assist with the inspection. On Nov. 19, the court issued a temporary restraining order prohibiting the operator from mining in violation of withdrawal orders, denying entry, hindering inspection and failing to abate violations. In that order, the court noted that Smith claimed he was currently working alone and extracting granite solely for his own use. On Nov. 24, the Labor Department's Boston Regional Solicitor's Office, which represents MSHA and other Labor Department agencies, filed a supplemental memorandum of law supporting its pleadings, citing the cases that hold that all activity at a mine is subject to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, that owner-miner mines are covered, and that mining for personal use is likewise covered. One of the principal objectives in this action was to obtain the federal court's order that Mr. Smith stop interfering with them in their attempts to inspect the quarry and enforce the law. ""When a mine operator interferes with authorized representatives in their attempts to inspect a mine, it constitutes a continuing threat to the health and safety of the miners,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""The court's ruling will enable MSHA inspectors to carry out their duties as set forth in the Mine Act."""

Agency efforts will include stakeholder outreach, education and training, and enhanced implementation of existing standards. In particular, MSHA will focus on 30 Code of Federal Regulations 56.5002 and 57.5002, which require mine operators to conduct dust, gas, mist and fume surveys for harmful airborne contaminants' fumes to determine the adequacy of control measures. A stakeholder briefing was held today at MSHA headquarters in Arlington, Va., to outline the initiative aimed at reducing illnesses and diseases due to such overexposures, and explain MSHA's enforcement approach on complying with the standards. ""We want to ensure that miners are protected from overexposure to harmful contaminants and mine operators have required safety and health programs in place to meet that objective,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""A number of diseases and illnesses can be caused by overexposure to harmful airborne contaminants, including lead poisoning, nervous system damage, lung cancer, asbestosis, lung inflammation and scarring, bronchitis and metal fume fever,"" said Dr. Gregory Wagner, deputy assistant secretary for mine safety and health. ""Some health conditions can take a long time to develop and may not be apparent at the time of exposure. Exposure monitoring programs to identify unhealthful levels of contaminants are critical to disease prevention."" In a program policy letter issued in October, MSHA reiterated that mine operators have the primary responsibility for protecting the health of miners and must demonstrate compliance rather than rely on enforcement interventions. By conducting surveys in the workplace to determine the adequacy of exposure controls, miners are much less likely to be affected by the hazardous materials they encounter at work. ""This is a first step that includes a wide variety of industry stakeholder outreach, education, development of training programs and enhanced enforcement of existing standards,"" said Main. ""We will be working closely with the mining community, national and state mining associations, labor organizations, MSHA's Small Mines Office and others to implement this initiative. Ultimately, the goal is improved health protection for metal and nonmetal miners, and help for all mine operators to better understand and meet the requirements of this standard."" A procedure instruction letter has been issued to provide mine inspectors instructions on determining compliance with MSHA's standards for surface and underground metal and nonmetal mines pertaining to surveys for airborne contaminants required under 30 C.F.R. 56.5002 and 57.5002., available at http://www.msha.gov/regs/complian/PILS/2010/PIL10-IV-01.asp .

"December 16, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20101216,"Secretary of labor to chair homelessness council, HHS secretary vice chair","Solis and Sebelius lead charge to end homelessness WASHINGTON – Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis today was elected by the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness to lead federal efforts to end homelessness. As chair of USICH, Secretary Solis joins the newly elected vice chair, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, in implementing Opening Doors , the first federal strategic plan to prevent and end homelessness. Solis succeeds Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan, who has been chair since 2009. The council is made up of 19 agencies from the federal government which, along with state and local partners, are tasked with implementing Opening Doors . This strategic planis the most far-reaching and ambitious in U.S. history to end all types of homelessness, including ending chronic homelessness and homelessness among veterans in five years, while ending homelessness for families, youth and children within a decade. The Department of Labor played an integral role in the development of Opening Doors , and is leading the efforts to increase sustainable employment and create meaningful careers for the nation's most vulnerable populations. ""Ending the continuing tragedy of homelessness demands thoughtful and focused efforts,"" said Secretary Solis. ""I look forward to building upon Secretary Donovan's leadership of the council to promote the importance of interagency collaboration as we implement Opening Doors . The bottom line is that the best defense against homelessness is a job that pays. That is why the Department of Labor is leading efforts to prevent and end homelessness with job training and employment services for this underserved population."" The mission of the USICH is to coordinate the federal response to homelessness, and to create a national partnership with every level of government and the private sector to address homelessness in the nation. The Obama administration has been committed to preventing and ending homelessness both in funding and in coordinating federal government efforts to address the issue. The Homelessness Prevention and Rapid Re-Housing Program created by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act has prevented or ended homelessness for 750,000 people since 2009. The Affordable Care Act is providing new and more effective methods for targeting the uninsured, including chronically homeless individuals, families and children who experience homelessness. In addition, as part of the effort to end homelessness among the nation's veterans, the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Department of Housing and Urban Development have provided permanent housing to more than 20,000 veterans and families through the HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing program with an additional 10,000 being housed in the next year. Also, the Labor Department is providing job training and employment services to more than 15,000 veterans who are homeless or at risk of being homeless. ""Together this coalition has proven that homelessness isn't simply a noble fight, but a problem we can solve,"" said Secretary Donovan. ""As the outgoing chairman of the Interagency Council on Homelessness, I'd like to acknowledge my extraordinary colleagues, Secretary Solis of the Department of Labor and Secretary Sebelius of the Department of Health and Human Services – as well as the great work of both Secretary Shinseki at the Department of Veterans Affairs and USICH Executive Director Barbara Poppe. With their leadership, I am confident that we will continue to work strategically and effectively to serve all people at risk of homelessness in this country."""

Solis today announced the release of three reports on child labor and/or forced labor around the world. Secretary Solis was joined by Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa at U.S. Department of Labor headquarters in unveiling the reports. ""We consider the eradication of the worst forms of child labor to be a matter of urgency,"" said Secretary Solis. ""We hope these reports will assist governments around the world in taking effective next steps to eliminate the exploitation of children. No human being should work under conditions of forced labor or debt bondage or be forced to work under fear of punishment. Shining light on these problems is a first step toward motivating governments, the private sector and concerned citizens to take action to end these intolerable abuses that have no place in our modern world."" The reports were developed by the department's Bureau of International Labor Affairs, also known as ILAB, based on data collected from U.S. embassies, foreign governments, international and nongovernmental organizations, technical assistance and field research projects, academic research and the media. Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor is a report mandated by the Trade and Development Act of 2000 that provides information on the efforts of certain U.S. trade beneficiary countries to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. This year's report introduces a new format highlighting the major findings related to each government's efforts and includes country-specific suggestions for actions that would help combat these problems. ILAB also released an update to its List of Goods Produced by Child or Forced Labor required by the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2005. The update adds six new goods and 12 new countries for a total of 128 goods from 70 countries that ILAB has reason to believe are produced by forced labor, child labor or both in violation of international standards. In addition, ILAB released a proposed revision to the current List of Products Produced by Forced or Indentured Child Labor under Executive Order 13126 of 1999 . The revision removes one product and adds another, maintaining a total of 29 products from 21 countries. These proposed changes to the executive order list will be available for a 60-day public comment period beginning Dec. 16. By the end of 2010, ILAB will have funded more than $740 million in programs to help more than 80 countries combat the worst forms of child labor. The agency conducts research on and formulates international economic, trade and labor policies in collaboration with other U.S. government agencies, and provides international technical assistance in support of U.S. foreign-labor policy objectives.

Solis today announced the award of $40 million in grants by the U.S. Department of Labor in 2010 to combat exploitive child labor in 12 countries. The grants will offer children access to educational and training alternatives, help improve the livelihoods of their households so their parents can meet basic needs without relying on child labor, and build local capacity to scale-up and sustain efforts to eliminate exploitive child labor. ""Eradication of child labor is a necessary task that binds us all together and has global benefits for everyone,"" said Secretary Solis. ""These projects will offer children hope through education and help their families provide for themselves and overcome the poverty that leads to child labor."" In Sub-Saharan Africa, the department awarded $15.5 million in grants to the International Labor Organization's International Program on the Elimination of Child Labor for projects in West Africa and the countries of Lusophone Africa. These projects include efforts to address exploitive child labor in sectors such as cocoa, quarrying and mining, and a partnership with Brazil to support the sharing of good practices through South-South Cooperation. In Latin America, the department awarded $10 million for a project in El Salvador that will focus on participatory strategies, economic empowerment, and promotion of social inclusion as a means to address the root causes of child labor. In Asia and the Middle East, the department awarded $2 million for a project to help achieve the goal of a child labor-free Jordan and a $9 million grant in Thailand to address child labor in the shrimp and seafood sector. In addition, to region-specific projects, the department has awarded $3.5 million for a global project focusing on child labor research and impact evaluation, implemented by ILO-IPEC and Understanding Children's Work. Since 1995, Congress has appropriated approximately $780 million to the Labor Department to support efforts to combat exploitive child labor internationally. As a result of that funding, the department has rescued approximately 1.4 million children from exploitive child labor.

"December 14, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20101214,MSHA initiative highlights dangers related to mobile equipment use in coal mines,"Shuttle cars and scoops linked to 16 fatalities, nearly 800 injuries since 2000 ARLINGTON , Va. – Through a new safety initiative, the U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration is calling special attention to the potential dangers that shuttle cars and scoops in underground coal mines pose to miners. Between January 2000 and September 2010, nearly 800 miners have been injured and 16 killed in coal mine accidents involving shuttle cars and scoops. Three of those deaths occurred this year. ""We are concerned by the large number of injuries and fatal accidents involving shuttle cars and scoops, and are especially alarmed by the number of deaths that occurred just this year,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""On too many occasions, miners are being hit or crushed by this type of mobile equipment, primarily due to the obstructed view of the driver. Miners need to be more aware of the presence of these vehicles, and mine operators need to provide safety protections to prevent these injuries and deaths."" Shuttle cars and scoops are used to transport material from one area of the mine to another. The vehicles operate in close quarters and tight travel ways, where space is limited. When these vehicles are loaded, a driver's view of the travel way may be obstructed, making movement dangerous and presenting serious hazards to other working miners in the area. Using the slogan ""Watch Out!,"" MSHA has developed new posters, hard hat stickers and best practice resources to address the issue of worker safety around shuttle cars and scoops in underground coal mines, and mine inspectors will distribute the materials to miners at these operations. The handouts warn miners to watch out for moving mobile equipment in the underground area at all times. MSHA also advises miners to wear reflective clothing or reflective patches that make them more visible to equipment operators. Miners should make certain that equipment drivers can actually see them by signaling their presence in a way that will get the driver's attention. They are encouraged to keep a safe distance from and avoid walking in front of moving shuttle cars or scoops. ""Mine operators need to determine safe routes of travel for miners and equipment, and examine systems that better establish a worker's location, such as the use of small strobe lights for miners on foot,"" Main said. For several years, MSHA has actively encouraged the development and use of ""proximity detection"" technology on mining equipment, which can sense the presence of people and machinery within a certain distance of the equipment. These systems can be programmed to send warning signals and stop machine movement when a certain area or space near the system is breached. ""Proximity detection systems, used in conjunction with good safety practices around mobile equipment, could bring an end to fatal accidents involving shuttle cars and scoops in underground coal mines,"" Main added."
"December 14, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20101214,"US Labor Departments OSHA fines WRR Environmental Services Co. $787,000 following June explosion","EAU CLAIRE , Wis. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration today cited the hazardous waste management processor, WRR Environmental Services Co., for failing to implement measures to prevent potentially catastrophic chemical fires and explosions at its facility in Eau Claire. OSHA has issued 14 willful and one serious citation to the company with proposed penalties of $787,000 for failing to fully develop and implement a process safety management program at the facility. This action stems from the agency's investigation of a June 29 explosion and fire at the facility. ""WRR Environmental Services put its workers in grave danger, and it is truly fortunate that no one was killed or severely injured in these incidents. The company's blatant disregard for workers' health and safety is not acceptable,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""Even after WRR Environmental Services experienced a devastating fire that destroyed the facility in 2007, the company still failed to implement an adequate program to ensure safe operating conditions,"" added Assistant Secretary of Labor for OSHA Dr. David Michaels. The June 29 explosion and fire was likely caused when an ignition source within a solvent sludge feed tank ignited flammable solvent vapors, blowing the roof off of the tank and igniting its contents. A neighboring tank also exploded. Employees had been working in the area of the solvent sludge feed tank immediately prior to the explosion. Fortunately, there were no reported injuries. OSHA has issued WRR Environmental Services Co. Inc. 14 willful citations with proposed fines of $784,000. The citations allege an intentional disregard of the elements of the PSM standard, including failure to implement and provide required process safety information such as engineering drawings and materials of construction; failure to implement process hazard analyses, operating procedures and training; failure to perform pre-startup safety reviews and inspections and tests on process equipment; equipment deficiencies; failure to implement change management procedures; and failure to conduct incident investigations. A willful violation is one committed with intentional knowing or voluntary disregard for the law's requirements, or with plain indifference to worker safety and health. WRR Environmental Services Co. Inc., which currently employs more than 50 workers, has been inspected by OSHA five times since 1991. In 2007, a fire and explosion destroyed most of the facility including the solvent sludge recycling processes. As a result of those inspections, the company admitted to 30 serious and four other-than-serious safety violations. As a result of OSHA's most recent inspection, the company also has received one serious citation with proposed penalties of $3,000 for alleged deficiencies in its emergency action plan. A serious citation is issued when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known. This investigation falls under the requirements of OSHA's Severe Violators Enforcement Program. Initiated in the spring of 2010, SVEP is intended to focus on recalcitrant employers who endanger workers by committing willful, repeat or failure-to-abate violations. For more information on SVEP, go to http://www.osha.gov/dep/svep-directive.pdf . The company has 15 business days from receipt of its citations and penalties to comply, request an informal conference with OSHA's area director or contest the findings before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. Employers and employees with questions regarding workplace safety and health standards can call OSHA's Eau Claire office at 715-832-9019. To report workplace incidents, fatalities or situations posing imminent danger to workers, call OSHA's toll-free hotline at 800-321-OSHA (6742). Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. OSHA's role is to assure these conditions for America's working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education and assistance.

""The department will not hesitate to pursue legal action, including debarment, to ensure employees are properly paid under the law,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. An investigation by the Labor Department's Wage and Hour Division District Office in New York City revealed that the companies and their officials had violated wage and benefit requirements of the Davis-Bacon Act and the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act on two New York City public housing construction projects that were partially funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The investigation found that the companies had failed to pay prevailing wage rates and fringe benefits to some employees, failed to pay employees time and one-half their basic rate of pay for hours worked over 40 in a week, and submitted inaccurate certified payroll and time records. In filing an order of reference with the department's Office of Administrative Law Judges, the Labor Department is seeking not only full restitution of all back wages due to the employees but also the debarment of Enviro & Demo Masters Inc.; Gladiators Contracting Corp.; the owner and president of both companies, Jover Naranjo; and Luperio Naranjo from working on future federally-funded contracts for a period of up to three years. Enviro & Demo Masters and Gladiators Contracting were subcontractors to Lettire Construction Corp., which itself was a subcontractor on two contracts awarded by the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development for the following housing projects: The Ciena Project located at 30-324 E. 100 St. in Manhattan and Hobbs Court Project, located at 315 E. 102 St. in Manhattan. The prime contractors on these projects, which are part of the Metro North Rehabilitation Redevelopment Program, were Hobbs Ciena Associates LP and Hobbs Ciena Housing Development Fund Corp. The Davis-Bacon Act requires all contractors and subcontractors performing work on federal and certain federally-funded projects to pay their laborers and mechanics the proper prevailing wage rates and fringe benefits as determined by the secretary of labor.

Capital Management Inc. of Atlanta, Ga., and owner Paul H. Saylor to restore $1,090,000 to the Plumbers and Pipefitters National Pension Plan as restitution for improperly investing $25 million in risky private placement bonds. The firm also was ordered to pay $109,990.91 in fines to the federal government. C.S. Capital Management, formerly known as Chadwick, Saylor & Co., is an investment firm hired by the plan to evaluate and make a recommendation on the purchase of bonds that financed the Playa Vista development project in Los Angeles, Calif. The plan covers more than 123,000 participants nationwide. A lawsuit brought by the Labor Department, filed simultaneously with the order in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia in Alexandria, alleges that Saylor and the firm violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act by making the decision to purchase Playa Vista B bonds for the plan and purchasing the bonds on Nov. 9, 1998. According to the suit, the bond issuer paid one interest payment to the plan in 2001 and has not made any interest or principal payments since. The suit also alleges the defendants acted imprudently by purchasing bonds with an unduly low rate of return compared to the risk assumed by the plan and by purchasing bonds that subordinated the plan’s investment to that of Playa Vista A bondholders. As a result, it was less likely that the plan would recover its investment and interest. “These defendants violated their duty to responsibly manage the plan’s investments,” said Secretary of Labor Hilda L.

The company, which formerly operated as Athol Ford and Mercury, was the sponsor and administrator of the plan, and Christopher Wong served as the plan’s trustee.

"December 9, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20101209,US Department of Labor announces grant to assist Wisconsin workers impacted by layoffs at Chrysler Kenosha Engine Plant,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor today announced a $2,601,207 grant to assist about 448 workers affected by the closure of the Chrysler Kenosha Engine Plant located in Kenosha, Wis. ""The Labor Department is committed to helping all workers who have lost jobs through no fault of their own – including those in the nation's auto communities,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""Helping these workers in Wisconsin get back on a career path is good for working families, local communities and the economy as a whole. It makes sense and it's the right thing to do."" Awarded to the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development, this grant will be operated by the Southeast Wisconsin Workforce Development Board. The grant will provide these dislocated workers, all of whom are also certified as eligible for Trade Adjustment Assistance, with access to ""wrap-around"" and other supportive services not available through the TAA program. In August, Chrysler issued a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice announcing the permanent closure of its engine manufacturing facility in Kenosha. The plant closed in October, ending more than 100 years of auto industry employment in the city. Of the $2,601,207 announced today, $1,207,576 will be released initially. Additional funding up to the amount approved will be made available as the state demonstrates a continued need for assistance. National Emergency Grants are awarded at the discretion of the secretary of labor based on a state's ability to meet specific guidelines. For more information, visit http://www.doleta.gov/NEG/ ."
"December 9, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20101209,"Statement by Labor Secretary Hilda L. Solis on President Obamas framework for bipartisan agreement to extend Unemployment Insurance, help middle-class families","WASHINGTON – Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis today issued the following statement regarding President Obama's framework for a bipartisan agreement to extend Unemployment Insurance and help middle-class families. The framework includes $56 billion to extend Unemployment Insurance, a $120 billion payroll tax cut for workers, $40 billion in tax cuts for the nation's hardest-hit families and students, and 100 percent expensing for small businesses over the course of 2011. ""Yesterday President Obama laid out a thoughtful framework for a bipartisan agreement that would extend Unemployment Insurance and keep the taxes paid by middle-class families from increasing. ""By the president's own account, the agreement is not perfect. But it is crucial for American families and for the American economy. ""The framework avoids a $3,000 tax increase for the typical working family and ensures that millions of working-class Americans won't see their tax cuts go away next year either. It also continues the American Opportunity Tax Credit for households with college-bound students and the Earned Income Tax Credit for low-income families. These are high-impact, job-creating tax cuts for working families. ""The agreement also provides a critical extension of unemployment benefits through the end of 2011. Without it, by the end of December, 2 million men and women looking for work would see their unemployment benefits come to an early end. Over the next year, their ranks would increase to more than 7 million people. For these individuals – none of whom were fired or quit, but who lost their jobs through no fault of their own – this means not having to worry their unemployment benefits could be eliminated abruptly as they search for jobs. ""This is a smart investment, not only in those who continue to look for work but for the economy as a whole. Every dollar that goes toward Unemployment Insurance generates $2 in economic activity. In fact, since the start of the recent recession, the Unemployment Insurance program has helped to boost gross domestic product by $315 billion. It also has saved an average of 1.6 million jobs per quarter. ""In addition to the UI extension, the president's framework includes measures for jump-starting growth and spurring private sector job creation. An important payroll tax cut will help more than 155 million workers and provide nearly $120 billion in tax relief next year. The president also fought for a provision that would temporarily allow 2 million businesses to expense all of their investments in 2011. This ""complete expensing"" could generate more than $50 billion in additional investment, and it would be the largest temporary investment incentive in American history. ""These are all important, responsible, temporary measures to support our economy that will not add costs by the middle of the decade. I share the president's belief that it is not affordable to make the high-income tax cuts permanent and look forward to that debate in the years ahead. ""In the midst of political rhetoric, it can be far too easy to lose sight of the fact that this economy belongs to all of us – whatever our income or employment status. The president understands that, and he is leading the way on a difficult but important compromise. ""I urge federal legislators to support this agreement, not just because it is the right thing to do for those who are desperately looking for work this holiday season but because it is the right thing to do for everyone in America.""

"December 8, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20101208,Statement by Labor Secretary Hilda L. Solis on Robert C. Byrd Mine Safety Protection Act of 2010,"WASHINGTON – Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis today issued the following statement on the U.S. House of Representatives' vote of 214-193 on the Robert C. Byrd Mine Safety Protection Act of 2010. The measure was taken up by the House as a ""suspension"" – a legislative mechanism requiring a two-thirds majority of House members agreeing to the motion to allow its passage. ""I am deeply disappointed that the House of Representatives today failed to pass the Robert C. Byrd Mine Safety Protection Act of 2010 under suspension of the rules. This commonsense legislation, championed by Chairman George Miller of the Education and Labor Committee, would be an important step forward in strengthening safety laws for our nation's miners. ""The measure would compel the worst of the worst in the mining industry to change how they treat their miners. ""Despite the outcome of today's vote in the House, it is important to note that a majority of the members showed they have run out of patience with those mine operators who refuse to take the safety and health of miners seriously. ""As this Congress winds down, the tremendous need for this legislation continues. Every day the lives of miners are needlessly being put at risk. That should be unacceptable to every single member of Congress. ""All workers deserve to come home safe at the end of a shift. I urge every legislator to join the president and me in committing to bringing miners the safety reforms they deserve."""
"December 8, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20101208,Statement by Labor Secretary Hilda L. Solis   on DREAM Act,"WASHINGTON – Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis today issued the following statement on the cusp of Congressional action on the Development, Relief, and Education for Minors Act. The DREAM Act would provide a process by which certain students and members of the military – who excelled through hard work and demonstrated their positive contributions to the nation – can obtain conditional nonimmigrant status and, after a period of time, lawful permanent residence: ""No investment yields as great a return as the one we make in people. That is precisely what the DREAM Act is all about. ""Allowing these young people, who have never known a nation other than America as home and who have excelled academically or served our country, the chance to earn lawful immigration status through a pursuit of higher education or service in our armed forces is the right thing to do. But it is also the smart thing to do. ""The DREAM Act would reduce our deficit by $1.4 billion over the next 10 years. It would achieve that through the increased tax revenues that individuals who attend college and earn legal status will generate as they become doctors, engineers, or otherwise realize their full potential. ""I have personally met and worked with many students who would be impacted by this legislation. In fact, early in my career, I worked as a student advisor and higher education recruitment counselor. Many of the young people I worked with were undocumented, including a college-bound young man whose academic achievements and dedication to hard work made him a model student in everyone's eyes. ""This young man gave everything his all. Today he's an environmental scientist. He has a rewarding, interesting and good-paying job. And he is making his own unique contribution to our country, our economy and the world. There are thousands of young people just like him. They understand what a privilege it is to live in a country like America. They want – and are ready – to give back to the only homeland they know, as high-achieving students and as men and women in uniform. ""The president and I believe giving these young people that chance is the right thing to do – for them, and for the nation as a whole. That is why we have aggressively engaged federal legislators in support of the DREAM Act. Tonight, as Congress takes up the bill, I once again urge members of that chamber – including those on the Republican side of the aisle who have recognized the wisdom of this legislation in the past – to support passage of the DREAM Act. It's the right thing to do, and it just makes sense."" Read this news release en Espa ol ."
"December 8, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/odep/odep20101208,US Labor Departments Office of Disability Employment Policy announces new outreach tools from Campaign for Disability Employment,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Labor's Office of Disability Employment Policy today announced a series of new products through the Campaign for Disability Employment that are designed to promote the hiring, retention and advancement of people with disabilities, and dispel negative stereotypes about disability and employment. The Campaign for Disability Employment is a collaborative of leading disability and business organizations funded by ODEP. It recently unveiled seven educational posters and two discussion guides to accompany the campaign's flagship ""I Can"" public service announcement. The two PSA discussion guides are a ""Workplace Discussion Guide"" to help employers and human resource professionals facilitate staff conversations on flexible and inclusive workplaces, and a ""Youth Discussion Guide"" to help start a conversation among youth, with and without disabilities. The youth guide emphasizes the importance of focusing on ability and talent, not making assumptions about what people can and cannot do, and setting goals for employment. Each guide includes a DVD of the PSA. The seven ""What can YOU do?"" posters can be ordered individually. Each addresses a different audience and features a compelling image and message about disability and employment. Organizations may display the posters on workplace bulletin boards or in schools, training centers, places of worship and other community centers. The discussion guides and posters, as well as other campaign outreach tools, can be downloaded or ordered free of charge through the outreach toolkit on the campaign's website at http://www.whatcanyoudocampaign.org . Since its release in March 2010, ""I Can"" has aired more than 45,000 times in media markets nationwide, during donated television and radio airtime valued at more than $11 million dollars. In addition, the PSA was shown before feature films in more than 4,700 AMC Entertainment movie theaters during October. The Campaign for Disability Employment seeks to promote positive employment outcomes for people with disabilities by encouraging employers and others to recognize the value and talent these employees bring to the workplace. Campaign partners include the American Association of People with Disabilities; the National Business and Disability Council; the National Council of La Raza; the National Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce; the Society for Human Resource Management; Special Olympics; and the U.S. Business Leadership Network."
"December 7, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20101207,"US Labor Departments OSHA fines US Minerals facility in Illinois $396,000 for 28 violations, including exposure to hazardous dust","COFFEEN, Ill. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration has cited U.S. Minerals LLC with willfully exposing its workers to dangerously high levels of hazardous dust, and not providing adequate breathing protection and training for workers at its facility in Coffeen. The company, headquartered in Dyer, Ind., has been issued a total of 28 health and safety citations with proposed penalties of $396,000. ""U.S. Minerals has severely jeopardized the health and safety of its workers by exposing them to extremely high levels of hazardous dust and other dangers,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for OSHA Dr. David Michaels. ""This is the fourth U.S. Minerals facility where very serious violations were cited in the past three months, clearly indicating these problems are widespread and systemic. This blatant disregard of workers' health and safety is not acceptable."" Inhalation of the hazardous dust material produced at the facility can cause debilitating lung disease such as pneumoconiosis, which is characterized by symptoms including chronic cough, difficulty breathing and shortness of breath. This investigation falls under the requirements of OSHA's Severe Violators Enforcement Program. Initiated in the spring of 2010, SVEP is intended to focus on recalcitrant employers who endanger workers by committing willful, repeat or failure-to-abate violations in one or more of the following circumstances: a fatality or catastrophe; industry operations or processes that expose workers to severe occupational hazards; employee exposure to hazards related to the potential releases of highly hazardous chemicals; and all egregious enforcement actions. For more information on SVEP, go to http://www.osha.gov/dep/svep-directive.pdf . OSHA has issued the U.S. Minerals Coffeen facility six willful citations with proposed fines of $336,000 for exposing workers to levels of hazardous dust at concentrations higher than the permissible exposure limit; failure to implement a written respiratory protection program or to mandate employees wear respirators; failure to implement engineering controls to reduce harmful dust exposures; and failure to develop and utilize energy control procedures. A willful violation is one committed with intentional, knowing or voluntary disregard for the law's requirements or plain indifference to employee safety and health. ""U.S. Minerals continually has failed to come into compliance on safety issues such as providing adequate breathing protection,"" said OSHA Area Director Thomas Bielema in Fairview Heights, Ill. ""We are committed to seeing that the workers at this facility are provided a safe and healthful workplace."" The company has received seven repeat citations with fines of $34,200 for violating permit-required confined space entry rules, failure to provide fall protection, failure to provide required training on energy procedures and failure to provide guards on mechanical powered equipment. A repeat violation is issued when an employer previously has been cited for the same or a similar violation of a standard, regulation, rule or order at any other facility in federal enforcement states within the last five years. The company also has been issued 10 serious citations with proposed penalties of $24,000. Violations include failure to assess the need for adequate personal protective equipment; inadequate eye protection; failure to develop procedures and practices for permit-required confined space entry; lack of a written hazard communication program; inadequate information and training on dust containing silica; and failure to cover floor holes and enclose electrical boxes. A serious citation is issued when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known. The company also has received five other-than-serious citations with $1,800 in penalties for lack of proper injury and illness recordkeeping. An other-than-serious violation is one that has a direct relationship to job safety and health but probably would not cause death or serious physical harm. The company manufactures abrasive blasting and roofing materials from slag produced at coal-fired power plants. In September, OSHA issued a $466,400 penalty to the company's facility in Baldwin, Ill., citing 35 health and safety violations for willfully exposing workers to dangerously high levels of hazardous dust and failing to provide adequate breathing protection. As a result of the egregious conditions found at that worksite, OSHA initiated inspections of the company's other facilities, including the Coffeen location. The company's Harvey, La., operation was cited last month with 30 violations and proposed penalties of $110,400. The Galveston, Texas, facility was fined $273,000 last week, and cited with 38 violations for exposing workers to fall and machine guarding hazards. The company has 15 business days from receipt of its citations and penalties to comply, request an informal conference with OSHA's area director or contest the findings before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. Employers and employees with questions regarding workplace safety and health standards can call OSHA's Fairview Heights Office at 618-632-8612. To report workplace accidents, fatalities or situations posing imminent danger to workers, call OSHA's toll-free hotline at 800-321-OSHA (6742). Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. OSHA's role is to assure these conditions for America's working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education and assistance.

The Newark company sponsored the H-1B non-immigrant workers to work as programmer analysts across the country. Under the order, Peri Software Solutions Inc. and Periasamy also must pay $126,778 in civil money penalties and interest for failing to provide notice of the filing of labor condition applications at each place where any H-1B worker was to be employed and for filing lawsuits against H-1B workers for early cessation of employment. The company and Periasamy will be debarred from participating in the H-1B program for one year. ""Peri Software not only took advantage of these workers by not properly compensating them, it also violated the part of the law that provides the greatest protection to the American workforce,"" said Nancy J. Leppink, deputy administrator of the department's Wage and Hour Division. ""When companies participating in the H-1B program do not post filed labor condition applications, they clearly undercut American workers who may be qualified for available employment but aren't aware of it."" Since 2005, investigations conducted by the department's Wage and Hour Division have resulted in more than $5.6 million in back wages and $300,000 in civil money penalties in New Jersey, not including this case. The most common violations found were the employers' failure to post notice of the filing of labor condition applications at every worksite where an H-1B worker may be employed, and failure to pay non-immigrant workers the required wage rate for all nonproductive time caused by conditions related to employment, such as lack of assigned work, lack of a permit or studying for a licensing exam. The H-1B visa program permits employers to temporarily hire foreign workers in professional occupations such as computer programmers, engineers, physicians and teachers. H-1B workers must be paid the same wage rates paid to U.S. workers who perform the same types of work or the prevailing wage rate in the areas of intended employment, whichever is higher.

This resource is intended to assist federal and private-sector employers in identifying workers with disabilities. The more than 2,200 candidates in this year's database represent all academic backgrounds and are working toward, or recently earned, associate, bachelor's, master's, doctoral and law degrees. Students have been interviewed by recruiters from various federal agencies. Some seek summer employment, while others are looking for regular, full-time positions. ""This database is filled with talented students who are highly motivated to prove their skills in the workplace,"" said ODEP Assistant Secretary Kathy Martinez. To take advantage of the new database, federal officials can visit http://www.wrp.gov to register and search independently for candidates who meet their hiring needs. They also can track the status of candidates they are interested in interviewing, including whether they already have been hired. Private-sector employers can search the program's database through ODEP's National Employer Assistance and Resource Network by making a toll-free telephone call to 866-327-6669 or filling out a request form at http://www.earnworks.com .

An investigation by the Labor Department’s Wage and Hour Division revealed that the company and its officials had violated wage and benefit requirements of the Davis-Bacon and Related Acts and the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act on three federally-funded housing construction projects in New York City. In addition to paying the back wages, Sant-Tec Electric, President Manuel Montesino and Human Resources Manager Olga Pena will be debarred from working on future federally-funded contracts for a period of three years. ""Workers employed on federally-funded projects must be paid proper wages and fringe benefits,"" said Maria Rosado, the New York district director for the Wage and Hour Division. ""Contractors and subcontractors working on such projects should know that the Labor Department will pursue them if they don’t pay their employees properly under the law."" The investigation by the Wage and Hour Division’s New York City District Office determined that Sant-Tec failed to pay the prevailing wage rates and fringe benefits to some of its employees, failed to pay some of its employees for all hours worked, failed to pay its employees overtime for hours worked over 40 in a week and submitted certified payroll records that did not accurately reflect all the hours worked by employees on the project. Sant-Tec was a subcontractor to Lettire Construction Corp., which itself was a subcontractor on three contracts awarded by the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development for the following housing projects: The Claremont Project, 1421 College Ave., Bronx, N.Y. — prime contractor Claremont Park Associates LP; Fortune Society Project, W. 140 St., New York, N.Y. — prime contractor 625 W. 140 St. LP c/o Fortune W. 140 St. GP Inc.; and the Metro North Project, 306-324 E. 100 St., New York, N.Y. — prime contractor Hobbs Ciena Associates LP and Hobbs Ciena Housing Development Fund Corp. The Metro North Project was funded in part by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The first two projects were subject to the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act of 1994. This law incorporates the provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act, which requires the payment of prevailing wages and benefits to laborers and mechanics employed on federal and certain federally-funded projects. The Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act, covering all three projects, requires contractors and subcontractors to pay laborers and mechanics on the projects one and one-half times their basic rate of pay for all hours worked over 40 in a week.

National Emergency Grants are awarded at the discretion of the secretary of labor based on a state's ability to meet specific guidelines. For more information, visit http://www.doleta.gov/NEG/ ."
"December 6, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20101206,"US Labor Departments OSHA extends comment period to March 21, 2011, announces stakeholder meeting on noise control interpretation","WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration today announced that it is extending by 90 days the official comment period on the proposed interpretation titled ""Interpretation of OSHA's Provisions for Feasible Administrative or Engineering Controls of Occupational Noise,"" which was published in the Federal Register on Oct. 19. Interested parties are encouraged to submit comments by March 21, 2011. The agency also announced that it will hold a stakeholder meeting before the end of the comment period to listen to the concerns of businesses and workers about the proposed noise interpretation. ""We're very eager to get input from those parties who would be affected by this proposed interpretation,"" said Dr. David Michaels, assistant secretary of labor for occupational safety and health. ""We have by no means completed our review of the issue and seek to make an informed decision that is in the best interest of protecting workers, yet sensitive to the operating changes businesses would need to make."" Thousands of workers every year continue to suffer from preventable hearing loss due to high workplace noise levels. Since 2004, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has reported that more than 125,000 workers have suffered significant, permanent hearing loss. In 2008 alone, BLS reported 22,000 hearing loss cases. Responding to continuing high levels of hearing loss among employees in the nation's workplaces, the notice proposed to make enforcement of the hearing conservation standard consistent with enforcement of other OSHA standards by clarifying the term ""feasible administrative or engineering controls"" as used in OSHA's general industry and construction occupational noise exposure standards. OSHA's current enforcement policy for noise exposures less than 100 decibels has not accurately reflected the noise standard's requirements that feasible engineering and administrative controls be used as the primary means of reducing noise exposure. Instead, OSHA has allowed many employers to rely upon a hearing conservation program, including the use of hearing protectors such as ear plugs. ""There is sufficient evidence that hearing protection alone cannot prevent workers from suffering preventable hearing loss,"" said Michaels. ""Easily applied administrative or engineering controls can and must be used to protect workers. There are plenty of employers out there who play by the rules and want to do the right thing, and we're hopeful we can work with them to craft a policy that's good for all."" Comments may be submitted online at http://www.regulations.gov . Alternatively, individuals may mail or deliver comments (three copies) to the OSHA Docket Office, Docket No. OSHA-2010-0032, U.S. Department of Labor, Room N-2625, 200 Constitution Ave. NW, Washington, DC 20210. Or, submissions not longer than 10 pages may be faxed to 202-693-1648. Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. OSHA's role is to assure these conditions for America's working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education and assistance.

"December 3, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20101203,Statement of Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis on November employment numbers,"WASHINGTON – Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis issued the following statement on the November 2010 Employment Situation report released today: ""This past November, nonfarm payroll employment increased by 39,000 jobs, and the unemployment rate increased to 9.8 percent. Furthermore, the job numbers for the months of September and October were revised upward 38,000. This year, we've seen the creation of 1.2 million private sector jobs – steady growth averaging 106,000 new private sector jobs each month. ""This private sector job growth, while positive, is not enough to keep up with the new entrants into the labor market each month, let alone create jobs for the 15 million unemployed workers. That's why we cannot forget the millions of Americans who, through no fault of their own, are still unemployed and looking for work. We still have a lot of work to do before we will have gained back everything that we lost in this recession. ""One way to bolster our economic recovery, and provide desperately needed support for the millions of Americans who continue to wake up every morning and look for work, is to reauthorize expiring Unemployment Insurance benefits. ""These benefits make it possible for unemployed Americans to keep looking for work, and we know that every dollar spent on UI generates $2 in economic activity. Letting these benefits expire will cost our economy half a percentage point in gross domestic product. Congress has a choice, and for the sake of our economy, Congress must reauthorize these expiring unemployment benefits without further delay. ""Today's numbers make clear the need to push sensible, effective and efficient ways to create jobs. Extending federal unemployment benefits now will help those who need it most and also will provide needed momentum for the economic recovery. It is not just the right thing to do for the unemployed; it is the right thing to do for everyone in America."""

The new model is now the eighteenth available from the Competency Model Clearinghouse, and can be accessed through the department's CareerOneStop website at http://www.careeronestop.org/competencymodel/default.aspx . Industry models are tools that help prepare and inform workers about the latest job requirements needed for success in the workplace. ""We are thrilled to be releasing this new competency model that will serve as a useful resource to help workers in the construction industry prepare for higher paying jobs,"" said Jane Oates, assistant secretary for employment and training. ""Through input from industry leaders and employers, we know that this latest tool will help workers become more competitive in the workforce."" Designed to evolve along with changing skill requirements, the model reflects the latest industry skill needs related to sustainability and green building practices. The model will help better educate workers for jobs with companies that are following green building practices. The model was developed by researching and analyzing publicly available resources, existing skill standards, competency-based curricula and certifications. The content was validated by representatives from industry associations, organized labor, educational institutions and employers to ensure that it clearly defines the knowledge and skills needed for today's construction worker. The Associated General Contractors of America led the validation process. ETA has now completed three construction industry-sector models demonstrating opportunities to use transferable skills to move through related career pathways.

"December 2, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ofccp/ofccp20101202,US Labor Department sues nations 2nd largest wholesale food distributor for discriminating against women -,"LUMBERTON, N.C. — The U.S. Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs today filed an administrative complaint against Nash Finch Co. for systematically discriminating against more than 80 qualified women who applied for order selector positions at the company's Lumberton facility. Nash Finch is the second-largest publicly traded wholesale food distributor in the United States and is based in Minneapolis, Minn. The company contracts with the federal government to provide goods and services to more than 200 military bases in the U.S. and overseas. ""It is unacceptable that a company which profits from lucrative federal contracts would repeatedly violate the law in this manner,"" said OFCCP Director Patricia A. Shiu. ""Nash Finch has demonstrated an unfortunate pattern and practice of hiring discrimination, and the American taxpayers should not have to bankroll this company's bad behavior anymore."" Order selectors at the Lumberton facility pull warehouse stock to fill customer orders. Under Executive Order 11246, federal contractors cannot discriminate in employment practices based on gender. However, data collected from Nash Finch during a six-month period showed striking hiring discrepancies. The company hired approximately 6 percent of qualified female applicants versus 26 percent of male applicants. The Labor Department's administrative complaint seeks remedies for the rejected applicants, including lost wages, benefits and interest for more than 80 affected class members, as well as job offers and retroactive seniority for at least 11 of the original applicants. Moreover, OFCCP is petitioning the Labor Department's administrative law judge to cancel all of Nash Finch's existing federal contracts and debar the company from entering into any future contracts until the violations are resolved and the company corrects its discriminatory employment practices. In addition to Executive Order 11246, OFCCP's legal authority exists under Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974. As amended, these three laws hold those who do business with the federal government, both contractors and subcontractors, to the fair and reasonable standard that they not discriminate in employment on the basis of gender, race, color, religion, national origin, disability or status as a protected veteran. For general information, call OFCCP's toll-free helpline at 800-397-6251. Additional information is also available at http://www.dol.gov/ofccp . Solis v. Nash Finch Co. Case Number: 2011-OFC-00004"
"December 1, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20101201,Statement by Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis on the extension of Unemployment Insurance benefits,"WASHINGTON – Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis today issued the following statement regarding the extension of Unemployment Insurance benefits: ""President Obama has said that Americans don't expect Washington to solve their problems, but they rightfully expect government to work for them – not against them. I agree. ""Over the last week, our federal legislators have had an opportunity to extend Unemployment Insurance – a critically important program that brings immediate returns to our economy while helping Americans who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own. But a lack of bipartisan support blocked the effort. ""To those who are standing in the way of this extension, I say: the time to put politics aside is here. The welfare of millions is at stake. ""If Congress fails to act on an extension of the UI program 2 million Americans will lose their unemployment insurance by the end of the year. And millions more could join their ranks in the coming months. As a nation, we simply cannot let this come to pass. ""In fact, our government has never cut off unemployment benefits this early in a recovery. By way of example, following the 1982 recession – during President Reagan's time in office – federal benefits were continued through the spring of 1985, after unemployment had fallen to 7.2 percent. There were good reasons for it then, and there are very good reasons for it now. UI benefits help those who need it most by putting food on the table and paying the bills. And, the return on investment on UI – 2 dollars in gained economic activity for each dollar invested in the program – is highly critical to our economic recovery.

Merritt, vice president of Bemcore Inc. of Dayton, has been sentenced by a federal district court in Ohio to five years’ probation and was ordered to restore $186,070 to his victims. The sentencing follows a guilty plea entered on Aug. 26 by Merritt to a one-count indictment of embezzlement from the company’s 401(k) retirement plan.

"November 29, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20101129-2,US Labor Department sues pension plans trustee of 2 defunct New York City garment companies to recover millions of dollars in misused assets,"NEW YORK – The U.S. Department of Labor has sued trustee Colette Mordo for alleged misuse of more than $4.6 million in plan assets of the Sadimara Knitwear Inc. and the Stallion Knits Ltd. defined benefit pension plans, in violation of her fiduciary duties under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The lawsuit is based on an investigation by the department's Employee Benefits Security Administration. Sadimara Knitwear Inc. and Stallion Knits Ltd. were garment companies headquartered in Manhattan. The companies sponsored the plans to provide pension benefits to their employees. ""Such flagrant misuse of pension plan assets is intolerable,"" said Phyllis C. Borzi, the Labor Department's assistant secretary for employee benefits security. ""The law clearly prohibits those entrusted with the assets of an employee benefit plan from intentionally misusing those funds to enrich themselves or their family members."" The lawsuit states that Colette Mordo, husband Matthew Mordo and son Alan Mordo were all participants in the plans, as were employees, officers and/or owners of the companies, which makes them parties in interest with respect to the plans. Matthew and Alan Mordo are both deceased. Colette Mordo also had ownership in two other companies, International Design Concepts LLC and Apparel Group International LLC, which are parties in interest because of her ownership. The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that Colette Mordo authorized the plans to make improper loans and transfers of plan assets over several years to parties in interest, including members of the Mordo family, and both International Design Concepts LLC and Apparel Group International LLC. The loans and transfers from both plans amounted to more than $4.6 million. The suit alleges that, between 2002 and the present, plan trustees and fiduciaries, including Colette Mordo, excluded eligible employees from participation in the plans and/or otherwise interfered with eligible employees' ability to accrue benefits under the plans. In addition, the suit alleges that she allowed participants who received benefit distributions from the plans to be paid less than they were entitled to receive. The department's suit asks the court to order Colette Mordo to restore all losses incurred by the plans, plus lost opportunity costs that resulted from her improper actions, and to permanently bar her from serving as a fiduciary to any ERISA-covered plan in the future. The suit also asks the court to appoint an independent fiduciary to administer these plans and to order the plans to offset any benefits owed to Colette Mordo against the amount she owes the plans. This case resulted from an investigation by EBSA's New York Regional Office. Employers and workers can contact that office at 212.607.8600 or call EBSA toll-free at 866.444.3272 for help with any problems relating to private sector pension and health plans.

The lawsuit alleges that the defendants withheld $23,537.53 in contributions from employees’ wages in 2006 and 2007 but failed to forward those funds to the 401(k) plan. Instead, the funds were co-mingled with the general assets of the company, and the defendants failed to restore to the plan the full amount of the un-remitted contributions plus the lost interest that would have been accrued if the funds had been properly deposited into the plan. “The Labor Department will not tolerate owners of this company misusing employee retirement contributions for corporate purposes rather than to provide retirement benefits to the plan’s participants,” said R.C. Marshall, EBSA’s regional director in Atlanta, Ga. The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida-Tampa Division, asks the court to order the defendants to restore all losses suffered by the plan, including lost interest and lost opportunity costs, and to offset the individual plan accounts of the defendants to repay any plan losses. The suit also seeks to permanently bar the defendants from serving in a fiduciary capacity to any employee benefit plan subject to ERISA and to appoint an independent fiduciary to oversee the plan at the defendants’ expense. GBK & Associates Inc. was an automotive equipment and tools sales company in Lakeland. This case is part of EBSA’s employee contribution project to safeguard workers’ contributions to 401(k) and health benefit plans and was investigated by the agency’s Atlanta Regional Office. Employers and workers can reach that office at 404-302-3900 or contact EBSA toll-free at 866-444-3272 for help with problems relating to private sector retirement and health plans.

"November 23, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20101123,"US Labor Department settles dispute with former Tampa, Fla.,  pharmaceutical corporation over retirement plan assets","TAMPA, Fla. – The U.S. Department of Labor has obtained consent judgments requiring Medipharm-Rx Inc. and two 401(k) plan administrators to restore more than $10,000 in losses incurred by the company’s 401(k) plan. The judgments follow an investigation by the Labor Department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration into alleged violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. In the lawsuit being resolved, the Labor Department alleged that the defendants failed to forward to the plan contributions deducted from employees’ paychecks, terminate the plan when the pharmacy ceased operations in January 2007, obtain an adequate fidelity bond for the plan and file required reports concerning the plan. Filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, Tampa Division, the consent judgments require that defendants Brian Green and Medipharm-Rx pay $10,153.57 to the plan for the benefit of plan participants and beneficiaries, and $2,030.71 to the Labor Department as a penalty. Additionally, defendant Grady Morrell will pay $2,030.71 to the plan for the benefit of plan participants and beneficiaries plus $1,500 to cover fees and costs of the successor fiduciary. Morrell also waived his right to receive restored contributions and interest to his plan account for calendar year 2006, estimated to be $1,069.40, and agreed to allow any interest he may have in any existing or future assets of the plan to be applied as an offset against the amounts due to the plan. All defendants agreed to be permanently barred from acting as fiduciaries of any plan covered by ERISA. Larry Lefoldt was appointed as successor fiduciary to the plan. “The Labor Department is pleased to resolve this case and have the defendants restore funds to the plan for the benefit of its participants and beneficiaries,” said R.C. Marshall, EBSA’s regional administrator in Atlanta, Ga. Employers with similar problems who are not yet subjects of EBSA investigations may be eligible to participate in the department’s Voluntary Fiduciary Correction Program. Participation requires employers to make workers whole but allows them to avoid EBSA enforcement actions and civil penalties as well as applicable excise taxes.

The lawsuit follows an investigation by the department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration into alleged violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The suit alleges that the company and its owner failed to forward $27,546.10 in employee contributions to the retirement plan in 2006 and 2007, and to appoint someone to carry out that task. In 2006, the plan loaned $16,508 to Roy Bordes, $9,500 of which was repaid by his estate. When the company ceased operations in 2008, the plan was not terminated and no one was appointed to ensure that the retirement assets were properly distributed to participants. “The Labor Department is filing this lawsuit to ensure that all assets owed to the Bordes Group 401(k) retirement plan are collected and distributed to their rightful owners – the employees,” said R.C. Marshall, EBSA’s regional director in Atlanta, Ga. Filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida-Orlando Division, the suit asks the court to order the defendants to restore all losses and to offset any claims of the defendants to plan assets against the losses owed to the plan. The suit also seeks to permanently bar the defendants from serving in a fiduciary capacity to any employee benefit plan subject to ERISA, and to appoint an independent fiduciary at the defendants’ expense to terminate the plan and distribute its assets. Bordes Group Inc. provided security consulting services and was based in Orlando. As of September 2010, the 401(k) plan had seven participants and $139,876.22 in assets.

"November 19, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20101119-0,MSHA puts 13 mines on notice for potential pattern of violations -,"ARLINGTON, Va. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration announced today that 13 mines from around the country received letters putting them on notice that each has a potential pattern of violations of mandatory health or safety standards under Section 104(e) of the federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. These are the first mining operations to receive such notification since MSHA implemented major reforms to its POV process, including tougher provisions for mines with chronic and persistent health and safety violations. A 14th mine, Upper Big Branch, met the criteria, but actions have been postponed until MSHA's investigation into the April 5 explosion is complete. ""I have been saying since I arrived at MSHA that the POV system is broken,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""This screening represents a positive step forward, but it won't be the only step. POV is on MSHA's rulemaking agenda, and there are also statutory changes pending before Congress that would further improve the system."" Main also noted that the review process is not finished. ""Once MSHA completes a thorough auditing, there may be more mines put on notice for a potential POV,"" he said. Audits are being conducted at mine operations that appear close to qualifying for a potential POV to track any underreporting of mine accidents and injuries. MSHA's screening process, which covers enforcement actions during the 12-month period ending Aug. 31, 2010, identified mines with an elevated rate of significant and substantial, or S&S, violations. It also identified those that have been subject to closure orders, including closure orders for serious issues such as failing to correct violations after MSHA cites them, unwarrantable failures to comply with health or safety standards, failure to provide miners with required training and imminent dangers in the mine. Under the new criteria, MSHA also considered whether a mine has a high percentage of S&S violations involving elevated negligence, as well as a mine's injury severity rate, targeting operations with an above-average injury severity measure. Mine operators can choose to institute a corrective action program with concrete, meaningful measures to reduce their S&S violations; achievable benchmarks and milestones for implementing the program; management oversight to ensure the program is being instituted and followed; and measures to find and fix the mine's specific compliance problems. Mines that implement a corrective action program will be required to meet the prescribed goals within a maximum of 110 days of receiving potential POV notification, depending upon when a corrective action program is submitted to MSHA. Operators that do not choose to implement a corrective action program will be required to achieve the prescribed goals set by MSHA within 50 days of receiving a potential POV notification. MSHA has established S&S violation rate-reduction goals for each mine that received a potential POV notification. In order to avoid receiving a POV notice, mines that do implement an appropriate corrective action program must reduce the S&S frequency rate per 100 inspection hours by 50 percent from the mine's rate during the 12-month review period, or to a rate within the top 50 percent for all mines of similar type and classification. Mines that do not implement an appropriate corrective action program must reduce the S&S frequency rate per 100 inspection hours by 70 percent from the mine's rate during the 12-month review period, provided such reduction is below the national rate for all mines of similar type and classification during the same period, or to a rate within the top 35 percent for all mines of similar type and classification. Previously, mine operators were required to achieve only a 30 percent reduction to avoid POV actions and were not required to meet benchmarks where corrective action programs were used. Mines that failed to meet the requirements would be subject to the POV, at which point every S&S violation would result in an automatic closure order until the violation was abated. Mines would remain on POV status until a complete inspection found the mine free of S&S violations. ""Along with impact inspections and injunction actions, POV represents an important enforcement method for MSHA to change the behavior of mine operators who don't take seriously the health and safety of miners,"" said Main. Editor's note: A complete list of the 13 mines can be found at http://www.dol.gov/opa/media/press/msha/20101119-PPOV-Mines.pdf . The applicable S&S frequency rate goals, POV screening criteria and procedures, and copies of letters sent to mine operators are posted on MSHA's POV Single Source Page at http://www.msha.gov/POV/POVsinglesource.asp ."

Solis today issued the following statement regarding the increased enforcement and outreach efforts of the U.S. Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division: ""Protecting worker rights is my top priority at the Department of Labor. It's not a slogan. It's a commitment that I have made to ensure workers receive all the protections that the law promises, and that no employer gains an unfair advantage by cheating workers out of their rightfully earned wages. ""Since I took office, the department has collected more than $300 million in back wages for more than 385,000 workers. I have hired an additional 300 new wage and hour investigators to ensure that we can promptly respond to complaints and can undertake more targeted enforcement. And I have launched a national public awareness campaign to connect America's most vulnerable workers with the broad array of services that are provided by my department to ensure they receive the wages they worked so hard to earn. ""We are making significant strides to combat wage violations, but there is still much work to do. We welcome the efforts of those who join us in educating the public about the need for more, and we want workers to know that they should contact us if they have any questions about the protections they are guaranteed under the law. ""I will not rest until the law is followed by every employer and until each worker is treated and compensated in accordance with what the law requires."""

"November 18, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20101118,MSHA launches 2nd phase of Rules to Live By enforcement initiative,"ARLINGTON, Va. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration today launched the second phase of an outreach and enforcement program designed to strengthen efforts to prevent mining fatalities. ""Rules to Live By II: Preventing Catastrophic Accidents"" was developed from data gathered by reviewing accidents that resulted in five or more fatalities, as well as from incidents caused by fires or explosions that had the potential to result in more fatalities. MSHA analyzed citation data from eight accidents at underground coal mines that took place between 2000 and 2009, and resulted in the deaths of 47 miners. These accidents occurred at Willow Creek, Jim Walters No. 5, McElroy, Sago, Aracoma Alma Mine No. 1, Darby Mine No. 1, R & D Coal Co. and Crandall Canyon. In developing the second phase of ""Rules to Live By,"" MSHA reviewed these accidents to identify conditions and practices contributing to the accident, safety standards violated, root causes and abatement practices. The April 5 explosion at the Upper Big Branch Mine is not included, but MSHA plans to update ""Rules to Live By II"" when the investigation of that accident is complete. ""Too many miners have lost their lives in catastrophic accidents over the past 10 years,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""That is simply unacceptable. ""The goal of 'Rules to Live By II' is to prevent major accidents – from fires to explosions – that could be disasters by having mine operators identify and correct all hazardous conditions, and direct MSHA enforcement toward confirming that violations relating to these standards and conditions are not present at mines. We are committed to scrutinizing the data on deaths in the mining industry and getting at the leading causes of those deaths to prevent subsequent ones,"" said Main. In its analysis of the violations contributing to one or more of the eight accidents, MSHA identified nine coal standards. The standards fell into one of four categories: explosions, aftermath of a fire, mining methods and examinations. MSHA is also focusing special attention on two other standards dealing with combustible materials and rockdusting to prevent coal mine fires and explosions. As with the initial 24 standards highlighted during the first ""Rules to Live By"" initiative, MSHA will begin with outreach to the mining community. Enforcement personnel will focus more attention on these standards through enhanced enforcement and increased scrutiny for violations of these standards. Inspectors will be instructed to carefully evaluate gravity and negligence, consistent with the seriousness of the violation, when citing violations of standards that may cause or contribute to mining fatalities. Information is also being sent to state grantees, who provide training to the mining industry. The first ""Rules to Live By"" initiative, launched earlier this year, focused on standards that were frequently cited in fatal accident investigations from January 2000 through December 2008. MSHA inspectors will begin enhanced enforcement efforts for the second phase on Jan. 1, 2011."
"November 18, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20101118,Statement by Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis on expanded Trade Adjustment Assistance program,"WASHINGTON – Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis today issued the following statement on the extension of the expanded Trade Adjustment Assistance program: ""Last year, through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, Congress made the wise decision to expand Trade Adjustment Assistance eligibility to service sector workers adversely impacted by trade. Prior to that, the program focused solely on workers in the manufacturing sector. The expanded program offers a crucial lifeline to many working families whose breadwinners lost their jobs through no fault of their own. ""In fact, between May 2009 and the end of September, more than 155,000 Americans who may have otherwise been ineligible for assistance were certified to receive the income support and training that they desperately needed. TAA benefits can help participants keep food on the table for their families, and training ensures they are prepared for new employment opportunities. ""Unless Congress takes action, however, the expanded TAA program will expire at the end of 2010. That could leave a great many trade-impacted workers across the country without needed support and services. And it would undermine the progress we are making as a nation toward economic recovery. ""It also merits underscoring that those who receive TAA have lost jobs through no fault of their own and many are actively pursuing training for new careers. In other words, these are experienced workers, firmly committed to putting in the effort to get back on their feet. As a group, they have strong work records, and they are a tremendous asset to our economy. Continuing to help them gain the skills needed to enter good jobs contributes to the overall health of our economy, and it just makes sense. ""As this issue comes to a head over the coming weeks, federal legislators will have an important choice to make. I urge them to keep in mind that America's families still need our help, to make the responsible decision and to extend the expanded TAA program. It is also my hope that Congress acts on our no-cost technical fixes to the TAA Community College and Career Training Program that will help this new program succeed and benefit a broader population of unemployed workers.""

The department’s Office of the Solicitor has filed a request with the department’s Office of Administrative Law Judges to hold a hearing to enforce the department’s findings against the Ellenton, Ga., agricultural employer. “Low-wage workers in every industry, including agriculture, deserve no less than to receive all the wages they have earned,” said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. “The Labor Department is committed to protecting the rights of all workers, including those under the H-2A temporary employment program who are working in our country.” Agricultural employers who bring temporary, non-immigrant workers into the U.S. to perform agricultural labor or services of a temporary or seasonal nature must meet requirements of the Immigration and Nationality Act with respect to pay, hours of work and other conditions of employment. Both temporary, non-immigrant farm workers and U.S. workers doing corresponding work are protected under Section 218 of the act. The Wage and Hour Division found that the vegetable farm allegedly failed to provide at least 75 percent of the hours promised in the work contract. The solicitor is asking that an administrative law judge order the farm to pay $1,311,644 in back wages to 148 U.S. workers and 96 H-2A workers plus pay a fine of $122,000. The investigation also discovered that the farm failed to provide a copy of the H-2A work contract at the time of recruitment to 29 U.S. workers who performed the same type of work as the H-2A workers. The Labor Department is recommending a fine of $14,500 for that offense. The Wage and Hour Division enforces worker protection laws that include the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Migrant and Seasonal Worker Protection Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act’s field sanitation and temporary labor camp provisions, and protections for guest workers with H-2A visas provided by the Immigration and Naturalization Act. This case was investigated by the division’s Atlanta Regional Office.

Borzi. The proposed regulation requires administrators of all defined benefit plans that are subject to Title IV of ERISA to provide an annual funding notice to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., each plan participant and beneficiary, each labor organization representing such participants or beneficiaries and, in the case of a multi-employer plan, to each employer that has an obligation to contribute to the plan. Prior to implementation of the Pension Protection Act, only multi-employer plans were required to disclose any funding information. An estimated 29,500 plans covering approximately 44 million participants and beneficiaries are subject to these disclosure requirements. Among other information, a funding notice must include the plan’s funding target attainment percentage or funded percentage, as applicable, over a period of time.

"November 17, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20101117,DOL announces 2011 Trade Adjustment Assistance initial funding allocations,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor today announced initial funding allocations for Trade Adjustment Assistance for states to assist workers who lose their jobs due to outsourcing and foreign trade. This announcement includes two funding levels for states under the program: one under the current, expanded level of authorized funding, and one at a reduced level that will take effect on Jan. 1, 2011, if Congress fails to renew the expanded TAA program authorized by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. If the expanded program is not renewed, states stand to lose approximately $267 million in initial allocations, and thousands of workers could be excluded from the program. Additional reserve funding would be lost as well. ""The Recovery Act has allowed us to serve more Americans through the Trade Adjustment Assistance program, giving workers access to essential services in a time of need,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""Returning TAA to pre-expansion funding levels and eligibility guidelines would leave a staggering number of workers in states across the country without access to this important program."" TAA provides workers with the opportunity to obtain the skills, resources and support needed to gain re-employment. Funds are used to provide career training, employment and case management services, and to pay for associated administrative costs. States will receive funds according to these allocations once the department receives its fiscal year 2011 congressional appropriation. The Recovery Act included a major expansion and reform of the TAA program, and authorized an increase in the maximum amount of TAA funds that may be used for training nationwide, from $220 million to $575 million. If Congress does not renew the expanded program before Jan. 1, 2011, funding will revert to pre-Recovery Act levels, and service industry workers will no longer be covered by the program. Funds announced today are the initial allocations for fiscal year 2011 for both the expanded and reduced levels. The remaining funds are being held in reserve by the Labor Department for distribution as needed throughout the year.

"November 17, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20101117-0,Statement by Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis on US Senate's failure to pass Paycheck Fairness Act,"WASHINGTON – Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis today issued the following statement after the Senate's failure to invoke cloture (by a margin of 58 to 41) on S. 3772 – the Paycheck Fairness Act: ""I am deeply disappointed that the Senate did not pass this important piece of legislation today. But, the issue of pay equity is far too important to give up. I remain committed to the fight for this commonsense reform, and my department will redouble its efforts to ensure America's women are not treated as second class citizens by employers who refuse to compensate them in a fair and equitable manner. ""While the Senate fell short of the mark today, it is important to note that the Paycheck Fairness Act was approved by the House of Representatives almost two years ago. The bill was specifically designed to address the persistent gap between men's and women's wages. It tackles that challenge by enhancing enforcement and by closing loopholes in the 47-year old Equal Pay Act. ""Since the passage of the Equal Pay Act in 1963, the issue of women's pay has grown even more serious. Today, women are the sole or co-wage earner in two-thirds of American households. And, for a growing number of families, equal pay for women is not just a matter of principle. It is a matter of survival. ""Most people are surprised to learn that, despite decades of efforts since 1963, the wage gap has narrowed from 59 cents for each dollar a man makes to a still unbelievably paltry 77 cents in 2010. It is equally shocking that the gap has closed only 5 cents in the past 20 years. At that pace, it will take almost 100 more years for women to achieve pay equity. The situation is even worse for women of color. In fact, today, African-American women make 69 cents for every dollar made by a man. Latinas make just 60 cents. ""Granted, when women enter the labor market, the wage gap is usually small, and some groups of women have earnings on par with men. But, the gap grows substantially as men and women progress in their careers. Men get larger raises and promotions. And, even when women keep pace with promotions, they still fall behind in pay. That has major long-term economic implications. And, by the age of 65, the typical full-time working woman has about $365,000 less in earnings relative to a full-time working man. This gap in earnings follows women into retirement, resulting in smaller pensions and lower Social Security. ""As President Obama has said, 'Equal pay is by no means just a women's issue – it's a family issue... And in this economy, when so many folks are already working harder for less and struggling to get by, the last thing they can afford is losing part of each month's paychecks to simple discrimination.' ""As a nation, we must continue to pursue pay equity with passion and determination. We owe it to women in America – those of years past, who worked so hard to build our country; those who carry that task on today; and, certainly, those who will shape our future in the workplace of tomorrow."""
"November 17, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20101117,US Labor Department obtains judgments against trustees of New York City- based pension plan for violating employee benefits law,"NEW YORK – The U.S. Department of Labor has obtained a judgment against trustee Samuel Kohl and default judgments against trustee Caren Kohl and Welko Inc. of New York City as fiduciaries of the Welko Inc. Pension Plan, permanently barring them from serving in a fiduciary capacity to any employee benefit plan covered by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The judgment orders the defendants to cooperate fully with the independent fiduciary and provide him with a full accounting of the whereabouts and amounts of all plan assets and liabilities. In July, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York granted the department a preliminary injunction barring the same defendants from conducting any business on behalf of the plan, and ordering them to turn over to the court all of the plan’s cash assets. The court appointed David Lipkin of Metro Benefits Inc. as the independent fiduciary for the pension plan with full authority to manage the plan, pay outstanding participant claims and terminate the plan if necessary. In addition, the judgment ordered the offset of any benefits due Samuel and Caren Kohl to ensure that plan expenses are satisfied and other plan participants receive their benefits. “The gross misuse of plan assets by the fiduciaries in this case is intolerable,” said Jonathan Kay, New York regional director of the department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration, which conducted the investigation leading up to this litigation. “We took legal action to ensure that the participants and beneficiaries of this pension plan obtained the benefits due them.” The Labor Department sued the defendants for breaches of fiduciary duties and causing the plan to engage in transactions prohibited by ERISA. The court found that the fiduciaries diverted plan assets to trustee Samuel Kohl, the plan sponsor Welko Inc., a now defunct jewelry business formerly located in New York City, Meglark Inc., a private wholesale diamond company, and AFBRI Ltd., a nonprofit research entity in Israel; failed or refused to pay fees on a Manhattan condominium owned by the plan that resulted in litigation, fees and a possible reduction in the property’s value; refused to distribute benefits to a qualified plan participant; and failed or refused to account for plan assets, income and losses. In addition, the court found that the Kohls used plan funds to purchase the Manhattan condominium unit and then housed their personal nanny in the unit while failing to collect rental income for the plan. The court further found that Samuel Kohl used plan assets to obtain a $250,000 home equity line mortgage but did not apply the proceeds to benefit the plan or its participants. The court further found that Kohl treated plan assets as his own funds under his belief that most of the plan’s vested benefits would accrue to him, in violation of ERISA requirements that a plan trustee deal with plan assets for the benefit of all participants and not for personal benefit.

"November 16, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20101116,US Labor Department study underscores positive impact of unemployment insurance,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor today announced the findings of a multi-year study of the impact of the Unemployment Insurance program in stabilizing the economy during a deep recession. The study was commissioned by the department and undertaken by IMPAQ International LLC and the Urban Institute. Using UI data and the proprietary economic model from Moody's Economy.com, researchers studied how gross domestic product, employment and other economic variables would have performed without the increase in regular UI benefits; federally-funded Emergency Unemployment Compensation; and Extended Benefits, including the offsetting effect of the payroll taxes that pay for UI. Thanks to the aggressive, bipartisan effort to expand UI benefits and increase eligibility during both the Bush and Obama administrations, the Unemployment Insurance program had an even more positive impact on the economy than in previous recessions. Among the key findings: For every dollar spent on UI, economic activity increases by two dollars. During each quarter of the recent recession, UI benefits kept an average of 1.6 million Americans on the job. At the height of the recession, UI benefits averted 1.8 million job losses and kept the unemployment rate approximately 1.2 percentage points lower. UI benefits reduced the fall in GDP by 18 percent. Nominal GDP was $175 billion higher in 2009 than it would have been without UI benefits. In total, unemployment insurance kept GDP $315 billion higher from the start of the recession through the second quarter of 2010. ""Unemployment insurance is one of the best investments we can make, not only for the millions of people that utilize UI benefits to provide for their families in a time of need, but for the millions more whose jobs are kept secure because of the stabilizing effect it has on our economy as a whole,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. Unless there is congressional action over the next few weeks, our unemployment insurance system will be drastically curtailed. Without continued support for the Emergency Unemployment Compensation and Extended Benefits programs, most people facing unemployment will have only 26 weeks of benefits available. ""Two million people stand to lose benefits before the end of the holiday season if Congress does not act to extend federal benefits. Four million more would lose benefits early in 2011,"" added Secretary Solis. ""While the economy and the job market are on the road to recovery, the loss of consumer sales from removing billions of dollars in unemployment benefits will set us back. Now is not the time to turn our backs on the families that rely on these benefits and the businesses that serve them.""

"November 16, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20101116-23,US Labor Department sues owner of defunct Mass. & RI company to restore more than $6.6 million in misused funds owed to company pension plan,"BOSTON – The U.S. Department of Labor has sued Fathalla M. Mashali, owner and president of the now defunct Northern Rhode Island Anesthesia Associates P.C. and its subsidiaries, for failing to forward more than $6 million in contributions plus interest owed to the company’s pension plan, in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The company operated subsidiaries throughout Massachusetts and Rhode Island. “The flagrant misuse of pension assets to subsidize corporate activities jeopardizes the retirement security of workers and will not be tolerated,” said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. “Our action today is designed to restore the plan assets that were not properly preserved for the company’s employees.” The lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts following an investigation by the Labor Department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration. NRIAA was a private corporation that performed administrative and billing functions for its various subsidiary corporations, primarily anesthesia and pain treatment practices, including: Blackstone Valley Emergency Physicians Associates P.C., Anesthetics of Massachusetts P.C., Northern Rhode Island Medical Group P.C., Helios Medical Group Inc., Northern Rhode Island Endoscopy P.C., New England Pain Associates P.C., Anesthetics of Lowell P.C., Anesthetics of Brockton P.C., Anesthetics of Worcester P.C., Anesthetics of Nantucket P.C., New England Cardiac Anesthesia Associates P.C., Anesthetics of Lawrence P.C. and Anesthetics of New Hampshire P.C. On Aug. 4, 2001, NRIAA established the Northern Rhode Island Anesthesia Associates Retirement Plan and Trust to provide retirement benefits for the employees of NRIAA and its subsidiary corporations that adopted the plan as participating employers. The company was the plan sponsor and administrator, and Mashali was the plan’s trustee. The Labor Department’s suit alleges that Mashali failed to take appropriate measures to collect and remit all employer contributions due to the plan, and to ensure that withheld employee contributions were properly forwarded to the plan account during plan years 2006 through 2008. The suit alleges that the contributions were diverted to benefit NRIAA, its subsidiaries and Mashali. As a result, contributions totaling $6,632,047.40, plus interest, are owed to the plan. Mashali filed for bankruptcy in December 2008. The department’s suit asks the court to permanently bar Mashali from serving as a fiduciary to this plan or any other employee benefit plan covered by ERISA, to require him to undo any transactions prohibited by law and to restore to the plan all losses with interest that resulted from breaches of his fiduciary duties. The suit also asks the court to require Mashali to appoint an independent fiduciary to administer the plan for the benefit of its participants. This case is part of EBSA’s employee contribution project to safeguard workers’ contributions to 401(k) and health benefit plans. Employers and workers can contact the Boston EBSA office at 617-565-9600 or toll-free at 866-444-3272 for help with any problems relating to private sector pension and health plans.

""Employees sacrificed wages to provide important benefits for themselves and their families,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""These enforcement actions underscore the Labor Department's commitment to ensure that these workers' contributions are protected and available to pay future benefits."" Under ERISA, the Labor Department has the authority to conduct civil and criminal investigations to protect employee benefit programs and the assets set aside to pay benefits to workers and their families. The enforcement cases announced today represent civil cases filed in federal district courts across the country to protect the contributions made by employees and matching contributions promised by their employers. In these cases, workers had contributions to their pension or health plans withheld from their paychecks, but the employers did not deposit those contributions in the plans. Instead, the employers kept the workers' contributions and used them for their own purposes or other purposes unrelated to the plans. The Department of Labor is represented in civil ERISA cases by its solicitor of labor, and these cases were filed by each of the solicitor's eight regional offices.

Gill for failing to forward $70,000 in employee contributions and loan repayments withheld from employees’ paychecks to the company’s 401(k) plan, in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut, followed an investigation by the Labor Department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration. The suit alleges that defendant Steven G. Gill allowed the company to withhold plan contributions from employee wages but then failed to forward those contributions to the plan during the period from 2002 to 2008. Gill and the company allegedly diverted employee contributions and participant loan payments for use by the company for purposes other than to pay benefits. At the time of the violations, Gill was the plan’s trustee and the company served as the plan administrator. “These defendants failed in their fiduciary duties when they allowed plan assets to be used by the company that sponsored the plan,” said Edward Maloney, EBSA’s acting regional director in Boston, Mass. “ERISA requires that plan assets be used only to benefit plan participants and beneficiaries.” The suit asks the court to order the defendants to restore all losses with interest incurred by the plan, undo any prohibited transactions and permanently prohibit Gill from serving as a fiduciary to any ERISA-covered employee benefit plan in the future.

The lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York following an investigation by the Labor Department's Employee Benefits Security Administration. The suit alleges that defendant Robert Sardina allowed the company to withhold plan contributions from employee wages but then failed to ensure that those contributions were forwarded to the plan during 2008. The department's suit also alleges that Sardina failed to ensure that mandatory employer matching contributions were made to the plan. Finally, the department's lawsuit alleges that Sardina's failures resulted in lost opportunity costs to the plan participants. In all, the suit seeks the restoration of $14,409.19 owed to the plan. ""In effect, these failures by the plan fiduciary allowed the legally prohibited use of plan assets by a party-in-interest, namely the company, which was the plan sponsor,"" said Jonathan Kay, EBSA's regional director in New York City. ""ERISA requires that plan assets be used only to benefit the plan's participants and beneficiaries, and not for any other purpose."" The suit asks the court to order Sardina to restore all losses incurred by the plan plus lost opportunity costs, to permanently prohibit him from serving as a fiduciary or service provider to ERISA-covered plans and to offset benefits due to Sardina against the amount he owes the plan. The department's suit also seeks appointment of an independent fiduciary to distribute any restitution paid by the defendant to the plan's participants and to terminate the plan.

"November 15, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/oasam/oasam20101115,US Labor Department streamlines federal hiring process,"Office of Personnel Management and other federal agencies discuss steps taken toward hiring reforms, simplified application process for job candidates WASHINGTON — Today, the U.S. Department of Labor joined representatives from across the federal government to mark the progress made over the past six months in streamlining the hiring process to modernize the federal workforce. Along with U.S. Office of Personnel Management Director John Berry and other agency leaders, Labor Department representatives discussed the steps the department has taken in implementing President Obama's hiring reform initiative. ""This hiring reform puts the Department of Labor in a better position to hire much needed talent,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""These reforms simplify the application process for job candidates and contribute to an efficient federal hiring system. Recruiting the most qualified candidates to ensure good jobs for millions of Americans is critically important to this administration and to our country."" On May 11, 2010, President Obama mandated a reform of federal hiring practices in order to achieve quality talent acquisition. In his memo, the president directed agencies to reduce the time it takes to hire an applicant, begin accepting resumes and simplify the hiring process overall. Over the next few months, OPM and the Office of Management and Budget will review the progress each individual federal agency is making in implementing reforms in the hiring process. Several elements of hiring reform at the Labor Department include convening a multi-agency task group to develop templates for standard, common-language job opportunity announcements; and developing a communications plan for hiring managers. Every day, Labor Department employees serve the American public by protecting workers, preparing them for new and better jobs, and ensuring the safety of America's workplaces. By making the federal hiring process more transparent, efficient and effective, the department will be able to attract and more quickly hire talented and diverse applicants to serve and protect American workers."

""Our children represent the future,"" said James Smith, director of the department's Wage and Hour Division Detroit District Office. ""Our goal is to foster safer workplaces and prevent injuries by ensuring that school officials, students and employers are aware of the laws that protect young workers. Working children must only be employed in safe jobs and for limited hours."" The Wage and Hour Division in Detroit has mailed YouthRules! information to 1,300 high and junior high schools for use by school principals and staff who issue work permits. Work permits are generally required by state law before a young worker can be employed in Michigan. Federal provisions restrict the number of hours individuals under 16 years of age are allowed to work and the times during which they can be employed. Minors may not work more than three hours on school days, eight hours on nonschool days, 18 hours in school weeks or 40 hours during nonschool weeks. The regulations detail that 14- and 15-year-olds may work during nonschool hours but no later than 7 p.m., or 9 p.m. from June 1 until Labor Day. ""The intent of the limitations on work hours is to give our teens their best shot at preparing for their futures. They accomplish that by first doing well in school and then balancing school with safe and appropriate work experiences,"" Smith added. YouthRules! is a public awareness campaign designed to bring teens, parents, educators and employers together to promote safe and rewarding work experiences for young workers. The campaign involves partnerships with state and federal government agencies, employer groups, trade associations and advocacy groups.

"November 9, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20101109,"Statement by US Labor Departments OSHA assistant secretary regarding data on occupational injuries, illnesses requiring days away from work in 2009","WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics today announced that the number of reported nonfatal occupational injury and illness cases that required days away from work to recuperate decreased by nine percent to 1,238,490 cases in 2009 for private industry, state government and local government. Additionally, BLS reported that the total incidence rate decreased by 5 percent to 117 cases per 10,000 full-time workers. BLS also reported that local and state government workers had much higher rates of injuries and illnesses requiring days away from work than workers in private industry. In response, Dr. David Michaels, assistant secretary of labor for occupational safety and health, issued this statement: ""Injuries and illnesses requiring time away from work to recuperate can be costly to both employers and employees alike, often resulting in lost productivity for employers and lost wages for workers. All employers, private and government, can use the data released today to focus on areas with high incidence rates, and find and fix hazards to prevent future occurrences. We are continuing our efforts to ensure that these data are complete and accurate, so that they will assist employers in that effort. ""The BLS report is significant in that, for the first time, it reports incidence rates for workers in state and local governments, half of whom work in states where public employees have no OSHA coverage. We find it very troubling to note that the rate among local and state government workers was 185 cases and 180 cases per 10,000 full-time workers, respectively. That compares with 106 cases per 10,000 full-time employees in private industry. Specifically, we see a high occurrence among many public employee occupations, particularly among transit and intercity bus drivers, law enforcement officers, emergency response workers, and nursing aides and orderlies. We are also concerned that musculoskeletal disorders continue for the second year in a row to comprise almost 30 percent of all workplace injuries and illnesses requiring time away from work. ""Although it is encouraging to see a reduction in the total number of days away from work for injuries and illnesses suffered by workers in 2009, we know that economic conditions may have weighed heavily on the decline. Specifically, a decrease in employment and total hours worked, especially in construction and manufacturing, has led to fewer workers exposed to safety and health hazards in the workplace. ""As the economy improves, more Americans back on the job could potentially lead to easily preventable work-related injuries and illnesses. OSHA's challenge, and therefore America's challenge, is to remain vigilant and keep the health and safety of America's workers a priority, for no job is a good job unless it's a safe job."""
"November 9, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ilab/ilab20101109,Statement of Deputy Undersecretary of Labor Sandra Polaski on carpets produced in India by child labor and forced labor,"WASHINGTON — Deputy Undersecretary of Labor Sandra Polaski today issued the following statement clarifying the U.S. Department of Labor's position on the use of child labor and forced labor in carpet production in India: ""Recently the Carpet Export Promotion Council (India's Ministry of Textiles) hailed 'the decision of the U.S. Department of Labor in deleting Indian carpets as a product produced by forced labor or child labor in violation of international norms..."" The Labor Department wishes to clarify that it has not made a final determination about whether carpets from India are produced with child labor, forced child labor or forced labor. ""The Department of Labor's Office of Child Labor, Forced Labor and Human Trafficking publishes and continues to update two lists. The first, the List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor, was mandated by the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2005. That list includes products the department has reason to believe are produced by child labor and/or forced labor in violation of international standards. The TVPRA list includes carpets from India under the categories of both 'child labor' and 'forced labor.' ""The second, the List of Products Requiring Federal Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, was mandated by Executive Order 13126. On Sept. 11, 2009, the Department of Labor released an initial determination in the Federal Register proposing an update to the list with 29 products from 21 countries, including carpets from India. The notice requested public comments for a period of 90 days. Public comments were received and reviewed by all relevant agencies and a final determination was issued on July 20, 2010, in the Federal Register . The final determination provides responses to the most commonly received public comments. The only difference between the 2009 initial determination and the 2010 final determination of the executive order list was that carpets from India was not included in the final determination. The Labor Department received a submission from the Carpet Export Promotion Council during the public comment period that suggested child labor may have been significantly reduced in the production of carpets in India in the formal sector. ""Given that child labor and forced labor often occur in informal production of goods, the Labor Department believes that more information is needed to make a final determination on whether carpets from India should be included on both of its lists. A Labor Department contractor is currently undertaking extensive research on child and forced labor in carpet production in South Asia, including India. We expect to receive information on the use of forced child labor on both registered and unregistered looms through this research and will wait until that time before making a final decision on the inclusion of carpets from India on the executive order and TVPRA lists.""

"November 8, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20101108,Oregon supermarket chain agrees to restore up to $8 million to C&K Market 401(k) plan under settlement with US Department of Labor,"EUGENE, Ore. – C&K Market Inc. of Brookings, Ore., has agreed to restore $3 million in cash plus interest and to sell property owned by the C&K Market Inc. 401(k) plan, among other steps, in order to make restitution for a series of imprudent loans made with plan assets in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. C&K Market operates approximately 50 supermarkets in southern Oregon and northern California. Attorneys in the U.S. Department of Labor’s Office of the Solicitor filed a lawsuit against C&K Market, together with a consent judgment agreed to by the company, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon in Eugene. “Employees of C&K Market are relying upon and deserve to draw pensions from the company’s 401(k) plan,” said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. “The steps taken by the Labor Department will help correct imprudent management of those funds by the people entrusted to protect the welfare of their workers.” The Labor Department’s suit alleged that plan trustee Douglas A. Nidiffer and former company officer Rex Scoggins made a series of loans and extensions of credits totaling $2,185,000 from the plan to Gregg W. Boice between Nov. 3, 1998, and January 2001, to develop Rogue Landing, a proposed resort on the Rogue River in Gold Beach, Ore. Boice defaulted on his plan loans on several occasions. On March 31, 2003, the Rogue Landing property was transferred to the plan in lieu of foreclosure on the property. The plan then assumed the costs of ownership of the property. The suit also alleged that the plan entered into an agreement with the owners of property adjacent to Rogue Landing to serve as consultants on the development and management of the resort property, and that it granted a right of first refusal option to another party to buy the Riverview Restaurant located on the resort property. Both of those actions were imprudent, according to the suit. In addition, the department’s suit alleged that the plan trustee approved a $40,000 loan from the plan to purchase a convenience store and gas station known as the John Day Market near Astoria, Ore. John Day Market was found to be contaminated by leaking underground fuel tanks, making the property unsellable. When the borrower defaulted on the loan, the plan foreclosed on the property, making the plan responsible for the costs of environmental cleanup. The Labor Department negotiated a consent judgment with the company prior to filing its lawsuit. In addition to the restitution, the settlement directs the sale of the plan-owned properties. Under the settlement, the 401(k) plan will recover no less than $4.5 million from any sale of the Rogue Landing property. Nidiffer also agreed to resign as a trustee to the 401(k) plan. The suit is based on an investigation by the Labor Department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration.

"November 5, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20101105,Statement of Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis on October employment numbers,"WASHINGTON – Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis issued the following statement on the October 2010 Employment Situation report released today: ""This past October, nonfarm payroll employment increased by 151,000 jobs, with 159,000 jobs added in the private sector. The unemployment rate remained unchanged at 9.6 percent. ""One year ago, I reported an unemployment rate of 10.1 percent – the highest rate we had seen since 1983. Since then, the actions taken by the Obama administration have lowered unemployment by half a point, reflecting in more than 1.1 million jobs created in the private sector this year. ""While the economy continues to grow, there is more work that needs to be done to get Americans back to work. Everyone agrees on the problem. Both parties must now come together to solve it. ""With millions of Americans still looking for work, now is not the time to cut key safety net programs like Unemployment Insurance. The Emergency Unemployment Compensation program is set to expire at the end of November. If that happens, 2 million people will lose benefits in December and 6 million by the end of next year. ""While we are on the path of job creation, we cannot forget the millions of Americans who, through no fault of their own, are still unemployed and looking for work. Safety net programs like the Unemployment Insurance program have long been known to be a cost-effective way of keeping families afloat during difficult economic periods, while also serving to boost the overall economy. ""With nearly five job seekers for every job opening, many people will necessarily have to rely on the Unemployment Insurance system until the economy returns to pre-recession levels. We should not allow Americans to suffer when they have done nothing wrong. ""Making progress on the very serious problems facing this country will require everyone to put politics aside and work together to continue to create jobs, grow the economy and provide temporary help to those who are looking for work. I look forward to playing a constructive role in that process."""

The judgment resolves the Labor Department's claims against Skinner and the company, who allegedly co-mingled and misappropriated $161,002 in plan assets, plus lost-opportunity income, in May 2006. The defendants allegedly used the money to pay expenses of the company and Skinner. Skinner and the company also allegedly did not remit $16,805, including lost-opportunity income, in employee contributions to the company’s retirement plan from Jan. 15, 2004, through May 31, 2005. Under the judgment, entered in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon, Skinner and the company will make restitution to the plan within 15 days of the court’s order on Oct. 25, 2010, and are permanently enjoined from acting as service providers or fiduciaries to any ERISA-covered plan.

"November 3, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20101103,MSHA asks for preliminary injunction against Freedom Energy Mining Co.,"ARLINGTON , Va. – In an unprecedented legal move, the U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration today filed with the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky a motion for preliminary injunction against Freedom Energy Mining Co.'s Mine No. 1. Located in Pike County, Ky., Freedom's Mine No. 1 is owned by Massey Energy Co. Section 108(a)(2) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 provides for injunctive relief against noncompliant mine operators who habitually violate health and safety standards. In this particular case, Section 108(a)(2) calls for an injunction because Freedom Energy is engaged in a pattern of violation of the mandatory health and safety standards of the Mine Act, which constitutes a continuous hazard to the health and safety of the miners at Mine No. 1. ""Freedom Energy has demonstrated time and again that it cannot be trusted to follow basic safety rules when an MSHA inspector is not at the mine,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""If the court does not step in, someone may be seriously injured or die."" ""Although this is the first time the department has utilized this legal remedy, it will not be the last,"" said Solicitor of Labor M. Patricia Smith. ""The solicitor's office will work closely with MSHA to ensure that we use every tool possible to keep miners safe."" According to the brief MSHA filed, Freedom Energy is engaged in a pattern of failing to examine and maintain critical areas of its mining operations as evidenced by the quantity and gravity of violations in four critical spheres of safety: failure to clear the mine of excessive accumulations of coal dust; failure to protect the roof, face and ribs from falls and maintain an effective roof control plan; failure to test and maintain electrical equipment in a safe working condition so as to protect against fire or explosion; and failure to effectively ventilate the mine of noxious and explosive gases. Freedom Energy Mine No. 1 lies in a particularly dangerous coal seam that liberates massive amounts of methane – approximately 1.8 million cubic feet every 24 hours – and is prone to roof falls. In the past two years, seven miners have been injured at this operation as a result of falling roof. Moreover, since Aug. 11, 2010, six major roof falls have occurred in the mine. During the eight regular inspections conducted between July 2008 and June 2010, MSHA issued 1,952 citations and 81 orders (including 53 (d)(2) orders this year) to Freedom Energy for violating critical safety standards including improper ventilation, failure to support the roof, failure to clean up combustible materials, failure to maintain electrical equipment and failure to conduct the necessary examination of work areas. On numerous occasions, MSHA district office officials have attempted to resolve serious safety issues at Freedom Energy, including meetings with upper mine management over recurring roof problems, ventilation and dust control issues, accumulations, electrical equipment maintenance and inadequate examinations. The inspections, citations and meetings with mine management have not resulted in changes in behavior. As such, MSHA is compelled to use its statutory authority to ask the federal court to temporarily shut down the mine until the safety issues are addressed. If the U.S. district court in Kentucky grants MSHA's motion as proposed for a preliminary injunction, Freedom Energy will be required to close its mine temporarily and take specific actions before it can re-open. Freedom must correct all hazardous conditions in its mine and establish a health and safety management program for approval by MSHA before resuming production. Under its safety and health management program it must, among other things, establish an effective training and communications program; ensure that high-level mine officials conduct additional examinations; take additional air readings in critical areas; withdraw all miners when violations are found and pay miners who are idled by such withdrawals."

North Carolina qualified for its full share of the funds available under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act by providing for a variety of provisions that assist recent entrants to the workforce, part-time workers and workers who become unemployed because of compelling family reasons. ""I am pleased to announce that North Carolina has made important updates to its UI program to better meet the needs of the modern workforce,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""North Carolina has strengthened its economic safety net by helping to broaden coverage to deserving workers who previously did not qualify for benefits."" The Employment Security Commission of North Carolina can use the funds to pay unemployment benefits or, if appropriated by the legislature, for administering its unemployment insurance program or delivering employment services. The Recovery Act made a total of $7 billion available in UI modernization incentive payments to states that include certain eligibility provisions in their UI programs. Each state can qualify for a share of those funds by showing that its law includes those provisions.

Toward that end, OSHA has sent a letter and fact sheet on ""Crowd Management Safety Tips for Retailers"" to the CEOs. In 2008, a worker was trampled to death while a mob of shoppers rushed through the doors of a large store to take advantage of an after-Thanksgiving Day Black Friday sales event. The store was not using the kind of crowd management measures recommended in OSHA's fact sheet, which is available online at https://www.osha.gov/OshDoc/data_General_Facts/Crowd_Control.html . ""Crowd-related injuries during special retail sales and promotional events have increased during recent years,"" said Assistant Secretary for OSHA Dr. David Michaels. ""Many of these incidents can be prevented by adopting a crowd management plan, and this fact sheet provides retail employers with guidelines for avoiding injuries during the holiday shopping season."" The fact sheet provides employers with recommended elements for crowd management plans. Plans should include having trained security personnel or police officers on-site, setting up barricades or rope lines for pedestrians and crowd control well in advance of customers arriving at the store, making sure that barricades are set up so that the customers' line does not start right at the entrance of the store, having in place emergency procedures that address potential dangers, and having security personnel or customer service representatives explain approach and entrance procedures to the arriving public. OSHA also recommends not allowing additional customers to enter the store when it reaches its maximum occupancy level and not blocking or locking exit doors. For a copy of the letter sent to the CEOs and a list of the retailers they represent, visit http://www.osha.gov/ooc/blackfridayletter.pdf .

"November 1, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20101101,US Labor Departments MSHA kicks off annual Winter Alert campaign,"Miners, mine operators urged to take precautions during colder months ARLINGTON , Va. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration kicks off its 2010 Winter Alert campaign today to warn miners and mine operators about the dangers colder weather can bring to the mining environment. Historically, statistics show that most coal mine explosions occur during the colder months. ""Conditions at underground and surface coal mines can change dramatically during colder weather,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""Miners and mine operators should always be mindful of the dangers and hazards they may face this time of year."" Low barometric pressures and low humidity, coupled with seasonal drying of many areas in underground coal mines, have contributed to the larger number of mine explosions during winter months. Other hazards include limited visibility, icy haulage roads and walkways, and the freezing and thawing effect on highwalls at surface mines. MSHA urges miners and mine operators at underground coal mines to follow safety checklists by ensuring there is adequate ventilation, applying liberal amounts of rock dust, conducting frequent and thorough examinations, and being familiar with emergency procedures to prevent coal mine ignitions and explosions. Miners also should be vigilant about keeping escapeways clear of impediments. Miners and operators of surface mines should examine the stability of highwalls, remove snow and ice from walkways, de-ice any equipment, and apply salt and sand liberally where needed. During their normal inspection duties, MSHA inspectors will distribute posters and hardhat stickers with the slogan ""Beat Winter Hazards, Win with Winter Alert"" to alert miners about potential risks."

The department will vigorously pursue violations of the law to ensure that plan assets are protected and available to pay future benefits to workers,” said Assistant Secretary of Labor for the Employee Benefits Security Administration Phyllis C. Borzi. The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, alleged the defendants misused plan assets of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local Union No. 99 Retirement Fund, and failed to obtain information sufficient to enable the trustees to prudently evaluate the propriety of the legal bills of the union’s retirement fund, annuity plan, health and welfare trust fund, and the apprenticeship and training trust. Named as defendants in the suit were current and former trustees John Badessa, Thomas Chabot, Robert Chatterley, Thomas Demers, Allen P. Durand, Ronald Leddy, Peter Leone, Jack Magee, William O’Rourke, John P. Shalvey, Jay Strauss, Arthur Watson and David Wyman. Since all of the defendants were considered to be parties in interest under the law, several were alleged to have dealt with plan assets for their own benefit or for the benefit of close relatives. Others were alleged to have violated ERISA by failing to obtain sufficient documentation or justification to properly evaluate the legal bills submitted by the plans’ attorneys, Rodio and Ursillo Ltd. of Providence, R.I. In addition, some trustees allegedly caused or permitted the retirement plan to pay out over $400,000 in unwarranted pension benefits by improperly allowing Local 99 members to receive pension credits for work at the Millstone Nuclear Power Plant in Connecticut. The judgment orders the defendants to pay $439,755.62 in restitution to the Local 99 retirement fund, investigate the qualifications of service providers to the plans, provide the service provider with complete and accurate information, and conduct a prudent and sufficient investigation to ensure that reliance on the service provider’s advice is reasonably justified under the circumstances. In addition, the defendants must ensure that adequate and accurate records are established and maintained by all service providers to the plans and the fiduciary defendants are barred from using their authority to pay a fee for a service in which the fiduciary has a personal interest.

The lawsuit alleges that Owen failed to remit employee contributions to the plan, remitted certain employee contributions late without interest and failed to segregate the plan’s assets from the general assets of the company. The alleged violations occurred from May 2003 through April 2006. “We will hold plan fiduciaries accountable when they jeopardize employees’ retirement savings,” said Mabel Capolongo, regional director of the department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration in Philadelphia, Pa. “They have a legal obligation to protect the interests of the participants they represent.” The company established the plan in April 2003 and has since ceased operations. Filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, the suit seeks to restore to the plan all losses and lost opportunity costs, permanently enjoin Owen from serving directly or indirectly as a fiduciary to any employee benefit plan covered by ERISA, and appoint an independent fiduciary to manage and administer the plan. This legal action resulted from an investigation conducted by EBSA’s Philadelphia Regional Office. Employers and workers can contact the regional office at 215-851-5300 or toll-free at 866-444-3272 for help with problems relating to private sector pension and health plans. In fiscal year 2009, EBSA achieved monetary results of $1.3 billion in pension, 401(k), health and other benefits for millions of American workers and their families. Solis v.

"October 26, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20101026,US Department of Labor approves standards for direct support professional occupation under national Registered Apprenticeship system,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor's Employment and Training Administration has approved national guidelines for apprenticeship standards for the occupation of direct support professional. These standards will enable employers to use ETA's Registered Apprenticeship program to train workers for careers in the long-term care sector of the health care industry. ""The direct support professional occupation represents an important segment of the health care workforce, providing assistance and support to persons with disabilities, the elderly and individuals with long-term illnesses,"" said Assistant Secretary for ETA Jane Oates. ""The establishment of these new guidelines creates a career pathway for health care workers that can be implemented throughout the country."" The standards were developed through ETA's Office of Apprenticeship at the request of the National Alliance for Direct Support Professionals and the American Network of Community Options and Resources. NADSP and ANCOR are partnering with ETA on addressing the need for quality, competency-based instruction models to help establish career pathways for the direct support professional occupation. The Registered Apprenticeship program utilizes a competency-based model that allows apprentices to earn interim credentials based on the demonstration of specific skills. Under the new standards, the Registered Apprenticeship program will provide direct support professional apprentices with on-the-job instruction to develop competencies in assisting people in need. The credentials and competencies to be achieved are based upon criteria for the NADSP national voluntary direct support credentialing program. Apprentices will have the opportunity to complete both the Registered Apprenticeship program and the NADSP credentialing program. For more information on the apprenticeship guideline standards approved for the direct support professional occupation by ETA's Office of Apprenticeship, see http://www.doleta.gov/oa/bul10/Bulletin_2010_31_NADSP_ANCOR.pdf ."
"October 25, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20101025-0,US Department of Labor announces continued re-employment assistance to support Minnesota workers impacted by defense industry layoffs,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor today announced a $64,499 National Emergency Grant supplemental award to continue to provide services to 198 workers affected by layoffs at BAE Systems Inc. in Fridley, Minn. ""Continued access to quality training and job search services is a crucial component in helping Minnesotans find re-employment in today's challenging labor market,"" said Jane Oates, assistant secretary for the department's Employment and Training Administration. These supplemental funds, awarded to the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development, will continue the delivery of re-employment assistance to the 183 workers included in the initial award, and will provide services to an additional 15 workers added after the project's initial implementation. Layoffs at BAE Systems Inc. occurred between June 2009 and June 2010, following the company's loss of a large U.S. Department of Defense contract for canon systems. On March 4, 2010, a $786,901 grant was awarded to provide assistance to the affected workers, including skills assessment, basic skills training, individual career counseling and occupational skills training. National Emergency Grants are part of the secretary of labor's discretionary fund and are awarded based on a state's ability to meet specific guidelines.

"October 25, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20101025,"US Labor Departments OSHA fines New Hampshire gun powder manufacturer $1.2 million, issues 54 citations after deadly explosion","WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration has issued 54 workplace safety and health citations with penalties totaling $1.2 million to gun powder substitute manufacturer Black Mag LLC, following an investigation into the causes of a deadly explosion in May at the company's worksite in Colebrook, N.H. The explosion took the lives of two workers who had been on the job for only a month. ""The fines levied here pale in comparison to the value of the two lives lost,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""Nonetheless, this was a tragedy that easily could have been prevented had the employer valued the health and safety of its employees. Employers should not sacrifice their workers' lives for a profit, and no one should be injured or killed for a paycheck."" On May 14, two workers and a plant supervisor were manufacturing a gun powder substitute known as Black Mag powder when the explosion occurred. The workers had been required to hand feed powder into operating equipment due to the employer's failure to implement essential protective controls. The employer also chose not to implement remote starting procedures, isolate operating stations, establish safe distancing and erect barriers or shielding – all of which are necessary for the safe manufacture of explosive powder. Additionally, the employer chose not to provide the personal protective equipment and other safety measures its employees needed to work safely with such hazardous material. OSHA cited the company with four egregious willful, 12 willful, 36 serious and two other-than-serious violations with total penalties of $1,232,500. ""Even after a prior incident in which a worker was seriously injured, and multiple warnings from its business partners and a former employee, this employer still decided against implementing safety measures,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for OSHA Dr. David Michaels. ""Unfortunately, we see this kind of disregard time and time again across industries. All employers must find and fix workplace hazards so these types of avoidable tragedies don't happen, and workers can return home safely at the end of the day."" The four egregious willful citations were issued for the failure to train each of the four workers involved in the manufacture of the gun powder substitute. In addition to the two workers killed and their supervisor, there was an additional employee who left the job nine days before the explosion. Willful citations are considered egregious when more than one worker is exposed to a single hazard. The citation issued for that hazard is then multiplied by the number of workers exposed. Other willful citations were issued for the failure to locate operators at safe locations while equipment was operating; separate workstations by distance or barriers and ensure that each worker was properly trained; provide adequate personal protective equipment, such as fire resistant clothing, face shields and gloves; safely store gun powder; and identify explosion hazards in the company's operating procedures. A willful violation is one committed with intentional knowing or voluntary disregard for the law's requirements, or with plain indifference to worker safety and health. Some of the 36 serious citations were issued for the failure to separate small arms ammunition from flammable liquids, solids and oxidizing materials by a fire-resistive wall or by a distance of 25 feet; establish and implement an emergency action plan and provide written procedures to manage changes; provide personal protective equipment including clothing, respiratory devices, protective shields and barriers for workers exposed to lead; train workers on appropriate protective equipment; train workers in electrical safety-related work; address hazards associated with exit routes; and address hazards associated with handling, storing and transporting explosives. A serious citation is issued when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known. The two other-than-serious violations are for a failure to perform respirator fit tests and to ensure that facial hair does not interfere with a respirator seal. An other-than-serious violation is one that has a direct relationship to job safety and health, but probably would not cause death or serious physical harm. To view all of the citations issued to Black Mag, visit http://www.osha.gov/dep/citations/blackmag.pdf . The employer has 15 business days from receipt of its citations and proposed fines to comply, meet with OSHA or contest the findings before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. This inspection was conducted by OSHA's Concord Area Office in New Hampshire; telephone 603-225-1629. To report workplace accidents, fatalities or situations posing imminent danger to workers, call OSHA's toll-free hotline at 800-321-OSHA (6742). Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. OSHA's role is to assure these conditions for America's working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education and assistance.

""Layoffs in the fishing industry constitute a serious crisis for this community,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""Just as we are committed to helping workers in other communities across the country, we will ensure these workers get the opportunity to acquire the skills needed to promptly enter good jobs that pay family-supporting wages and offer real opportunities for advancement."" Awarded to and operated by the Lummi Nation, this grant will assist fishermen dislocated as a result of the decline in sockeye salmon. The affected workers will have access to dislocated worker services, which may include basic skills training, individual career counseling and occupational skills training to help them transition to stronger areas of the tribal economy. The Lummi tribal development plan indicates that job opportunities are available in Lummi- and state-owned fish hatcheries, as well as metal fabrication, outboard motor repair and equipment parts businesses. Of the $3,390,568 announced today, $847,644 will be released initially. Additional funding up to the amount approved will be made available as the grantee demonstrates a continued need for assistance.

"October 21, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20101021,Statement of Labor Secretary Hilda L. Solis on reported decline in workplace injuries and illnesses,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics today announced that nonfatal workplace injuries and illnesses among private industry employers declined in 2009 to a rate of 3.6 cases per 100 equivalent full-time workers, down from a total case rate of 3.9 in 2008. BLS also reported a decline in the total number of cases from 3.7 million in 2008 to 3.3 million in 2009. Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis issued the following statement: ""While the reported decline in workplace injuries and illnesses is encouraging, 3.3 million workplace injuries and illnesses are 3.3 million too many. No worker should fear being injured or made sick for a paycheck. ""Complete and accurate workplace injury records can serve as the basis for employer programs to investigate injuries and prevent future occurrences. Most employers understand this and do their best to prevent worker injuries, but some do not. That is why my department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration is aggressively working to ensure the completeness and accuracy of injury data compiled by the nation's employers. We are concerned about the widespread existence of programs that discourage workers from reporting injuries, and we will continue to issue citations and penalties to employers that intentionally under-report workplace injuries. ""Too many Americans suffer each year from preventable injuries or illnesses they received while on the job. Even in these difficult economic times, we must keep in mind that no job is a good job unless it's a safe job."""

"October 21, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ofccp/ofccp20101021,"US Labor Department settles hiring discrimination case with Tyson Refrigerated Processed Meats in Vernon, Texas","VERNON , Texas — The U.S. Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs has announced that Tyson Refrigerated Processed Meats Inc. has agreed to settle findings of hiring discrimination against 157 African-American and 375 Caucasian applicants for laborer positions at the company's bacon processing plant in Vernon. ""The Labor Department is committed to leveling the playing field for all workers,"" said OFCCP Director Patricia A. Shiu. ""A company that profits from taxpayer dollars must not discriminate, period."" OFCCP investigators found that African-American and Caucasian applicants were less likely to be hired than similarly situated Hispanic applicants over a two-year period. Under the terms of the conciliation agreement, Tyson Refrigerated Processed Meats will pay a total of $560,000 in back pay and interest to the 532 applicants. Additionally, the company will make job offers to 59 of the 532 eligible class members as laborer positions become available and revise the practices, policies and procedures it uses to recruit, track and hire applicants to fully comply with the law and immediately correct discriminatory practices. This agreement follows litigation by OFCCP involving two other subsidiaries of Tyson Foods Inc. In 2008, a Labor Department administrative law judge found that TNT Crust in Green Bay, Wis., systematically discriminated against Hispanic applicants in its hiring. In September 2010, OFCCP filed an administrative complaint against a Tyson Fresh Meats plant in Joslin, Ill., for systematically rejecting female applicants seeking entry-level positions.

Jeanneret Associates Inc. and the principals of the four companies for causing dozens of pension, health and other employee benefit plan clients to lose hundreds of millions of dollars through investments with Bernard L. Madoff and his firm. Also named in the lawsuit are Joel Danziger and Harris Markhoff of Beacon and Andover, Lawrence Simon and Howard Wohl of Ivy, and John Jeanneret and Paul Perry of J.P. Jeanneret. The defendants provided advice and investment services to the plans. The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that the defendants violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act by recommending, making and maintaining investments with Madoff, resulting in the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars of ERISA-covered plan assets. The suit also alleges that the defendants failed to take prudent actions to investigate or monitor Madoff and his purported trading and to disclose the extent of the known risks, irregularities and suspected ""red flags"" surrounding Madoff's operation. Additionally, the suit alleges that the defendants failed to protect the plans' interests while collecting tens of millions of dollars in fees for themselves as a result of the Madoff investments. According to the suit, plan investments were made with Madoff through direct investment and indirectly through the Jeanneret, Beacon and Andover funds that invested with Madoff. The suit further alleges that the Jeanneret defendants improperly received higher fees on the Madoff investments than other investments. As relief, the suit seeks to require the defendants to restore all losses suffered by the plans and to return any fees and profits improperly received as a result of plan investments with Madoff. It also seeks to permanently bar them from serving in a fiduciary capacity to any plan governed by ERISA in the future. ""These defendants chose their own financial interests over those of the plans whose assets they were duty bound to manage prudently. Their actions put the future benefits of thousands of workers in jeopardy,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. The case was investigated by the New York and Boston regional offices of the Employee Benefits Security Administration, an agency of the U.S. Department of Labor, and the lawsuit was brought by the department's Solicitor of Labor's Plan Benefits Security Division.

"October 21, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20101021,US Labor Department proposes rule defining 'fiduciaries' of employee benefit plans,"Washington – The U.S. Department of Labor's Employee Benefits Security Administration today announced a proposed rule to update the definition of ""fiduciary"" to more broadly define the term as a person who provides investment advice to plans for a fee or other compensation. The department's proposed rule would amend a 1975 regulation that defines when a person providing investment advice becomes a fiduciary under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The proposed amendment would update that definition to take into account changes in the expectations of plan officials and participants who receive advice, as well as the practices of investment advice providers. According to the proposal, the 1975 rule's approach to fiduciary status may inappropriately limit the department's ability to protect plans, participants and beneficiaries from conflicts of interest that may arise from today's diverse and complex fee practices in the retirement plan services market. The proposed rule is designed to remedy this limitation, and protect plan officials and participants who expect unbiased advice, by giving a broader and clearer understanding of when individuals providing such advice are subject to ERISA's fiduciary standards. ""The proposal will ensure that plans receive advice based on reliable information that protects the interests of plan participants and beneficiaries,"" said Phyllis C. Borzi, assistant secretary of labor for EBSA. ""We believe that this proposal more closely reflects the statutory language of ERISA and the realities of the current investment marketplace, and therefore will ensure those who provide investment advice are held accountable as fiduciaries under the law."" The proposed regulation will be published in the Federal Register on Oct. 22, 2010. For a copy of the proposed regulation, visit http://www.dol.gov/ebsa .

"October 19, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20101019,MSHA issues more than 550 violations during September impact inspections,"ARLINGTON, Va. The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration today announced that federal inspectors issued 499 citations, 61 orders and three safeguards during special impact inspections conducted at 15 coal and 15 metal/nonmetal mine operations last month. These concentrated inspections, which began in force last April following the explosion at Upper Big Branch Mine, target mines that merit increased agency attention and enforcement due to their poor compliance history or particular compliance concerns, including high numbers of violations or closure orders; indications of operator tactics, such as advance notification of inspections that prevent inspectors from observing violations; frequent hazardous complaints or hotline calls; plan compliance issues; inadequate workplace examinations; a high number of accidents, injuries or illnesses; fatalities; and adverse conditions such as increased methane liberation, faulty roof conditions and inadequate ventilation. During this most recent round of impact inspections, MSHA coal inspectors issued 275 citations, 53 orders and three safeguards, while metal/nonmetal inspectors issued 224 citations and eight orders. ""We are continuing to find serious threats to miners' safety and health,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""While some operators are finally getting the message, others are not,"" he said, referencing the Sept. 28 impact inspection at Elk Run Coal Co.'s Seng Creek Powellton Mine, in which MSHA issued 11 closure orders when inspectors found the mine operating without proper ventilation. Such practices can lead to mine explosions and black lung disease. The Sapphire Coal Co., Advantage No.1 Mine in Letcher County, Ky., is an example of a mine where violations were found. On Aug. 31 and Sept. 1, MSHA inspectors conducted a targeted conveyor belt inspection at the mine. After capturing the mine phone, inspectors issued 42 citations, eight orders and one safeguard. Among the violations was an order issued for the misalignment of a conveyor belt. This condition, if uncorrected, could have led to a mine fire. Seven of the orders and seven citations were issued for accumulations of combustible materials which, if left unchecked and in concert with other conditions, could potentially cause a mine fire or explosion. On Sept. 9, an inspection party arrived during the evening shift at Left Fork Mining Co. Inc.'s Straight Creek #1 Mine in Bell County, Ky. They captured and monitored the phones to ensure that no advance notification was relayed to miners underground. (This mine was cited for notifying mining personnel that MSHA inspectors were on site during a previous impact inspection last April and subsequently received an injunction in federal court.) Inspectors issued 28 citations and 11 orders for violations of the operator's roof control plan, not maintaining equipment, improper guarding, electrical infractions and permissibility (which protects against mine explosions). Violations also were issued for inadequate examinations, lack of ventilation controls, not following the mine ventilation plan, accumulations of combustible materials and other conditions. During the next regular safety and health inspection at the mine on Oct. 14, MSHA found more violations for accumulations along the conveyer belt, requiring the belt to be shut down and effectively closing the mine to production. The order was terminated after the mine operator cleaned and rock-dusted the conveyor belt. Accumulations of combustible materials and methane expose miners to an increased risk to a potential explosion or mine fire. ""Mine operators are obligated to address all the problems that MSHA inspectors identify, yet some continue to violate standards and place miners at risk,"" said Main. ""We will continue to target them and other operations that ignore fundamental safety and health laws. At the same time, we are beginning to see signs of improvement at some mines, an indication that these impact inspections are making a difference.""

The information for these facilities was made available online to the public at http://www.sem.dol.gov this month, bringing the total number of facilities in the enhanced version of the website to 92 of the 116 DOE facilities covered under the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act. The enhancements to the SEM website began in May of this year with an initial release of information on 48 sites, followed by an additional 21 sites released in July. The more robust public version of the SEM website provides additional ways to look for information regarding toxic substances at DOE nuclear weapons facilities covered under Part E of the EEOICPA. The enhanced SEM website contains more data and allows users to more easily identify interrelationships among DOE buildings, work processes, labor categories and exposure to toxic substances. In addition to exposure data, the SEM database contains information documenting confirmed causal relationships between certain toxic substances and diagnosed medical conditions. ""We appreciate the Department of Energy's agreement to make 92 of its sites fully accessible,"" said Shelby Hallmark, director of the Labor Department's Office of Workers' Compensation Programs. ""We'll keep working with that department until all our claimants are able to access the same type of data examiners use when evaluating Part E claims."" Initially, the full SEM database was only available internally within the Labor Department due to DOE's concerns with national security. Through extensive discussions and collaboration between the two departments, the public now has access to a granular level SEM database. Part E of the EEOICPA provides federal compensation and medical benefits to DOE contractors and subcontractors who worked at certain DOE facilities and sustained an occupational illness as a result of exposure to toxic substances. Certain survivors of these workers are also eligible for benefits. Following the enactment of Part E in 2004, the Labor Department launched an effort to create the SEM database to assist claimants in substantiating their Part E claims. The Labor Department continues to expand the database as new information is received and is always interested in obtaining new information to supplement and enhance the SEM database.

"October 14, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20101014,MSHA issues proposed rule on lowering miners exposure to respirable coal dust,"Aim is to end black lung disease among miners ARLINGTON, Va. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration today announced the release of a proposed rule on lowering miners' exposure to respirable coal dust in all underground and surface coal mines. The proposed rule is the latest element of MSHA's ""End Black Lung – Act Now"" campaign. The proposed rule combines prior regulatory actions addressing lowering coal mine dust exposure, single sample, plan verification and the use of continuous personal dust monitors. It would also implement recommendations contained in the 1995 National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health report, as well as a 1996 secretary of labor's dust advisory committee report. The NIOSH report can be accessed electronically at www.cdc.gov/niosh/95-106.html, and the dust advisory committee report can be accessed at www.msha.gov/S&HINFO/BlackLung/1996Dust AdvisoryReport.pdf . The proposed rule would lower the existing concentration limits for respirable coal mine dust from 2 milligrams of dust per cubic meter of air, or 2 mg/m , to 1 mg/m over a 24-month phase-in period; require the use of the continuous personal dust monitor; provide for the use of a single, full-shift sample to determine compliance; address extended work shifts; and redefine normal production shifts. In addition, the proposed rule would require expanded medical surveillance so that miners can take proactive steps to better manage their health. A fact sheet on the proposed rule is posted on the MSHA website, www.msha.gov . ""Protecting miners' health is a priority of the Department of Labor,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""This proposed rule takes concrete steps to end the terrible disease of black lung and will improve miners' lives."" Based on recent data from NIOSH, cases of black lung are increasing among the nation's coal miners. Even younger miners are showing evidence of advanced and debilitating lung disease from excessive dust exposure. Over the past decade, more than 10,000 miners have died from black lung. The federal government has paid out more than $44 billion in compensation for miners totally disabled by black lung since 1970, according to the Labor Department's Office of Workers' Compensation Programs. ""This proposed regulatory action fulfills a longstanding commitment and promise that I made on my first day with MSHA, and one to which I have been dedicated most of my working life,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""It would bring us many steps closer to overhauling an outdated program that has failed to adequately protect miners from breathing unhealthy levels of coal mine dust and achieving the intent of Congress to eliminate black lung disease."" The complete proposed rule may be viewed at www.dol.gov/opa/media/press/opa/OPA2010-FR-MSHA.pdf and will be published in the Federal Register on Oct. 19.

End Black Lung Campaign Endorsement Quote Sheet ""In America in the 21st century, workers should not have to risk illness or death in order to provide for their families, yet more than 10,000 miners with black lung disease have died in the last decade alone. This rule will provide today's miners with long-overdue protections against needless threats to their health."" Vice President Joseph Biden ""We work very hard to care for those who suffer from this debilitating, disabling, and often fatal disease, knowing full well that it is 100 percent preventable. This disease should not exist in this 21st century and are therefore strongly in support of the new initiative that MSHA has begun to 'End Black Lung Now.' We support MSHA's plans to strengthen and redesign the rules for respirable coal mine dust in our nation's mines."" Robert Cohen MD, medical director, National Coalition of Black Lung and Respiratory Disease Clinics ""As a pulmonary physician working in a coal mining region, I know too well the terrible human toll of dust-induced lung diseases for coal miners and their families. And recent research studies and health surveillance examinations have demonstrated increasing numbers of miners who are affected, and at strikingly young ages. The health protections that have been promised in the federal regulations have not been delivered, and thousands of miners are suffering severe, disabling and fatal lung disease. I strongly encourage the adoption of more effective measures to control dust exposures and to stop these entirely preventable illnesses and deaths among our nation's working men and women."" Edward L. Petsonk MD, professor, West Virginia University ""I continue to see miners (as patients) with serious and life threatening lung disease from coal mining. The fulfillment of the promise to eliminate these diseases is long overdue. I am supportive of the MSHA 'End Black Lung Campaign' and favor rulemaking efforts to modify the current regulations to better protect miners."" John E. Parker MD, chief of pulmonary and critical care medicine, West Virginia University ""What we are seeing today is that our miners are getting sicker and having to stop work at a much younger age due to complicated black lung disease. Many look considerably older than their actual age, they tell us stories of how they used to hunt, fish and walk the hills of our beautiful mountains, feeding their livestock, but they can no longer do the activities they always loved. The faces are different, but for the most part their stories and symptoms are the same. I say we must end this dreadful disease that has taken so many lives. We of the National Coalition of Black Lung and Respiratory Disease Clinics fully support MSHA's Campaign on Lowering Miners' Exposure to Coal Mine Dust including Continuous Personal Dust Monitors, and commend Mr. Main's efforts in addressing this terrible disease."" Ron Carson, Chair, National Coalition of Black Lung and Respiratory Disease Clinics ""I and we, as the National Black Lung Association, support any changes MSHA can make to prevent miners from getting black lung. I know first hand what black lung can do to an individual and to his family and we don't want that for any miner."" Joe Massie, president, National Black Lung Association ""We have seen firsthand the adverse effects on life and health that exposures to coal mine dust and silica have had on our patients. Of particular concern to us is the recent increase in prevalence of all forms of coal workers' pneumoconiosis, including progressive massive fibrosis. We are delighted to support the Mine Safety and Health Administration's plans to strengthen the rules for respirable coal mine dust exposure, including a long overdue decrease in the allowable exposure limit and improved efforts to measure and control hazardous exposures. These improvements in coal mine dust regulations are essential to the prevention of coal workers' pneumoconiosis, silicosis and other health effects suffered by miners in our country."" Cecile Rose MD, director of the Miners Clinic of Colorado ""Based on the stories we hear during our visits, coal miners are afraid to speak out because their job, their livelihood could be in peril. Protections promised in previous years are not there for this working class. I can also confirm that the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health's recent data suggesting that there is a higher incidence of simple pneumoconiosis and more severe disease in younger miners is what we are witnessing in the Black Lung clinics... As always, we will continue to educate the miners that present to our facility that prevention is imperative, and as health care workers we would love the see the elimination of this devastating disease. You have the full support of our staff. Thank you for continuing to make it a priority to protect our patients and our family members in the coal industry."" Susie J. Criss, director, Black Lung Program, New River Breathing Center ""The experience in this clinical setting is that more miners are getting massive pulmonary fibrosis or complicated black lung. This increase in complicated black lung is a national trend reported by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health. Workers with this form of black lung continue to become more and more disabled even after they are removed from the dusty environments of their jobs. Anything we can do to prevent the continuation of this disease needs to be done now. I will support any and all measures that will eliminate black lung."" Deborah L. Wills, Black Lung Program, Valley Health Systems Inc. ""We continue to treat and assist miners every day, most with black lung disease and many disabled from this disease. Black lung disease is not a disease of the past but continues to affect our nation's miners in Pennsylvania and indeed throughout the country. I support these standards as a way to finally end this entirely preventable disease. NIOSH recommended reducing the PEL by half more than a decade ago, but this was never implemented. This is a grave disservice to this hardworking population without whom more than half of our country would be without electricity. Recent NIOSH studies show that the failure to establish more stringent respirable dust standards has taken a large toll on coal miners as they have identified a resurgence of the disease in the past decade with younger miners becoming ill with more severe disease.

"October 14, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20101014,MSHA issues proposed rule on lowering miners exposure to respirable coal dust,"Aim is to end black lung disease among miners ARLINGTON, Va. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration today announced the release of a proposed rule on lowering miners' exposure to respirable coal dust in all underground and surface coal mines. The proposed rule is the latest element of MSHA's ""End Black Lung – Act Now"" campaign. The proposed rule combines prior regulatory actions addressing lowering coal mine dust exposure, single sample, plan verification and the use of continuous personal dust monitors. It would also implement recommendations contained in the 1995 National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health report, as well as a 1996 secretary of labor's dust advisory committee report. The NIOSH report can be accessed electronically at www.cdc.gov/niosh/95-106.html, and the dust advisory committee report can be accessed at www.msha.gov/S&HINFO/BlackLung/1996Dust AdvisoryReport.pdf . The proposed rule would lower the existing concentration limits for respirable coal mine dust from 2 milligrams of dust per cubic meter of air, or 2 mg/m , to 1 mg/m over a 24-month phase-in period; require the use of the continuous personal dust monitor; provide for the use of a single, full-shift sample to determine compliance; address extended work shifts; and redefine normal production shifts. In addition, the proposed rule would require expanded medical surveillance so that miners can take proactive steps to better manage their health. A fact sheet on the proposed rule is posted on the MSHA website, www.msha.gov . ""Protecting miners' health is a priority of the Department of Labor,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""This proposed rule takes concrete steps to end the terrible disease of black lung and will improve miners' lives."" Based on recent data from NIOSH, cases of black lung are increasing among the nation's coal miners. Even younger miners are showing evidence of advanced and debilitating lung disease from excessive dust exposure. Over the past decade, more than 10,000 miners have died from black lung. The federal government has paid out more than $44 billion in compensation for miners totally disabled by black lung since 1970, according to the Labor Department's Office of Workers' Compensation Programs. ""This proposed regulatory action fulfills a longstanding commitment and promise that I made on my first day with MSHA, and one to which I have been dedicated most of my working life,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""It would bring us many steps closer to overhauling an outdated program that has failed to adequately protect miners from breathing unhealthy levels of coal mine dust and achieving the intent of Congress to eliminate black lung disease."" The complete proposed rule may be viewed at www.dol.gov/opa/media/press/opa/OPA2010-FR-MSHA.pdf and will be published in the Federal Register on Oct. 19. Comments may be submitted electronically at the federal e-rulemaking portal www.regulations.gov , by mail at MSHA, 1100 Wilson Blvd., Arlington, VA 22209-3939 or by fax to 202-693-9441.

Listen to today's conference call with Secretary Hilda Solis, Assistant Secretary of MSHA Joe Main and Deputy Assistant Secretary of MSHA Dr. Gregory Wagner Editor's note: A list of quotations in support of the proposed rule follows this release. End Black Lung Campaign Endorsement Quote Sheet ""In America in the 21st century, workers should not have to risk illness or death in order to provide for their families, yet more than 10,000 miners with black lung disease have died in the last decade alone. This rule will provide today's miners with long-overdue protections against needless threats to their health."" Vice President Joseph Biden ""We work very hard to care for those who suffer from this debilitating, disabling, and often fatal disease, knowing full well that it is 100 percent preventable. This disease should not exist in this 21st century and are therefore strongly in support of the new initiative that MSHA has begun to 'End Black Lung Now.' We support MSHA's plans to strengthen and redesign the rules for respirable coal mine dust in our nation's mines."" Robert Cohen MD, medical director, National Coalition of Black Lung and Respiratory Disease Clinics ""As a pulmonary physician working in a coal mining region, I know too well the terrible human toll of dust-induced lung diseases for coal miners and their families. And recent research studies and health surveillance examinations have demonstrated increasing numbers of miners who are affected, and at strikingly young ages. The health protections that have been promised in the federal regulations have not been delivered, and thousands of miners are suffering severe, disabling and fatal lung disease. I strongly encourage the adoption of more effective measures to control dust exposures and to stop these entirely preventable illnesses and deaths among our nation's working men and women."" Edward L. Petsonk MD, professor, West Virginia University ""I continue to see miners (as patients) with serious and life threatening lung disease from coal mining. The fulfillment of the promise to eliminate these diseases is long overdue. I am supportive of the MSHA 'End Black Lung Campaign' and favor rulemaking efforts to modify the current regulations to better protect miners."" John E. Parker MD, chief of pulmonary and critical care medicine, West Virginia University ""What we are seeing today is that our miners are getting sicker and having to stop work at a much younger age due to complicated black lung disease. Many look considerably older than their actual age, they tell us stories of how they used to hunt, fish and walk the hills of our beautiful mountains, feeding their livestock, but they can no longer do the activities they always loved. The faces are different, but for the most part their stories and symptoms are the same. I say we must end this dreadful disease that has taken so many lives. We of the National Coalition of Black Lung and Respiratory Disease Clinics fully support MSHA's Campaign on Lowering Miners' Exposure to Coal Mine Dust including Continuous Personal Dust Monitors, and commend Mr. Main's efforts in addressing this terrible disease."" Ron Carson, Chair, National Coalition of Black Lung and Respiratory Disease Clinics ""I and we, as the National Black Lung Association, support any changes MSHA can make to prevent miners from getting black lung. I know first hand what black lung can do to an individual and to his family and we don't want that for any miner."" Joe Massie, president, National Black Lung Association ""We have seen firsthand the adverse effects on life and health that exposures to coal mine dust and silica have had on our patients. Of particular concern to us is the recent increase in prevalence of all forms of coal workers' pneumoconiosis, including progressive massive fibrosis. We are delighted to support the Mine Safety and Health Administration's plans to strengthen the rules for respirable coal mine dust exposure, including a long overdue decrease in the allowable exposure limit and improved efforts to measure and control hazardous exposures. These improvements in coal mine dust regulations are essential to the prevention of coal workers' pneumoconiosis, silicosis and other health effects suffered by miners in our country."" Cecile Rose MD, director of the Miners Clinic of Colorado ""Based on the stories we hear during our visits, coal miners are afraid to speak out because their job, their livelihood could be in peril. Protections promised in previous years are not there for this working class. I can also confirm that the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health's recent data suggesting that there is a higher incidence of simple pneumoconiosis and more severe disease in younger miners is what we are witnessing in the Black Lung clinics... As always, we will continue to educate the miners that present to our facility that prevention is imperative, and as health care workers we would love the see the elimination of this devastating disease. You have the full support of our staff. Thank you for continuing to make it a priority to protect our patients and our family members in the coal industry."" Susie J. Criss, director, Black Lung Program, New River Breathing Center ""The experience in this clinical setting is that more miners are getting massive pulmonary fibrosis or complicated black lung. This increase in complicated black lung is a national trend reported by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health. Workers with this form of black lung continue to become more and more disabled even after they are removed from the dusty environments of their jobs. Anything we can do to prevent the continuation of this disease needs to be done now. I will support any and all measures that will eliminate black lung."" Deborah L. Wills, Black Lung Program, Valley Health Systems Inc. ""We continue to treat and assist miners every day, most with black lung disease and many disabled from this disease. Black lung disease is not a disease of the past but continues to affect our nation's miners in Pennsylvania and indeed throughout the country. I support these standards as a way to finally end this entirely preventable disease. NIOSH recommended reducing the PEL by half more than a decade ago, but this was never implemented. This is a grave disservice to this hardworking population without whom more than half of our country would be without electricity. Recent NIOSH studies show that the failure to establish more stringent respirable dust standards has taken a large toll on coal miners as they have identified a resurgence of the disease in the past decade with younger miners becoming ill with more severe disease.

Many 401(k)-type plans allow workers to make their own investment decisions. Current law does not require that all workers be given the information they need to make informed investment decisions or, when information is given, that it is furnished in a user-friendly format. This rule will ensure that all workers who direct their plan investments have access to the information they need to make informed decisions regarding the investment of their retirement savings, including fee and expense information. Under the rule, workers will receive this information in a format that enables them to meaningfully compare the investment options under their plans.

The dollar stores and their owners agreed to two partial consent judgments resolving the department's lawsuit over alleged violations of the federal Fair Labor Standards Act, including the failure to pay minimum wages and overtime compensation to employees who worked in excess of 40 hours a week. The Labor Department filed suit last year in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York naming the following defendants: U.S. Dream Inc. of Iselin, N.J.; Dollar Program LLC doing business as 99 Cent Dreams of New York City; Dollar Super Inc. doing business as 99 Cent Dream of Brooklyn; Dollar One Inc. doing business as Dollar One of Brooklyn; Dollar Pack Inc. doing business as Dollar Pack of Bronx; Dollar Motion Inc. doing business as Dollar Motion of Brooklyn; Pitkin Dollar Store Inc. doing business as Dollar Xpress of Brooklyn; Dollar Does It Inc. doing business as Dollar Does It of Bronx; Dollar Moon Inc. doing business as Dollar Moon of New York City; Dollar Budget Inc. doing business as 99 Cent Dreams of Queens Village; and Dollar Street Inc. doing business as 99 Cent Dream of Jamaica, N.Y. Also named as defendants were the various owners of these companies, including Muhammad M. Abbasi, Mohammad S. Andha, Mohammed Memon, Basit H. Motiwala and Muhammad Irfan. ""We took this legal action because, in the past, these defendants have professed to operate single establishments even though they are actually operating a large, multi-establishment retail enterprise with many locations,"" said Maria Rosado, director of the Wage and Hour Division's district office in New York City. ""The defendants have been failing to properly pay employees even after investigations of individual establishments put them on notice of the law's requirements."" An additional company, Dollar Ship Inc., operated by defendant Muhammad M. Abbasi, also was found in violation of the FLSA and is included in this settlement. The Labor Department is asking anyone who knows current and former employees who worked at the above-named stores between June 24, 2006, and May 31, 2010, to refer them to the Wage and Hour Division's Brooklyn office at 718-254-9410. These individuals may be due back wages as part of this settlement. The department filed the suit following an investigation by the Wage and Hour Division which found that employees working at the companies' retail stores often were paid at hourly rates less than the federal minimum wage, and were required to work more than 40 hours in many weeks without being properly compensated. The investigation also found that the companies failed to maintain adequate and accurate records of their employees, wages, hours and other conditions of employment. The FLSA requires that covered employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, as well as one and one-half times their regular hourly rates of pay for every hour they work beyond 40 per week. The law also requires employers to maintain accurate records of employees' wages, hours and other conditions of employment, and prohibits employers from retaliating against employees who exercise their rights under the law. The consent judgments, entered by the court, permanently prohibit the defendants from future violations of the FLSA's minimum wage, overtime pay, recordkeeping and anti-retaliation requirements. The judgments order the defendants to pay the total of $485,607 owed in back wages and damages in accordance with a payment schedule. If any of the defendants fail to make any of the payments on time, the court can appoint a receiver with the power to seize and liquidate their assets to satisfy the order. The defendants also are ordered to install timekeeping systems in their stores and train employees in their use, and to inform their employees of their rights under the law. The New York District Office of the Wage and Hour Division conducted this investigation, and the case was litigated by the department's New York City Regional Solicitor's Office.

The Accurate Paving Inc. Prime Builder 401(k) Plan was sponsored and administered by the company until it ceased all operations in 2003. The Labor Department’s suit alleges that Accurate Paving failed to take steps to ensure the continuing prudent administration of the plan. The “pertinent period” covered by the suit includes plan years 2003 until the present. The department’s suit alleges that John Trainor was president, treasurer and secretary of Accurate Paving, and served as administrator of the 401(k) plan, and that John Pappas was the plan trustee. After the company went out of business, these individuals stopped managing the plan and failed to take steps to terminate it and distribute its assets to covered former employees. As a result, plan participants have been unable to access their 401(k) accounts. Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, the federal law that protects private pension and employee benefit plans and which is administered by the Labor Department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration, plans must be managed by named fiduciaries. In the absence of a plan fiduciary, participants and beneficiaries cannot obtain plan information, make investments or collect retirement benefits. Despite diligent efforts, the Labor Department has been unable to contact either Trainor or Pappas. The plan had five participants and approximately $6,874 in assets as of April 13, 2009, the latest data available. The Labor Department’s suit asks the court to appoint an independent fiduciary to administer the plan, distribute its assets to eligible participants and beneficiaries, and oversee the plan’s termination. “Even in a small case like this, workers should know that they can turn to the Labor Department for assistance when they find themselves locked out of access to their retirement plan,” said Edward Maloney, acting regional director of EBSA’s Boston office. “We took this legal action to ensure that the plan is properly managed so that its participants can finally gain access to their retirement assets.” This suit resulted from an investigation conducted by EBSA’s Boston Regional Office. Employers and workers can contact that office at 617-565-9600 or toll-free at 866-444-3272 for help with any problems relating to private sector pension and health plans. In fiscal year 2009, EBSA achieved monetary results of $1.3 billion related to pension, 401(k), health and other benefits for millions of American workers and their families.

"October 8, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20101008,Statement of Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis on September employment numbers,"WASHINGTON – Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis issued the following statement on the September 2010 Employment Situation report released today: ""This past September, nonfarm payroll employment edged down 95,000 jobs, but the economy gained 64,000 jobs in the private sector, and the unemployment rate remained at 9.6 percent. ""In the six months before the president took office, we lost nearly 4 million jobs. We now have added private sector jobs for nine straight months, totaling 863,000 private sector jobs since the beginning of the year. While we need to pick up the pace of recovery to erase the job losses and get Americans back to work, this encouraging growth shows that we are headed in the right direction. ""To continue our commitment to American workers, this week, the president announced the Skills for America's Future initiative that will make it easier to connect students looking for jobs with businesses looking to hire. Our community colleges serve as a gateway to good jobs for millions of middle class Americans, and this initiative will dramatically improve private sector partnerships with community colleges to maximize workforce development strategies, increase job placement and ensure American competiveness. ""As the secretary of labor, I have traveled around the country to observe many of the innovative ways that community colleges are training American workers. At the Department of Labor, we work with community colleges across the country to provide apprenticeship training and job training skills. ""Working together through many of our One-Stop Career Centers, community colleges have been a strategic partner in providing the necessary training for our nation's workforce. And I'm proud to say that in the last 18 months, more than 1 million program participants – who were unemployed at participation – in our Workforce Investment Act Adult, Dislocated Worker, National Emergency Grant and Older Youth programs have obtained employment within three months of their program exit. ""While we are working to speed the pace of job creation and hiring, we continue to work for small businesses. This commitment is reflected in the Small Business Jobs bill the president signed last week – a bill that represents the most significant step on behalf of our small businesses in more than a decade. ""In addition, last week we learned that the Recovery Act has been so efficient in distributing its funds that 3,000 more projects have been funded than originally anticipated. Consequently, as the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has noted, the Recovery Act is on track to meet the administration's goal of preserving 3.5 million jobs by the end of the year. ""We are on the road to recovery. The president and I have confidence in the American economy, and we have confidence in the American people. We will continue fighting every day to keep this economy moving forward."""

"October 7, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20101007,MSHA issues 11 closure orders during surprise inspection at West Virginia coal mine,"ARLINGTON, Va. The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration today announced the issuance of 11 closure orders to Elk Run Coal Co.'s Seng Creek Powellton Mine when federal inspectors last week discovered that the mine was taking illegal cuts into the coal seam, operating without proper ventilation and not completing required air readings, which are needed to assure there is sufficient air flow to prevent mine explosions. The mine is owned by Massey Energy Co. and located in Boone County, W.Va. ""This week we mark the six-month anniversary of the devastating explosion at Upper Big Branch Mine,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""Rather than learn from this tragedy, there are mine operators that continue the 'catch me if you can' tactics, ignoring basic mining laws, and placing their workers at great risk of injury, illness and mine explosions. They know that MSHA cannot be at the mines all the time, and miners pay the ultimate price. ""While MSHA will use the full measure of the law to deal with those who persist in refusing to follow the safety and health regulations, the results of the Seng Creek inspection only reinforce the need for new legislation to halt these kinds of practices,"" Main added. Following up on reports that the mine operator had been taking deep cuts, an MSHA supervisor and two inspectors arrived at the mine on Tuesday, Sept. 28, in the middle of the evening shift. The supervisor immediately informed mine personnel not to notify miners underground of their arrival and that they could be cited if they refused to comply. Inspectors discovered the illegal extended cuts into the coal on the No. 1 section. Although deep cuts can greatly boost productivity, they also can increase float coal dust accumulations underground. Thus, such cuts must first be approved by MSHA. In addition, many areas of the working section were without adequate ventilation while these excessive cuts were being taken, exposing miners to the risk of explosions and black lung. The mine foreman, who is directly responsible for miners' health and safety and complying with regulatory requirements, admitted he had not been taking air readings during the work shift. Furthermore, he allowed fly pads (backup curtains), which control the ventilation, to be rolled up against the mine roof ,which short circuits the mine ventilation to allow easier access of mining equipment. In one particular area, suspended coal dust was so thick it was difficult to determine the proximity of the massive continuous mining machine. Since January 2009, the Seng Creek Powellton Mine has been issued 264 citations, orders and safeguards. The 11 orders and one citation issued last week ultimately were abated through additional training and installation of ventilation controls and roof supports. The citation was for the operator's failure to ensure miners wear safety glasses when there is a danger of flying particles."

Applicants will be assessed on the design of strategies that meet the criteria in the scope of work, which includes the following five goals for combating child labor: Reduce exploitative child labor through provision of direct educational services and address the root causes of child labor. Strengthen policies on child labor, education and sustainable livelihood, as well as the capacity of national institutions to combat child labor. Increase public awareness of exploitative and hazardous child labor, its root causes and the importance of education for all children. Support research, evaluation and reliable data collection on child labor, its root causes and effective strategies. Promote the long-term sustainability of efforts to address issues involving child labor. The solicitation requires applicants to propose strategies that focus on sectors and geographic areas with the highest prevalence of child exploitation. It further calls for securing linkages with government and social partners, and drawing on best practices to build cost-effective models for reducing child labor in rural and urban areas that can be scaled up and applied to vulnerable populations throughout the country. Applications must be submitted by 5 p.m. EST on Nov. 24, 2010, as a hard copy to the Labor Department or electronically at http://www.grants.gov .

"October 7, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ofccp/ofccp20101007,US Labor Department settles discrimination case with 2nd-largest Coca-Cola bottler in the nation,"CHARLOTTE , N.C. — Coca-Cola Bottling Company Consolidated has agreed to pay $495,000 in back wages and interest to 95 African-American and Hispanic job seekers who applied in 2002 for sales support positions at the company's Black Satchel Road distribution facility in Charlotte. The settlement follows an investigation by the U.S. Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs. In addition to back pay, the Coca-Cola bottler agreed to make offers of employment to those 95 applicants until at least 23 interested applicants are hired. Those hired will receive retroactive seniority benefits they would have accrued from July 1, 2002, if not for the discriminatory actions of the company. ""The Labor Department is firmly committed to ensuring that those who do business with our government do not discriminate in their employment practices,"" said OFCCP Director Patricia A. Shiu. ""Being a federal contractor is a privilege that comes with an obligation to ensure equal opportunity in employment."" This plant is the second largest Coca-Cola bottler in the nation and a major supplier of Coke brand products to military and government installations under a number of federal contracts. OFCCP's investigation of the company's hiring practices found that the Coca-Cola bottler failed to hire qualified minority applicants at a comparable rate to non-minority applicants. OFCCP's statistical analysis determined that the disparity in hires was too great to occur solely by chance. Additionally, OFCCP found that the bottler's own records revealed instances in which rejected minority applicants had more experience and education than some non-minority hires. OFCCP enforces Executive Order 11246, Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974. As amended, these three laws hold those who do business with the federal government, to the very reasonable standard that they not discriminate in their employment practices based on gender, race, color, religion, national origin, disability, or status as a protected veteran.

The grant awarded by the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of International Labor Affairs will be implemented by the International Labor Organization. ""Better Work is a highly successful strategy that was first developed in Cambodia 10 years ago. Its elements are worth replicating in other countries as a means of protecting workers' rights while promoting development,"" said Secretary Solis. ""Nicaragua joins those countries that embrace what is considered a gold standard for the respect of labor rights in the garment sector."" Better Work is a unique partnership program of the ILO and the International Finance Corp., which seeks to improve labor conditions in global supply chains, both to protect workers' rights and to help enterprises become more competitive. The Better Work program monitors conditions in export factories, publishes the results in a transparent manner, and assists suppliers to comply with labor standards that many buyers and customers demand. Better Work Nicaragua will focus on labor standards compliance in the country's garment factories. The program will engage the Nicaraguan Ministry of Labor, National Free Trade Commission, factory managers, employer organizations and trade unions, and provide guidance on challenges and solutions to labor compliance in ways that increase the viability of companies.

Under the order, entered in the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut, the court appointed Northeast Retirement Services Inc. of Woburn, Mass., to serve as the independent fiduciary of the Miller Agency Inc. 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan and Trust. The independent fiduciary has the authority to manage the plan, distribute its assets to the plan’s participants and beneficiaries, and terminate the plan. The 401(k) plan was sponsored by the company to provide retirement benefits to the plan participants, who were employees of Miller Agency Inc. The company ceased operations in May 2008. Beginning in 2006, James P. Miller was president and sole director of the company, and served as the trustee and administrator of the plan. Miller, who died Dec. 1, 2008, was the only authorized signatory of the plan. Prior to ceasing operations in May 2008, the company failed to take steps to ensure the ongoing prudent administration of the plan. As a result, former employees of the company have been unable to access their 401(k) accounts. Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, plans must be managed by fiduciaries. In the absence of a plan fiduciary, participants and beneficiaries cannot obtain plan information, make investments or collect retirement benefits. As of June 30, 2009, the plan had six participants and assets totaling $128,147. “It’s unfortunate when the closure of a company ultimately results in the workers who have lost their jobs also being unable to access the benefits they have earned,” said Edward Maloney, acting regional director of the Labor Department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration in Boston, Mass. “We took this legal action to ensure that the plan is properly managed so that its participants can finally gain access to their retirement assets.” The case was investigated by EBSA’s Boston Regional Office.

Stover allegedly used employee contributions owed to the company’s 401(k) plan to pay the operating expenses of the company in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act.

"October 1, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/odep/odep20101001,Statement by Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis on National Disability Employment Awareness Month 2010,"WASHINGTON — Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis today issued the following statement on the president's proclamation of October as National Disability Employment Awareness Month 2010. The theme for this year is ""Talent Has No Boundaries: Workforce Diversity Includes People with Disabilities."" ""Across America, there are 54 million people with disabilities, and their talents enrich our communities every single day. Yet opening the door to opportunity for many of these workers remains a challenge. President Obama and I believe this reality undermines the true strength of our economy and our nation, and we are taking decisive steps to address the situation. ""The president signed a landmark executive order on July 26, 2010, that calls on all federal agencies to set goals for increasing the numbers of people with disabilities who are hired. The order also looks to improve the retention and return-to-work rate of federal employees with disabilities. ""Furthermore, with the president's support, my department is soliciting input from the public on how we can strengthen the affirmative action requirements of the regulations implementing Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Proposed changes to this provision of the law would hold federal contractors, which create 25 percent of available jobs in America, to benchmarks for hiring qualified workers with disabilities. ""Meanwhile, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics and its Office of Disability Employment Policy have gathered data on the workforce participation and unemployment rates of people with disabilities. These numbers will give policymakers, business leaders, advocates — and every other American — a more accurate picture of the workforce situation facing job seekers with disabilities. ""We recognize that expanding work opportunities is just part of the solution. As for all other workers, training is often the key to securing a good job for those with disabilities. That is especially true for young people. Our support of the National Youth Technical Assistance Center helps state and local workforce development systems better serve youth with disabilities. And ODEP just released the department's first 'Return-to-Work Toolkit,' which is designed to help employees who have not been working due to significant illness, injury or disability return to work. ""People with disabilities are an integral part of our diverse workforce, and access to fair employment for everyone must remain a priority for our nation. To that end, the Labor Department will continue building a long-term infrastructure that helps bring together employers and job seekers, including those who have disabilities. That commitment will endure not just through National Disability Employment Awareness Month, but every single day."""

The district qualified for the funds available under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act by making state unemployment benefits available to part-time workers and by providing additional weeks of benefits to UI beneficiaries enrolled in approved training programs. ""The District of Columbia has made important updates to its UI program to better meet the needs of today s workforce, and that is why the district is receiving this grant today,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""Especially in challenging times like this, it is imperative that the safety net includes part-time workers and individuals who are upgrading their skills to obtain better jobs."" The District of Columbia Department of Employment Security may use the funds to pay unemployment benefits or, if appropriated by the Council of the District of Columbia, for administering its unemployment insurance program or delivering employment services. The Recovery Act made a total of $7 billion available in UI modernization incentive payments to states that include certain eligibility provisions in their UI programs. Each state can qualify for a share of those funds by showing that its law includes those provisions. The district s approved application will be posted on the Labor Department s Employment and Training Administration website at http://www.doleta.gov/recovery .

"September 30, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20100930,"MSHA announces tougher POV provisions, responds to OIG audit","ARLINGTON , Va. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration today announced the second phase in major reforms to its pattern of violations process, which includes tougher provisions for mines with chronic and persistent violations of significant health and safety regulations. This announcement coincides with the release of an independent analysis prepared by the Labor Department's Office of Inspector General: ""In 32 years MSHA Has Never Successfully Exercised its Pattern of Violation Authority."" Earlier this week, MSHA publicized new screening criteria for the POV enforcement program. ""We agree with the final recommendations in the OIG report and welcome that input, which we believe will help us improve the process already underway at MSHA,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""Our efforts are focused on ensuring that future potential POV and POV determinations are an effective part of MSHA's enforcement strategy and advance Congress's intent – that mine operators find and fix the root causes of violations before they become a hazard to miners."" As noted earlier this week, work on the current potential POV process is a stopgap measure to be used until other regulatory or legislative reforms occur. Mines that have received potential POV notification will have the opportunity to submit a corrective action program, which must contain: concrete, meaningful measures to reduce their significant and substantial, or S&S, violations; achievable benchmarks and milestones for implementing the program; management oversight to ensure the program is being instituted and followed; and measures to find and fix the mine's specific compliance problems. The new procedures include more meaningful corrective action programs and measures to help ensure long-term compliance on the part of mine operators. A mine placed on a potential POV must meet more stringent goals to avoid the sanctions of a POV. Mines that implement appropriate corrective action programs will need to achieve a 50 percent reduction in the rate of S&S violations or a rate within the top 50 percent for all mines of similar type and classification. Mines that do not choose to implement corrective action programs will need to achieve a 70 percent or more reduction in their S&S issuance rates or a rate within the top 35 percent for all mines of similar type and classification. If a mine fails to meet the requirements of a potential POV and is placed on a POV, each violation that is determined to be an S&S violation will be an automatic closure order. To avoid that enforcement action, the mine operator must have a complete inspection of the mine by MSHA without a single S&S violation being found. Any decision not to place a mine on POV status will be documented, and the mine will be closely monitored for backsliding. Mines that do meet reductions will also be monitored and subject to future potential POV screenings. A POV panel consisting of personnel from three separate divisions of MSHA will review any questions raised on mitigating factors regarding mines selected for potential POV action. This panel will help ensure consistency of application of both the quantitative and qualitative criteria."

The consortia will create replicable models and strategies that can be used nationwide by businesses and employers to reach out to people with disabilities in their communities, build a national and local network of experts skilled in serving a diversity of individuals with disabilities, and improve employment opportunities and outcomes for diverse people with disabilities. According to recent data from the department's Bureau of Labor Statistics , as of August 2010, the percentage of individuals with disabilities participating in the labor force was 22.0 percent compared with 70.2 percent for individuals with no disability. About one in five people with disabilities is in the labor force, and the unemployment rate for those with disabilities remains much higher than the national average. ""This administration is committed to expanding job opportunities for all Americans, including individuals with disabilities,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""Add Us In will expand opportunities for workers with disabilities and help ensure that everyone who wants to work can find a good job."" More than 10 million Americans who are members of ethnic and racial minority groups have long-lasting disabling conditions or impairments. When looking at the relationship between disability and employment, researchers have found that individuals with disabilities from these groups are often at increased risk for unemployment. Add Us In is an important step toward integrating disability and diversity into employers' workforce planning and addressing employment disparities for people with disabilities. Assistant Secretary of Labor for Disability Employment Policy Kathy Martinez noted, ""It is quite appropriate for the Add Us In grants to be awarded on the eve of National Disability Employment Awareness Month. We look forward to the Add Us In consortia improving the ability of businesses to employ individuals with disabilities and serving as examples of success during NDEAM for many years to come.""

If customers find benefits they may be interested in applying for, Benefits.gov offers the ability to add benefits from the results list to ""Your Favorites,"" a further customized list of benefit results. Both lists can be printed or e-mailed to enable users to review their results at a later time. Another enhanced feature of Benefits.gov is that the entire site is available in both English and Spanish. ""What was already a great site is now even better,"" said Edward Hugler, Department of Labor deputy assistant secretary for operations in the Office of Administration and Management. ""Benefits.gov's user-friendly design and search tools will make it easier than ever for citizens to find the government assistance information they're looking for.""

"September 29, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20100929,US Labor Department awards more than $21 million in Disability Employment Initiative cooperative agreements to 9 states,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor today announced an award of $21,276,575 to nine states under the Disability Employment Initiative to improve education, training, and employment opportunities and outcomes of youth and adults who are unemployed and/or receiving Social Security disability benefits. The Disability Employment Initiative is jointly funded and administered by the department's Employment and Training Administration and its Office of Disability Employment Policy. ""During these difficult economic times, we want to make it possible for all workers, especially those with disabilities, to benefit from the Labor Department's employment and retraining services that have a proven success rate,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""Through this new grant, individuals with disabilities will be able to utilize the necessary tools to obtain permanent and secure jobs."" The Labor Department has entered into cooperative agreements with the following states to implement strategic approaches to support exemplary employment services for individuals with disabilities in the public workforce system: Alaska, Arkansas, Delaware, Illinois, Kansas, Maine, New Jersey, New York and Virginia. These projects build upon the department's Disability Program Navigator Initiative by hiring staff with expertise in disability and workforce issues. The grants also will support extensive partnerships, collaboration and services provided across multiple workforce and disability systems in each state. These involve state vocational rehabilitation services, mental health and developmental disability agencies, Medicaid Infrastructure Grant-supported activities, independent living centers, business leadership networks, and other community and nonprofit provider organizations. Another critical component of the Disability Employment Initiative is expanding the workforce system's involvement with the Social Security Administration's Ticket to Work program. The Disability Employment Initiative requires a state workforce agency or local workforce investment boards participating in a cooperative agreement to become employment networks under the Ticket to Work Program. The department recognizes that many Supplemental Security Income and Social Security Disability Insurance beneficiaries utilize the mainstream workforce system to seek employment opportunities, as shown in the May 2010 Mathematica Policy Research Inc. report ""Use of One-Stops by Social Security Disability Beneficiaries in Four States Implementing Disability Program Navigator Initiatives,"" which is available at http://www.doleta.gov/disability/whatsnew.cfm . The department considers individuals with the most significant disabilities to be a major priority, with grant resources focused on their entry or return to work.

""The UMWACC and MSHA have continued a close working relationship through various contracts and cooperative agreements established in September 2008 and 2009,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""The partnership has developed successful training programs and competitions for mine rescue teams and first responders."" ""The Sago, Aracoma and Darby mine disasters of 2006 indicated the need to better train and prepare mine rescue teams to effectively respond to mine emergencies at underground coal mines,"" added Gregory R. Wagner M.D., MSHA's deputy assistant secretary for policy. ""One of the best methods for preparing miners to respond to an emergency is through simulated mine emergency training."" The Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006, signed in the wake of these high-profile disasters, called for enhancing mine rescue teams and the development of up-to-date accident response plans Under the cooperative agreement, training may be conducted in classrooms, mine simulation lab facilities or, where possible, at mine sites with mine personnel. While distance learning is not excluded from the options, the focus of the program will be on training in real and simulated mine conditions. Training likely will be conducted at the following locations: The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health's Pittsburgh Research Laboratory in Bruceton, Pa.; the National Mine Health and Safety Academy Mine Simulation Laboratory in Beaver, W.Va.; and the Mining Technology and Training Center in Ruff Creek, Pa."
"September 29, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20100929,US Labor Departments OSHA reports on state-run occupational safety and health programs,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration today announced that it has concluded a special evaluation of state-run occupational safety and health programs under its jurisdiction. Enhanced Federal Annual Monitoring and Evaluation reports provide detailed findings and recommendations on the operations of state-run OSHA programs in 25 states and territories. The enhanced review was initiated after a 2009 special OSHA report on Nevada's program, prompted by numerous construction-related fatalities in Las Vegas, identified serious operational deficiencies in that state. ""Our goal is to identify problems in state-run programs before they result in serious injuries or fatalities,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for OSHA Dr. David Michaels. ""While we found many positives in the state programs, we also found deficiencies including concerns about identification of hazards, proper classification of violations, proposed penalty levels, and failure to follow up on violations to ensure that workplace safety and health problems are corrected."" The EFAME report and appendices for each of the 25 states, as well as each state's comment and fiscal year 2009 self-evaluation report, are now available on OSHA's website at http://www.osha.gov/dcsp/osp/efame/ . States will have 30 days to provide a formal response, including a detailed corrective action plan for addressing findings and recommendations. Each state's formal response will be public information and available online as soon as it is received. The EFAME review also identified areas where states have adopted standards and procedures exceeding federal OSHA's requirements, such as injury and illness prevention programs in California, Washington, Oregon, Minnesota and other states; the adoption of a cranes and derricks rule prior to OSHA's in North Carolina, Washington and Maryland; and Oregon's requirement that employers abate serious workplace violations during the contest period, a legal tool under consideration in Congress but still lacking in federal OSHA. The review of the Hawaii program highlights significant performance problems resulting from staffing and funding cutbacks. OSHA is addressing these problems directly with the governor's office and has offered to provide supplemental federal enforcement assistance until the state can address its problems. If Hawaii is unable to present a reasonable strategy for expeditiously improving its worker safety and health oversight, consideration will be given to the state's current authority to operate its own program independently and could result in a federal takeover. ""We recognize that some of the problems we identified could stem from significant budget constraints in many of the states and may also be the result of less intensive federal oversight in recent years,"" Michaels added. ""OSHA, through its regional offices, intends to provide assistance in the implementation of corrective actions and will work closely with state officials to review progress. We are confident that by working together to address identified problems, we can improve state operations and provide more consistent protection to all of America's workers."" The 25 states and territories evaluated are Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, U.S. Virgin Islands, Virginia, Washington and Wyoming. No reports are being issued on the Nevada and Illinois state plans; a special study was issued on the Nevada state plan in October 2009, and the Illinois state plan was not approved until September 2009. The status of each state's efforts to improve its plans will be reflected in the fiscal year 2010 Federal Annual Monitoring and Evaluation report expected in 2011. For more information about those states operating their own plans, visit http://www.osha.gov/dcsp/osp/ . When Congress enacted the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, it created an opportunity for federal-state partnerships to promote safety and health. Section 18 of the law allows states to develop and enforce occupational safety and health standards in the context of an OSHA-approved state plan. Twenty-seven states and territories have sought and obtained approval. Twenty-one states and Puerto Rico have complete programs covering both the private sector and state and local governments. Four states and the U.S. Virgin Islands have programs limited in coverage to public sector employees. Currently, state plans deliver the OSHA program to 40 percent of the nation's workplaces, with federal OSHA responsible for the other 60 percent. State plan standards and enforcement must be at least as effective as federal OSHA in providing safe and healthful employment to workers. In addition, state plans operate under authority of state law, not delegated federal authority. Thus, in order to operate its own plan, a state must enact an equivalent of the federal OSH Act and must use administrative and regulatory procedures to adopt its own standards, regulations and operating procedures, all of which must be updated within six months of any change in the federal program. Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. OSHA's role is to assure these conditions for America's working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education and assistance.

Continued funding in the amount of $1.6 million was awarded by exercising the first option year of a cooperative agreement between ODEP and Cornell University that provides for the center's operation. The center is also referred to as the National Employer Technical Assistance Center. ""Employers need talented, highly skilled workers to compete in today's global economy,"" said Kathleen Martinez, assistant secretary of labor for ODEP. ""This technical assistance center provides the tools and resources employers need to find workers with disabilities and promote their full inclusion in the workplace."" This funding will continue the center's efforts to develop policy options and provide technical assistance to employers and employer organizations for the recruitment, hiring, retention and advancement of people with disabilities. In September 2009, the Labor Department competitively awarded Cornell University a 12-month cooperative agreement for an initial $1.6 million with four option years to manage a consortium charged with conducting research, assisting the Labor Department in developing and promoting employer-focused policy, disseminating information, and providing technical assistance to employers and employer organizations. The consortium also includes the AFL-CIO Center for Green Jobs, the Altarum Institute, the Conference Board, the Institute of Educational Leadership, the National Business and Disability Council, Rutgers University's John J.

The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, alleges that Timothy Hardt and Mark Dell Donne failed to collect employer and employee contributions owed to the plan between 2004 and 2008. The money was co-mingled with that of the company and used for purposes unrelated to the plan. Dell Donne is the president and chief executive officer of the company and Hardt is a former officer. At the time of the violations, the defendants were trustees of the plan, which covered approximately 264 employees. “The flagrant misuse of pension assets to subsidize corporate activities jeopardizes the retirement income of workers and will not be tolerated,” said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. “We took legal action to protect the retirement security of these workers and ensure that they receive the benefits they are due.” Journey Electrical Technologies Inc. is an electrical contracting company that performed work on municipal and state public works projects. The 401(k) plan was funded, in part, with fringe-benefit contributions from the company that are required to be made under prevailing wage laws. The plan also received contributions from employees through payroll deductions. The suit asks the court to require that Hardt and Dell Donne restore contributions and lost opportunity costs owed to the plan, and also to remove Dell Donne as a fiduciary to this plan as well as bar both Hardt and Dell Donne from serving as fiduciaries or service providers to any plan governed by ERISA. In addition, the suit asks the court to appoint an independent fiduciary to manage and administer the plan. In fiscal year 2009, the Labor Department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration achieved monetary results of $1.3 billion related to the pension, 401(k), health and other benefits for millions of American workers and their families. Employers and workers can reach EBSA’s Los Angeles Regional Office at 626-229-1000 or toll-free at 866-444-3272 for help with problems relating to private sector retirement and health plans. Employers with similar problems who are not the subject of investigations by EBSA may be eligible to participate in the department’s Voluntary Fiduciary Correction Program. Participation in the program requires employers to correct any violations but allows them to avoid EBSA enforcement actions and civil penalties as well as any applicable excise taxes.

"September 27, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20100927,MSHA takes steps to overhaul broken pattern of violations program,"ARLINGTON , Va. – The Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration has announced new screening criteria for the pattern of violations enforcement program, which gives the agency additional enforcement tools to use at mines with a history of violating safety standards. This is a critical first step in reforming the current pattern of violations enforcement program. The agency announced plans to draft new regulations governing the program in the spring, and the new criteria follow calls by Congress and the Department of Labor's Office of Inspector General to fix serious flaws in the current system. MSHA will implement new screening criteria and a new review process for determining whether a mine has exhibited a potential pattern of violations for its 2010 review of mine safety records. ""Since the passage of the Mine Act more than 30 years ago, not one mining operation has ever been placed on a pattern of violations,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""We have known for some time that the current system is broken and needs to be fixed. This new screening process improves upon the old one, which cast too broad a net and did not distinguish mines with the highest levels of elevated enforcement. This new system will let MSHA focus its attention on those mines that are putting miners at greatest risk."" ""MSHA's changes to the POV program cannot fix shortcomings that require legislation or changes to the existing regulations,"" Main added. ""This is a stop-gap measure until reform can occur. We are aggressively pursuing both regulatory and legislative reforms, but in the mean time this new policy improves our ability to identify problem mines. Our goal with each of these reform efforts is to identify mines with a pattern of dangerous conditions and encourage them to improve their safety records. If a mine fails to do so, it will be placed into POV status."" Section 104(e) of the federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (Mine Act) provides that mine operators with a pattern of significant and substantial violations be subject to closure orders for areas of the mine affected by those violations until the mine receives a clean inspection. Under current regulations, MSHA uses a screening process to determine whether a mine has a potential pattern of violations. A mine operator found to have a potential pattern of violations is given a period of time to reduce violations before MSHA uses its authority under 104(e) to issue closure orders. According to the legislative history of the Mine Act, POV provisions are intended for use ""at mines with a record of repeated [significant and substantial] violations and where the other enforcement provisions of the statute have not been effective in bringing the mine into compliance with federal health and safety standards."" The preamble to the existing final rule states that ""MSHA expects to reserve the use of the 104(e) sanctions for mines where the operator has not responded to an escalating series of enforcement actions by the Agency."" ""MSHA's changes to the screening process are designed to meet these statutory and regulatory objectives,"" said Main. ""The new screening criteria will draw more attention to the so-called 'bad actors' than did the old criteria. They will focus on mines that exhibit chronic failures to maintain safe working conditions, have repeated significant and substantial violations, and have not responded to other enforcement tools."" The new screening process is designed to identify mines that have been subject to closure orders, including closure orders for serious issues such as failing to correct violations after MSHA cites them, unwarrantable failures to comply with health or safety standards, failure to provide miners with required training and imminent dangers in the mine. The criteria will better identify mines where these tools have been used but have not been sufficient to improve compliance. The criteria also will consider whether a mine has high numbers of significant and substantial or S&S, violations involving elevated negligence, as well as a mine's injury severity rate, targeting operations with an above-average injury severity measure. All of these factors are either new to the screening criteria or given greater emphasis than before. The quantitative criteria use the most recent available 12 months of health and safety data to screen for mines. The screening criteria address two categories of violators. In the first category, a mine must exhibit high numbers of S&S violations (at least 50); have S&S violations either issued at an elevated rate (eight per 100 inspection hours) or at elevated levels (25 percent or more) of negligence; have a high rate of elevated enforcement actions (.5 per 100 inspection hours) (In almost all cases these must be closure orders for serious problems.); and have an elevated record of severe injuries (above the industry rate). The second category targets mines that do not meet the above criteria but still have high numbers of S&S violations and elevated enforcement actions – at least 100 S&S citations/orders and at least 40 elevated citations/orders. In addition, as required under current regulations, the screening requires mines in both categories to have either repeated S&S violations of the same standard (at least five) or repeated S&S violations caused by an unwarrantable failure to comply with the law (at least two). Editor's Note : The ""Pattern of Violations Screening Criteria 2010"" follow. Pattern of Violations Screening Criteria - 2010 A computer-generated report is run that retrieves data for the most recent 12 months in which data are available for every mine under MSHA's jurisdiction. All non-abandoned mines (on the date the report is generated) are reviewed to determine if a potential pattern of violations may exist. Initial Screening Criteria (30 CFR 104.2) The following two sets of screening criteria are used to perform the initial screening required under 30 CFR 104.2. Mines must meet the criteria in either set to be further considered for exhibiting a potential pattern of violations. Mines meeting all of the following four criteria are further screened to identify those that meet appropriate criteria, as specified in 30 CFR 104.3, for a potential pattern of violations. At least 50 citations/orders for significant and substantial (S&S) violations issued in the most recent 12 months. A rate of eight or more S&S citations/orders issued per 100 inspection hours during the most recent 12 months OR the degree of negligence for at least 25 percent of the S&S citations/orders issued during the most recent 12 months is ""high"" or ""reckless disregard."" At least 0.5 elevated citations and orders [issued under section 104(b); 104(d); 104(g); or 107(a) of the Mine Act] issued per 100 inspection hours during the most recent 12 months. An Injury Severity Measure1 (SM) for the mine that is greater than the overall Industry SM for all mines in the same mine type and classification over the most recent 12 months.2 Or Mines meeting both of the following two criteria are further screened to identify those that meet appropriate criteria, as specified in 30 CFR 104.3, for a potential pattern of violations. At least 100 S&S citations/orders issued in the most recent 12 months. At least 40 elevated citations and orders [issued under section 104(b); 104(d); 104(g); or 107(a) of the Mine Act] issued during the most recent 12 months. Pattern Criteria Screening (30 CFR 104.3) 30 CFR 104.3 requires that one of the following pattern criteria be met: (1) a history of repeated S&S violations of a particular standard; (2) a history of repeated S&S violations of standards related to the same hazard; or (3) a history of repeated S&S violations caused by unwarrantable failure to comply. Only citations and orders that are final may be considered in determining if these criteria have been met. For a pattern of violations review, mines identified during the initial screening must have at least five S&S citations of the same standard that became final orders of the commission during the most recent 12 months OR at least two S&S unwarrantable failure violations that became final orders of the commission during the most recent 12 months. Footnotes 1Severity measure is the number of lost workdays per 200,000 employee-hours. The severity measure formula is SM = (Number of lost workdays x 200,000) Number of employee-hours. 2 There are six mine types and classifications: underground coal mines; surface coal mines; surface coal facilities; underground metal and nonmetal mines; surface metal and nonmetal mines; and surface metal and nonmetal facilities."

Solis on the 45th anniversary of the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs,"WASHINGTON — Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis issued the following statement in commemoration of the 45th anniversary of the signing of Executive Order 11246, creating what eventually became the U.S. Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs: ""Six months after brave men and women crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, and just six weeks after Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, the march to redeem America's promise took another important step forward. Asserting that civil rights laws alone were not enough to remedy discrimination, President Lyndon B. Johnson issued Executive Order 11246 on Sept. 24, 1965. ""This landmark order, which created the U.S. Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, requires those who do business with the U.S. government — both contractors and subcontractors — to ensure equal opportunity for all job seekers and wage earners. ""OFCCP's legal authority has since been expanded by the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974. As amended, these three laws hold federal contractors to the very reasonable standard that they must not discriminate in their employment practices on the basis of gender, race, color, religion, national origin, disability or status as a protected veteran. ""Nearly one in four American workers is employed by a company that receives taxpayer dollars for contracted work. That's more than 200,000 companies with contracts totaling over $700 billion. And it is the duty of OFCCP to see that those tax dollars are not used to discriminate. That helps ensure a fundamental fairness and levels the playing field for America's workers. ""So, today, I congratulate the nearly 800 OFCCP staff in offices across the nation as they mark 45 years of protecting workers, promoting diversity and enforcing the law. Their work ensures good jobs are within the grasp of everyone, and it makes America a more just — and better — place to work and live."""

Solis today issued the following statement on National Employ Older Workers Week, which takes place September 19 - 26. ""This week we celebrate the continued contributions of America's older workers. It is also a time to get word to every employer about the importance and benefits of hiring these seasoned professionals. After all, experience – coupled with a solid work ethic and strong decision making skills – makes for excellent job candidates. ""As for all other workers, the Labor Department is committed to the success of these vital members of America's workforce. To help in that nationwide effort, we have more than 3,000 One Stop Career Centers – a full list of which is available at www.servicelocator.org . The centers offer such services as resume writing assistance, career counseling and even direct job placement – all free of charge. In the current economic climate, leveraging these tools can help make the difference between getting a good, new job and facing long-term unemployment. ""The department also recently launched a new online tool that helps older workers match their existing skills to new job opportunities. The web portal is called ""mySkills myFuture"" and is accessed by going to www.myskillsmyfuture.org . Visitors can easily find out what jobs they are qualified for, search local job listings or locate training opportunities to help them upgrade their skills. ""We also administer the Senior Community Service Employment Program. By connecting older workers who have limited financial resources with paid community service jobs, SCSEP makes on-the-job skills training possible. The program is celebrating its 45th anniversary this year and, since its inception, it has helped more than one million older Americans enter the workforce. More information on SCSEP and a host of other programs designed to help America's older workers is available at www.doleta.gov/seniors/ . ""History shows that DOL's high quality resources and services help connect older workers with good jobs. That, in turn, helps families, businesses and entire communities thrive. But this only happens if employers get on board and actively seek and hire these hard-working and dynamic professionals. Those employers who do, comply with our laws, which say all job candidates must get equal consideration – regardless of age. They are also the businesses, which recognize that talent and commitment know no age and which leverage the tremendous resource that are our nation's older workers to lead the way in both innovation and market excellence. ""It's very simple. Workers age 55 and older are the fastest-growing segment of the American workforce. In fact, by 2014 they will make up almost 22 percent of the U.S. labor force. So, as our population ages, older Americans will play an increasingly important role in local, national and international economies. They will shape America's products and services, and help ensure our continued leadership in the international marketplace. Let's keep those facts in mind today and every day. Let's take a moment to thank the nation's older workers for their continued contributions to the country, and do everything possible so that they have the tools and opportunities they need and deserve. It's the right thing to do for older workers, and the right thing to do for the nation as a whole."""

"September 23, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20100923,"US Labor Department obtains court-appointed independent fiduciary  for 401(k) plan abandoned by Rowley, Mass., employer","BOSTON – The U.S. Department of Labor has obtained a court order appointing an independent fiduciary to manage the abandoned 401(k) plan of defunct VIPswitch Inc. of Rowley, Mass. Under the order, entered in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, the court appointed Northeast Retirement Services Inc. of Woburn, Mass., to serve as the independent fiduciary of the VIPswitch Inc. 401(k) plan. The independent fiduciary has the authority to manage the plan, distribute its assets to eligible participants and beneficiaries, and terminate the plan. The order resolves a lawsuit filed by the Labor Department in May of this year. The company, which ceased operations in January 2005, sponsored the 401(k) plan to provide retirement benefits to participants who were employees of VIPswitch. During the period beginning in 2001, Daniel Lefebvre was CFO of the company and was the plan administrator, while Luc Beaubien, the company’s former president, was the plan trustee and the only authorized signatory to the plan. Both individuals subsequently abandoned their fiduciary responsibilities to the plan and the Labor Department has been unable to contact them. When the company ceased operations, no steps were taken to ensure the continued prudent administration of the plan. As a result, former employees of the company have been unable to access their 401(k) accounts. Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, plans must be managed by fiduciaries. In the absence of a plan fiduciary, participants and beneficiaries cannot obtain plan information, make investments or collect retirement benefits. “When an employee benefit plan is abandoned, so are the workers who invested in it,” said Edward Maloney, acting regional director of the Labor Department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration in Boston. “We took this legal action to ensure that the plan is properly managed so that its participants can finally gain access to their retirement assets.” The case was investigated by EBSA’s Boston Regional Office. Employers and workers can contact that office at 617-565-9600 or may call EBSA’s toll-free number, 866-444-3272, for help with any problems relating to private sector pension and health plans. In fiscal year 2009, EBSA achieved monetary results of $1.3 billion related to pension, 401(k), health and other benefits for millions of American workers and their families.

"September 22, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20100922,US Department of Labors OSHA awards $2.75 million in Susan Harwood Targeted Topic Training Grants for safety and health training,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration today awarded $2.75 million in Susan Harwood Targeted Topic Training Grants to 16 organizations, including nonprofit and community/faith-based groups, employer associations, labor unions, joint labor/management associations, and colleges and universities. These grants will assist organizations in providing safety and health training, and educational programs for workers and employers. The $2.75 million is in addition to the $8 million OSHA awarded Sept. 9 to 45 organizations for the Susan Harwood Capacity Building Grants. Targeted Topic Training Grants are one-year grants that support the development of quality occupational safety and health training materials and programs for workers and employers addressing workplace hazards and prevention strategies. Earlier this month, OSHA announced the multi-year Susan Harwood Capacity Building Grants that build capacity in organizations to provide training and related services to workers and employers. ""This grant program is a crucial component to our efforts to provide workers with training about job hazards and their rights. It also provides employers with information about unsafe working conditions and their responsibilities under the law,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""The education and training organizations receiving grants are designed to prevent work-related injuries, illnesses and deaths by providing the knowledge and tools that workers and employers need to identify and correct workplace safety and health hazards,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for OSHA Dr. David Michaels. The Susan Harwood Targeted Topic Training Grant Program was named in honor of the late Susan Harwood, a former director of the Office of Risk Assessment in OSHA's health standards directorate, who died in 1996. The targeted topic grants support workplace occupational safety and health programs in both construction and general industry that educate workers and employers in industries with high hazard and fatality rates, workers with limited English proficiency, hard-to-reach workers and supervisors, and small business employers. Additionally, the grant provides funds to develop training materials to train workers and employers to recognize, avoid, abate and prevent safety and health hazards in their workplaces. The agency received a total of 168 targeted topic grant applications. This grant program is an important component of OSHA's efforts to provide workers in high-risk industries with training about job hazards and their rights. It also provides employers with crucial information about unsafe working conditions, mitigation strategies and their responsibilities under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970.

"September 22, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20100922,Mine Commission rules in favor of MSHA in Massey Energy case,"ARLINGTON , Va. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration announced that an Administrative Law Judge with the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission has ruled in favor of MSHA in a legal challenge filed last June by Massey Energy's Performance Coal Co. The company had challenged MSHA's protocol guidelines in the underground accident investigation of the Upper Big Branch Mine, in which the agency prohibited Massey Energy investigators from using cameras, collecting evidence, mapping and conducting sampling. In her ruling, ALJ Margaret A. Miller held that MSHA did not abuse its discretion in adopting the protocols and that the protocols ""are rationally connected to safely conducting the accident investigation."" MSHA, along with West Virginia's Office of Miners' Health Safety and Training, had outlined specific protocols in June to ensure the preservation of evidence. The agency considered input from all entities with an interest in the investigation, including Performance Coal. Furthermore, MSHA modified those protocols to accommodate a number of the company's requests. ""Naturally, we are pleased with Judge Miller's ruling in this case,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""The joint protocols were established with one goal in mind: to maintain the safety of all persons involved in the underground investigation and their exposure to potentially hazardous conditions. Having too many people underground would delay the investigation and increase the amount of time it takes for those persons to exit the mine in the event of an emergency. ""Massey's complaints about the investigation were unfounded, and the company was not disadvantaged in any way – they were allowed to request that certain photos be taken, to view them underground and promptly receive copies of them, to receive copies of maps, and to receive excess material from dust samples whenever possible,"" Main added. The ALJ's decision summarizes UBB lead investigator Norman Page's rationale for establishing the protocol guidelines. Page determined that a limited number of cameras should be underground, taking into consideration the fact that cameras are not permissible, that gas checks must be made before they are used, and that the inspection will proceed more quickly with only one photographer. In addressing the issue of mapping, Page again considered the issue of permissibility and the number of persons underground for purposes of safety. The same was true for dust sampling. After reviewing Page's actions, Judge Miller concluded that the secretary of labor, ""may insist on protocols that she believes are necessary to ensure the safety of the investigation. While those protocols may not be what Performance wants or expects, they are nonetheless reasonable and intended to ensure the safety of all persons in the mine."""
"September 21, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20100921,Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis announces partnership with US Department of Transportation to combat distracted driving by workers,"WASHINGTON – Because motor vehicle crashes are a leading cause of worker fatalities, Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis today announced a partnership between the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the U.S. Department of Transportation to combat distracted driving. ""It is imperative that employers eliminate financial and other incentives that encourage workers to text while driving,"" said Secretary Solis. ""It is well recognized that texting while driving dramatically increases the risk of a motor vehicle injury or fatality."" Prohibiting texting while driving is the subject of an executive order signed by President Barack Obama last year for federal employees and the subject of rulemaking by the Department of Transportation. OSHA is launching a multi-pronged initiative that includes: An education campaign for employers, to be launched during ""Drive Safely Work Week"" in early October, will call on employers to prevent occupationally related distracted driving, with a special focus on prohibiting texting while driving. An open letter to employers to be posted on OSHA's website, http://www.osha.gov during ""Drive Safely Work Week."" The website also will showcase model employer policies and encourage employer and labor associations to communicate OSHA's message. Alliances with the National Safety Council and other key organizations as outreach to employers, especially small employers, aimed at combating distracted driving and prohibit texting while driving. Special emphasis on reaching younger workers by coordinating with other Labor Department agencies as well as alliance partners and stakeholders. Investigate and issue citations and penalties where necessary to end the practice when OSHA receives a credible complaint that an employer requires texting while driving. ""We call upon all employers to prohibit any work policy or practice that requires or encourages workers to text while driving,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for OSHA Dr. David Michaels. ""The Occupational Safety and Health Act is clear; employers must provide a workplace free of recognized hazards."" Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. OSHA's role is to assure these conditions for America's working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education and assistance.

"September 21, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20100921,MSHA to publish emergency temporary standard for rock dust,"ARLINGTON , Va. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration today announced that on Sept. 23 the Federal Register is expected to publish an emergency temporary standard that revises the existing federal standard on maintenance of incombustible content of rock dust. The determination to create an ETS was based on MSHA's review of accident investigation reports of mine explosions in intake air courses that involved coal dust, as well as the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health's report ""Recommendations for a New Rock Dusting Standard to Prevent Coal Dust Explosions in Intake Airways,"" which can be viewed at http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/mining/pubs/pubreference/outputid2825.htm . ""Coal dust can cause explosions, and explosions kill miners. Inadequate rock dusting can dramatically increase the potential for a coal mine explosion,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""Compliance with the new standard will strengthen the protection for miners by minimizing the potential for such an explosion and, ultimately, will save lives."" The ETS, effective immediately, applies only to underground bituminous coal mines and can be viewed on Sept. 23 in the ""special filings"" section of the Federal Register 's website at http://www.ofr.gov . Emergency Temporary Standards take effect immediately when evidence is presented that workers are in grave danger. They remain in effect until a standard is promulgated through the regular rulemaking process. In addition to the ETS, MSHA is also issuing a program information bulletin, which provides guidance on compliance with the new standard. The bulletin may be viewed on MSHA's website at http://www.msha.gov . ""Explosions caused by coal dust are particularly violent and deadly,"" noted Mine Safety and Health Administration Assistant Secretary Joe Main. ""When the NIOSH report was released in May 2010 containing new scientific evidence that called for a higher standard, MSHA moved quickly to get this new standard in place. We also revised our guidance on rock dusting to ensure that mine operators are taking the steps necessary to provide for the safety of everyone working in their mines."" The existing MSHA standard requires mine operators to maintain at least 80 percent total incombustible content of combined dusts in return air courses and at least 65 percent TIC in all other areas. It also requires that the percent TIC of combined dust in all areas where methane is present in any ventilating current be increased. The 80 percent TIC must be increased by 0.4 percent for each 0.1 percent of methane in return air courses, and the 65 percent TIC must be increased by one percent for each 0.1 percent of methane present in all other areas. The ETS revises the existing standard by requiring mine operators to increase the total incombustible content of the combined coal dust, rock dust and other dust from 65 to 80 percent in all accessible areas of underground bituminous mines, and an additional 0.4 percent for each 0.1 percent of methane where methane is present in any ventilating current. Although the ETS is effective on Sept. 23, mine operators will have additional time for compliance in order to purchase more rock dust-related materials and equipment. Mine operators must comply with the ETS for newly mined areas by Oct. 7, 2010, and all other areas of the mine by Nov. 22, 2010. To meet these compliance dates, MSHA encourages mine operators to immediately begin rock dusting all other areas, starting with those that pose the greatest risk to miners: for example, areas near the active faces and areas that contain possible ignition sources, such as conveyer belt drives and belt entries. ""We know that it will take mine operators a little bit of time to bring their mines into compliance with the new standard,"" Main added. ""But coal dust explosions are serious, and we expect mine operators to act quickly to reduce the threat to those mining coal underground.""

"September 20, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20100920,MSHA announces results of 5 months of impact inspections,"ARLINGTON , Va. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration today announced that, from April through August, the agency conducted ""impact inspections"" at 111 coal and metal/nonmetal mines throughout the country designated by the agency as having safety or health issues. During that time, enforcement personnel issued 2,660 violations, 45 percent of which were classified as significant and substantial. These targeted inspections are part of an aggressive enforcement strategy launched in the wake of the worst mining disaster in almost 40 years. ""We have learned a lot of hard lessons since the explosion at Upper Big Branch Mine more than five months ago,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""While a number of mine operators receiving impact inspections have taken positive steps to clean up their act, some have refused to take seriously their responsibility to protect their workers and change their ways. We can't be at every mine every day, but when we have reason to believe that a particular mine operator is putting miners' lives at risk, we will not sit back and wait for a disaster to happen."" Throughout the course of the impact inspections, MSHA enforcement personnel employed a number of tactics at some mines to catch operators off guard, including late afternoon or evening arrivals at the mine site, driving unmarked government vehicles, and seizing mine phones to thwart communication between mining personnel working on the surface and those working underground. ""We are striving to make our inspections more strategic, less predictable and more effective,"" said Main. Inspectors issued nearly 200 withdrawal orders at mines resulting from unwarrantable failures to comply with the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, as well as eight Section 107(a) withdrawal orders due to imminent dangers. Some mine operations actually fared worse during follow-up inspections. For example, CAM Mining LLC's Mine No. 28 in Pike County, Ky., received 42 citations and orders, with a ""significant and substantial"" rate of nearly 31 percent during its April inspection. In a July inspection, the operator received 73 citations and orders, with an S&S rate of nearly 44 percent. Wilcoal Mining's Tri-State One Mine in Claiborne County, Tenn., received 33 citations and orders, with an S&S rate of nearly 65 percent in April. In its July inspection, the operator was cited for 38 citations and orders, with an S&S rate of nearly 65 percent. As a result of 11 orders issued by MSHA, the mine was shut down. MSHA initiated the new impact inspection program as the agency continues to work to reform the broken ""pattern of violations"" program, which was intended to identify persistent violators of safety standards and subject those mines to an enhanced enforcement regime. MSHA formally announced its intention to rewrite the regulations that govern the program last spring after it became clear that the program is not meeting its intended purpose. The current impact inspections are designed, in part, to catch problems that would otherwise be addressed by a functioning pattern of violations system. Mine operations were selected for impact inspections based on specific criteria: poor compliance history, including high numbers of violations or closure orders; indications of operator tactics, such as advance notification of inspections that prevent inspectors from observing violations; frequent hazardous complaints or hotline calls; inadequate workplace examinations; a high number of accidents, injuries or illnesses; fatalities; and adverse conditions such as increased methane liberation, faulty roof conditions and inadequate ventilation. ""Clearly, there are still too many mine operators who have not learned the lessons of Upper Big Branch and continue to put miners' lives at risk,"" said Main. ""They don't yet understand the value of safety in our nation's mines. That's got to change. Our mission is to protect miners, and protect them we must.""

"September 16, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20100916,National Direct Support Professionals Recognition Week Statement by Labor Secretary Solis and HHS Secretary Sebelius on S. Res. 558 Designation,"WASHINGTON Direct support professionals – nurse aides, home health aides, and personal and home care aides – are the primary providers of paid hands-on care for millions of individuals with disabilities. They assist individuals with a broad range of personal assistance including preparation of meals, helping with medications, bathing, dressing, mobility; and getting to planned activities, on a daily basis. The U.S. Departments of Health and Human Services and Labor are proud that the United States Senate has bestowed this recognition honoring direct support professionals and the tremendous impact they make everyday in communities across the country. Their service and dedication is exemplary and their role in enhancing the lives of individuals with disabilities of all ages is vital. We are grateful that direct support professionals are always there on the front lines when we need them. The 20th Anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act, celebrated earlier this year, provides another reason to celebrate the contributions of direct support professionals. Without the services and supports provided by these professionals, it would be far more difficult to realize the important contributions made by people with disabilities in our society today. The often unheralded efforts of direct support professionals make it possible for millions of Americans with disabilities to lead meaningful lives as valued members of their communities and connected to their families. Today, more than 3 million professionals are employed in direct care occupations and demand for these workers is projected to increase by 34 percent over the next decade, mainly because of the aging of the population. By 2016, there are expected to be 1 million new positions. At 4 million, the size of this workforce will exceed other occupational categories such as K-12 teachers, cashiers, fast food workers, registered nurses, and waiters and waitresses. Although direct support professionals constitute one of the largest and fastest growing sectors of the workforce, there is a documented critical and growing shortage of these workers in every community throughout the United States. To attract future direct support professionals, HHS and Labor are coordinating to help workers acquire the skills and credentials needed to obtain good, sustainable health care jobs and advance their careers. HHS and Labor are working together to improve the quality of direct support professional jobs and stabilize this workforce on a number of fronts. Many direct support professionals are without health insurance coverage and lack the necessary training and development to do their jobs well. With the Affordable Care Act, that's changing. Many provisions will benefit direct support professionals by providing numerous opportunities to access more affordable health care and to enhance their training and development. Strategies like these will not only improve the quality of direct support professional jobs, but they will help to promote economic recovery and expand the middle class. That is why it is important to take time out during National Direct Support Professionals Week to thank direct support professionals for all they do and to remind the public just how vital our nation's direct support professionals are to the health and well-being of society. So, as you celebrate National Direct Support Professionals Week this year, we hope you will also take a few moments to reflect on some of the challenges that also face direct care work today. Direct support professionals are often familiar with what persons with disabilities and elderly individuals want and need, and respond to both. That's the power of direct care work. We commend their work and the difference they make each and every day. For more information on federal, state and local government programs and services for people with disabilities, their family members and caregivers, please visit www.disability.gov and the HHS Office on Disability's website at http://www.hhs.gov/od/."

The Brookwood-Sago grants program was established through a provision in the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006. The focus of fiscal year 2010's grants will be on training and training materials for mine emergency prevention and preparedness for all underground mines. ""Training is one of the most important components for preparing miners, rescue teams and other personnel to respond to mine emergencies,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""These grants provide a valuable opportunity to develop new training tools and techniques that will help ensure miners return home safely after every shift."" Bevill State Community College of Jasper, Ala., will receive $77,000 to develop video training modules for mine emergencies and safety scenarios that can be shown to critical response staff as well as the entire mining workforce. Additionally, the project will produce a training manual for trainees to utilize in their mine operations. Bluefield State College of Bluefield, W.Va., through its Center for Applied Research and Technology Inc., will receive $61,000 to develop two Web-enabled courses to improve conveyer belt safety training. The Colorado Department of Natural Resources will receive $57,000 to help improve the level and effectiveness of mine emergency training by networking and sharing mine emergency and MSHA-sponsored mine emergency response development training ideas and innovations with reputable mine rescue and mine emergency training organizations throughout the country. Colorado School of Mines of Golden, Colo., will receive $80,000 for mine rescue training, including simulated and actual underground rescue exercises, with a focus on effective communications and decision-making. Pennsylvania State University of State College, Pa., will receive $132,000 to develop, design, implement and evaluate a demonstration emergency prevention training program for supervisors. Training methods will incorporate traditional classroom methods, state-of-the-art video technology, written training materials and Internet-based learning. United Mine Workers Career Centers Inc. will receive $93,000 to develop an interactive computer program to train and prepare miners on escape procedures in underground coal mines. The training program will require teams to apply critical thinking in their virtual escape from a mine emergency, with teams advancing to the next level of the program based on their responses to each problem. Training grants are awarded for a 12-month performance period, and applicants must be states or nonprofit entities. The grants were named in remembrance of 13 men who died in two explosions at the Jim Walter Resources Inc. No. 5 Mine in Brookwood, Ala., in 2001, and 12 men who died in an explosion at the Sago Mine in Tallsmanville, W.Va., in 2006."
"September 16, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20100916,US Department of Labor announces final rule for Unemployment Compensation Program funding goals,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor's Employment and Training Administration today announced a final rule regarding the Unemployment Compensation Program. This rule implements federal legislation requiring the department to establish criteria for states to qualify for interest-free federal loans for the payment of unemployment compensation. ""The past few years have really tested the unemployment programs. For that reason, and the future health of unemployment trust funds, it is especially important that states make reasonable efforts to maintain the solvency of their unemployment compensation systems before receiving interest-free federal loans,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. The Social Security Act provides for the federal government to make advances to states that deplete their unemployment trust fund accounts. This arrangement ensures that eligible unemployed workers receive benefits to which they are entitled. These advances are generally interest-bearing; however, states may obtain interest-free advances under certain conditions. Under current law, states owe no interest on amounts they obtain from the federal government during a calendar year if the advances are repaid by Sept. 30 of the same year and no additional advances are made that year. The purpose of the legislation spurring today's final rule was to encourage states to adequately forward fund their unemployment compensation systems to minimize the need for advances. The final rule conditions a state's receipt of interest-free advances upon the state meeting new funding goals as well as existing requirements. The rule requires that a state: meet a solvency goal based on a generally accepted measure of trust fund solvency in at least one of the five years preceding the year the advance occurs; and has had no significant tax reductions in the years between the last that the solvency measure was met and the year in which the advance occurs. Implementation of the final rule will be phased in beginning in 2014 in order to allow states additional time to repay current advances and build sufficient reserves to meet the new requirements for interest-free loans. Full implementation will occur in 2019."

In response, Occupational Safety and Healthy Administration Assistant Secretary of Labor Dr. David Michaels, issued the following statement: ""OSHA's Whistleblower Protection Program exists because of a decades-old belief held by Congress, stakeholders, employers and society, that whistleblowers play an essential role in protecting workers and the public. ""Whistleblowers can make the difference between lawful workplaces and places where workers fear for their livelihoods and even their lives if they raise concerns. ""The leadership of the Department of Labor profoundly understands the cornerstone position that whistleblower protections have in the foundation of a strong worker protection program. ""With our available resources, OSHA is working hard to ensure that whistleblowers are protected from retaliation. We are in the process of a top-to-bottom review of OSHA's whistleblower protection program. This comprehensive review will cover policy, resources, equipment and work processes. The objective is to identify any weaknesses and inefficiencies in the program and improve the way we conduct this very important activity. In addition, we have hired additional personnel in the past year in an effort to more efficiently process cases. ""OSHA has already begun taking action on items recommended in the GAO report, such as requiring all investigators and their supervisors to complete mandatory investigator training over the next 18 months, setting strategic goals and performance measures for the whistleblower program, and providing new equipment to field staff. ""We are still studying other recommendations from the GAO, and appreciate their review and input."" OSHA enforces the whistleblower provisions of 19 laws protecting employees who report violations of various securities, trucking, airline, nuclear, pipeline, environmental, railroad, public transportation, workplace safety and health, consumer product safety, health care reform, and financial reform laws. Detailed information on employee whistleblower rights, including fact sheets, is available online at http://www.whistleblowers.gov . Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees.

"September 15, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ofccp/ofccp20100915,US Labor Department sues Tyson Fresh Meats for systemic discrimination against women,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Labor has filed an administrative complaint against Tyson Fresh Meats, the world's largest supplier of premium beef and pork and a wholly owned subsidiary of Tyson Foods Inc. The complaint alleges that Tyson systematically rejected female job applicants at its plant in Joslin, Ill. ""The Labor Department is firmly committed to ensuring that federal contractors give all individuals a fair and equal chance at employment,"" said Patricia A. Shiu, director of the department's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs. ""Taxpayer dollars must never be used to discriminate. In our efforts to uncover workplace discrimination, OFCCP will utilize a host of remedies, including debarment, to protect workers, promote diversity and enforce the law."" OFCCP's investigation revealed that Tyson utilized a hiring process and selection procedures that discriminated against women seeking entry-level positions. Executive Order 11246, under which this lawsuit was brought, prohibits federal contractors such as Tyson from discriminating on the basis of gender when making their hiring decisions and empowers OFCCP to monitor their compliance with the law. The complaint requests that all of Tyson's federal contracts be canceled; it be debarred from future government contracts until it has remedied the violations; and it provide complete relief, including lost wages, interest and other benefits of employment, to affected individuals. OFCCP believes that more than 750 women are owed back wages and more than 100 women should be given the option of working for the company. This filing follows recent litigation by OFCCP involving another Tyson Foods Inc. subsidiary, TNT Crust, located in Green Bay, Wis. A Department of Labor administrative law judge found that TNT Crust systematically discriminated against Latino applicants in its entry-level position hiring. In addition to Executive Order 11246, OFCCP's legal authority exists under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974. As amended, these three laws hold those who do business with the federal government, both contractors and subcontractors, to the very reasonable standard that they not discriminate in their employment practices on the basis of gender, race, color, religion, national origin, disability or status as a protected veteran.

Solis today issued the following statement on National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week: ""President Obama declared this week National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week. I join him in celebrating the tremendous achievements of HBCUs and the many contributions that these institutions of higher learning and their graduates have made to our nation. ""HBCUs were born to provide a way forward when the path for African-Americans and other people of color was blocked by the vestiges of slavery and Jim Crow. As pillars of American academia and society as whole, HBCUs have produced some of the world's foremost doctors, lawyers, engineers, educators, inventors, literary greats and public officials. American icons such as Dr. Martin Luther King, Thurgood Marshall, Oprah Winfrey, Vice Adm. Dr. Regina Benjamin – and countless others who have helped shape American history – hail from HBCUs. In fact, the impact of HBCU graduates extends across the nation and around the globe. ""On a personal level, I have had the honor of working with such HBCU alumni as Reps. Gregory Meeks, Kendrick Meek, Elijah Cummings, Danny Davis, Corrine Brown, James Clyburn, Jesse Jackson Jr., Emanuel Cleaver, Edolphus Towns, John Lewis, Bennie Thompson and David Scott, among others. Each one is a great example of the high caliber of leadership that HBCUs have helped bring to American public service. ""Today, as the secretary of labor, I also look to HBCUs as key partners in training America's workforce. Many HBCUs are leading producers of African-Americans in the science, technology, engineering and mathematical areas – a skill set of great importance to America in this century. ""HBCUs are truly a critical part of our past, our present and our future, and I proudly join President Barack Obama in saluting them this week."""

Solis today announced a $10 million grant to fund a new Framework of Action to eliminate the worst forms of child labor in the cocoa industry in Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire. Together the two countries supply more than half of the world's cocoa. Labor Minister E.T. Mensah of Ghana, Labor Minister Emile Guirieoulou of Cote d'Ivoire, and representatives of the international chocolate and cocoa industry joined Secretary Solis in making renewed commitments of resources to address the problem. Secretary Solis thanked Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa and Rep. Eliot Engel of New York, architects of a 2001 agreement with the cocoa industry to eliminate the worst forms of child labor in that industry, known as the Harkin-Engel Protocol. She applauded their tireless advocacy and leadership to help children around the world. Since 1995, Congress has appropriated approximately $780 million to the U.S. Department of Labor to support efforts to combat exploitive child labor around the world, resulting in the rescue of approximately 1.4 million children from the worst forms of child labor. The Harkin-Engel Protocol represents a commitment by the industry to grow and process cocoa beans and derivative products in compliance with International Labor Organization Convention 182. ""Child labor perpetuates a cycle of poverty that prevents families and nations from reaching their full potential,"" said Secretary Solis. ""This new Framework of Action will focus on tackling household poverty so parents do not have to rely on their children's labor."" The initiative will rescue children from the worst forms of child labor, give them access to the education and other services they need, and work to improve the livelihoods of cocoa-growing families and their communities. The governments of Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire committed resources, personnel and policy support for the initiative, which emphasizes joint planning and coordination of efforts on the ground to achieve maximum impact. The international chocolate and cocoa industry pledged $7 million to the new Framework of Action, and Secretary Solis encouraged industry representatives to redouble efforts to match the full $10 million in new funding that is being provided by the U.S. Department of Labor. The department will work through the International Labor Organization's International Program on the Elimination of Child Labor to help the countries build community-based monitoring systems to uncover the worst forms of child labor, determine the causes and provide remedies. Following the announcement, the group met to refine strategies and plans to implement the new framework.

Department of Labor’s Employee Benefits Security Administration today announced that the owner of a Pasadena spa and salon has been indicted on federal charges that he embezzled thousands of dollars from his employees’ 401(k) profit-sharing plan. Joseph Wong of Rowland Heights, president and owner of Pasadena, Calif.-based Amadeus Salon Inc., was indicted by a grand jury on Sept. 3. The eight-count indictment alleges that Wong embezzled from an employee benefit plan covered under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, commonly known as ERISA. Each count in the indictment carries a maximum statutory penalty of five years in federal prison. According to the indictment, Wong withheld more than $26,000 from his employees’ paychecks for the purpose of forwarding the money to a company-sponsored retirement plan between 2004 and 2008. Instead of forwarding the money, Wong allegedly kept and used it for his own benefit. Wong was arrested at his home on Sept. 7, held overnight at the Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown Los Angeles, and arraigned the following day. At his arraignment, Wong pleaded not guilty to the charges in the indictment, and he was released on a $50,000 bond. Wong’s trial is scheduled to begin on Oct. 19 in U.S. district court. “This criminal action demonstrates the Labor Department’s resolve to vigorously enforce the law to ensure that those who steal from contributory employee benefit plans are brought to justice,” said Crisanta Johnson, director of EBSA’s Los Angeles Regional Office. “We will aggressively investigate plan theft under our Contributory Plans Criminal Project, which targets those who prey on plan participants and beneficiaries.” The case against Wong was investigated by the EBSA office in Los Angeles with assistance from the Labor Department’s Office of the Inspector General. The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Cheryl O’Connor. The indictment of a person by a grand jury is an accusation only and that person is presumed innocent until and unless proven guilty. U.S. v.

The grants will assist these organizations in providing safety and health training, and educational programs for workers and employers. ""Ensuring that workers and employers have the information they need is critical to safe and healthy workplaces,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""These grants will help provide training and education aimed at identifying hazards, understanding rights and responsibilities, protecting health and saving lives."" The Susan Harwood Capacity Building Grants support training programs that educate workers and employers in industries with high injury and fatality rates; low literacy, young, limited English proficiency and otherwise vulnerable workers; and small business employers. They fund long-term programs that build safety and health competency within organizations. OSHA awarded approximately $6.7 million to 30 organizations already providing occupational safety and health training, education and related assistance to their constituents, and that are seeking to expand and develop their capacity. Another $1.3 million in smaller pilot grants was awarded to 15 organizations that seek to lay the groundwork for a robust safety and health education program. The agency received a total of 166 applications for the capacity building grants. ""The programs funded by these grants will have a long-lasting, positive impact on workers and employers alike,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for OSHA Dr. David Michaels. ""OSHA also has significantly reached out to non-English speaking, and historically hard to reach, vulnerable workers by awarding grants to organizations committed to serving those groups."" The training grants are named in honor of the late Susan Harwood, a former director of the Office of Risk Assessment in OSHA's health standards directorate, who died in 1996. The programs receiving grants are designed to prevent work- related injuries, illnesses and deaths by providing the knowledge and tools that workers and employers need to identify and correct workplace safety and health hazards. This grant program is an important component of OSHA's efforts to provide workers in high-risk industries with training about job hazards and their rights. It also provides employers with crucial information about unsafe working conditions, mitigation strategies and their responsibilities under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970.

"September 3, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20100903,US Department of Labors OSHA fines Alabama lumber company for violations following worker death,"PHENIX CITY , Ala. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration has cited MDLG, doing business as Phenix Lumber Co., for 53 safety and health violations following the death of one worker and the critical injury of a second at its Phenix City facility. Proposed penalties total $439,400. ""Phenix Lumber failed to protect its workers from death and serious injury,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for OSHA Dr. David Michaels. ""Employers are legally bound to provide a safe work environment for their employees. This company has repeatedly failed to do so, costing one worker his life and grievously injuring another. This must stop."" In March, OSHA inspectors opened a follow-up joint safety and health inspection to verify abatement from a previous visit that identified failure-to-abate violations. Before OSHA could conclude its review, one worker was killed when his head was crushed between a motor being hoisted with a forklift and other equipment. Another worker was seriously injured after he fell approximately 10 feet, breaking his neck, while doing daily maintenance on the debarker in the saw mill. In connection with the fatality, Phenix Lumber has been issued one willful and five serious safety and health citations for permitting a worker to stand under an elevated portion of a powered industrial truck allowing a crushing injury. In relation to the fall resulting in critical injury, the company has been issued one willful, one repeat and one serious safety citation for not providing guardrails and fall protection, and not having a means to disconnect a rotor motor. The follow-up inspection additionally resulted in the company being issued two failure-to-abate, 11 repeat, 21 serious and 10 other-than-serious safety and health citations for other violations. Those violations include failing to provide energy control procedures for equipment and machinery that require more than one lockout device, failing to provide proper electrical enclosures around live conductors and allowing ignitable or combustible dust to accumulate. ""Phenix Lumber has a history of saying it will correct its safety deficiencies, yet continues to allow a hazardous environment for its workers,"" said Cindy Coe, regional administrator for OSHA in Atlanta, Ga. ""This horrendous situation cannot continue and will not be tolerated."" The company has 15 business days from receipt of the citations and proposed penalties to comply, request an informal conference with OSHA's area director or contest the findings before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. The site was inspected by staff from OSHA's area office, 1141 Montlimar Drive, Suite 10006, Mobile, AL 36609; telephone 251-441-6131. Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. OSHA's role is to assure these conditions for America's working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education and assistance.

"September 3, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20100903,Statement of Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis on August employment numbers,"WASHINGTON – Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis issued the following statement on the August 2010 Employment Situation report released today: ""This past August, the economy gained 67,000 jobs in the private sector, and the unemployment rate increased to 9.6 percent. Total nonfarm employment declined by 54,000 over the month, as 114,000 temporary census jobs wrapped up between July and August and more than offset the private sector job gains. ""We have now added private sector jobs for eight straight months, totaling 763,000 private sector jobs since the beginning of the year. While we need to pick up the pace of recovery, erase the job losses and get Americans back to work, this encouraging growth shows that we are headed in the right direction. ""As soon as we took office, this administration took action to stop the economic bleeding. To help put people back to work, we passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which already has saved or created more than 2.5 million American jobs. The actions this administration undertook helped our economy grow for four consecutive quarters. ""It's important to remember how far we've come. When this administration took office, we were losing 750,000 jobs each month. The question was whether we'd enter another depression. This year, we've averaged 95,000 private sector jobs added each month, and the debate is about the pace of the recovery. But we know we still have a ways to go. ""To support growth, it is critical to support our small businesses, which are key drivers of our economic recovery. Indeed, two out of every three jobs created in our economy are created by small businesses. So far, this administration has helped pass eight different tax cuts for small businesses, and we know there is more we can do to help. The Small Business Jobs Act, pending in the Senate, would provide a set of tax breaks and lending incentives to spur investment and hiring by small businesses. It would accelerate $55 billion of tax relief to encourage American businesses, small and large, to expand their investments over the next 14 months. We join the president, small business leaders and those Americans looking for work, and call upon the Senate to pass this critical piece of legislation to ensure that we continue on the path of recovery. ""At the Department of Labor, we continue to provide essential tools to help job seekers find employment. We recognize that in a tough labor market it can be difficult for the jobless to figure out what jobs they are most qualified for, or what kind of training can help workers successfully transition into a new career. So, this Labor Day we are unveiling ""mySkills myFuture"" a new online tool to help job seekers do just that. By visiting http://www.myskillsmyfuture.org , job seekers can see exactly what skills and training they need, find local training and education providers, and view real job postings in their area. ""Without a doubt, we are climbing out of this recession and are on the road to recovery. The president and I have confidence in the American economy, and we have confidence in the American people. We will continue fighting every day to keep this economy moving forward."""

Silva Inc. to recover workers' health and pension benefits contributions","Turlock, California – The U.S. Department of Labor has sued D. L. Silva Inc., Daniel Silva, Dennette Dores and the estate of Dennis Silva for allegedly failing to remit or collect $104,513 in employee and employer contributions owed to the company's plan in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The plan provides health and pension benefits to as many as 19 company employees. The company, which also operated as Custom Air, was in the business of performing heating, ventilation and air conditioning services for residential, commercial and tract housing. The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California, alleges that the company, Daniel Silva, Dennette Dores and the late Dennis Silva failed to timely segregate and remit to the plan $22,559 in employee contributions from January 2006 through March 2007, and failed to collect and remit $81,954 in Davis-Bacon prevailing wage fringe benefit contributions owed to the plan from February 2005 through March 2007. The suit seeks a court order to require that the defendants restore to the plan all losses with interest and to permanently bar Daniel Silva and Dennette Dores from serving as fiduciaries or service providers to any plan governed by ERISA. The suit also seeks to appoint an independent fiduciary to administer and terminate the plan, if appropriate. ""Plan officials have a duty to manage and protect employees' benefit plans and their assets,"" said Jean Ackerman, regional director of the department's Employee Benefit Security Administration San Francisco Regional Office, which investigated this case.

Six miners were killed while working in close proximity to mining or haulage equipment. Three more miners lost their lives in explosions and fires; another miner was killed when he was caught inside rotating machinery. Eight of the dead miners were contractors, including one who fell to his death; and one who was killed when his truck went through a berm and over a highwall. One miner drowned in a dredge pond.

In response to the request, the assistant secretary of labor for occupational safety and health, Dr. David Michaels, today issued the following statement: ""We are very concerned about medical residents working extremely long hours, and we know of evidence linking sleep deprivation with an increased risk of needle sticks, puncture wounds, lacerations, medical errors and motor vehicle accidents. We will review and consider the petition on this subject submitted by Public Citizen and others. ""The relationship of long hours, worker fatigue and safety is a concern beyond medical residents, since there is extensive evidence linking fatigue with operator error. In its investigation of the root causes of the BP Texas City oil refinery explosion in 2005, in which 15 workers were killed and approximately 170 injured, the U.S. Chemical Safety Board identified worker fatigue and long work hours as a likely contributing factor to the explosion.

"September 2, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20100902,"MSHA reminds mining industry about miners right to make hazardous condition complaints, protections against discrimination","ARLINGTON, Va. The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration today announced the release of two new program information bulletins pertaining to the rights of miners who make hazardous condition complaints and request inspections, as well as miners' protections against discrimination. MSHA decided to distribute these guidelines based on testimony delivered in May during a House Education and Labor Committee hearing in Beckley, W.Va., as well as testimony delivered during recent Senate hearings. Statements from family members of miners who died in the April 5, 2010, explosion at Upper Big Branch Mine indicated that workers who had expressed concerns over safety conditions existing prior to the deadly blast feared retaliation by mine management. Section 103(g)(1) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 provides that a miner or miners' representative has the right to obtain an immediate MSHA inspection if there are reasonable grounds to believe that an imminent danger, a violation of the Mine Act, or a violation of a mandatory safety or health standard exists. The agency will conduct a special inspection to determine if a violation or danger exists, issue a citation or order as appropriate, and take all reasonable steps to maintain and assure the confidentiality of the complainant. MSHA maintains an anonymous hotline to report hazardous conditions. The phone number is 800-746-1553. Persons may also report hazardous conditions at the nearest MSHA district office or online at http://www.msha.gov , and MSHA will promptly launch an investigation. ""Miners have a right to identify hazardous conditions and refuse unsafe work without fear of discrimination,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""The more people participate actively in mine safety, the better."" Section 105(c) of the Mine Act prohibits individuals from discriminating against miners; applicants for employment and representatives of miners for exercising statutory rights, especially concerning safety or health activities such as identifying hazards; requesting MSHA inspections; or refusing to engage in unsafe work. ""MSHA will vigorously investigate all discrimination complaints against miners,"" said Main. ""We will not hesitate to seek more substantial civil penalties against mine operators who repeatedly discriminate against miners as a deterrent to future such illegal acts."" Among the most common forms of discrimination the Mine Act prohibits are discharge, suspension, loss of pay, demotion, changes in pay and changes in work hours, as well as reduction in benefits, vacation, bonuses, overtime or rates of pay. The Mine Act also protects miners against more subtle forms of interference, such as intimidation or threats of reprisal. Since January 2009, MSHA has received 3,951 hazard condition complaints and 289 discrimination complaints. MSHA recently revised its publication ""A Guide to Miners' Rights and Responsibilities under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977."" As the title suggests, the booklet summarizes the rights guaranteed all miners under the Mine Act as well as the responsibility of all miners to take an active role in matters of mine safety and health. The publication is available at http://www.msha.gov/S&HINFO/minersrights/minersrights.asp . Other resources at this site include a miners' rights tri-fold brochure and pocket card, an online hazardous condition complaint form, an online notification of miners' representative form and a discrimination complaint packet."

The citations allege the company knowingly exposed workers to lead hazards and violated federal workplace safety and health standards at its Blandon facility. Proposed penalties total $550,400. ""The employer deliberately refused to protect workers from overexposure to lead and other workplace hazards. Even though company management knew of the OSHA requirements and the workers' lead exposures, it failed to provide medical surveillance to monitor worker health and to train its workers about lead-exposure risks,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for OSHA Dr. David Michaels. ""OSHA will use the full extent of the law to ensure employers are held accountable for failing to protect workers."" Following its investigation, OSHA cited Excelsior Brass Works for willful and serious violations of the lead standard, which requires employers to protect their workers from lead exposure. Lead can cause brain damage, paralysis, kidney disease and even death. The willful citations allege the company did not take air samples as required for workers who were over-exposed to airborne lead, and it did not provide the required annual training about lead-exposure hazards. Willful citations also allege failures to provide the required medical surveillance for the lead-exposed workers and to make available the results of medical tests performed shortly after OSHA came to the facility and opened the inspection. An additional willful violation alleges that the company stopped providing hearing tests to employees over-exposed to noise. Willful violations are those committed with intentional, knowing or voluntary disregard for legal requirements, or plain indifference to employee safety and health. Serious citations of the lead standards allege failures to install additional engineering controls; to have an updated, written lead compliance program; to store lead-contaminated clothing in a closed container; to maintain surfaces like microwaves and lunchroom floors free of lead dust; to vacuum clothes to remove lead dust before entering the lunchroom; to provide medical exams to employees with high blood-lead levels; and to maintain proper air sampling records. Additional serious citations allege that the employer failed to install engineering controls for noise; establish a written respirator program; to provide respirator fit-tests; and establish a program with procedures to shut down and lock out hazardous energy sources before servicing and maintaining machines. OSHA issues a serious citation when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result and the employer knew, or should have known, of the hazard. Two other-than-serious violations, accounting for $1,200 of the total penalties, allege recordkeeping deficiencies. Excelsior Brass Works, with six previous OSHA inspections at its Blandon facility, manufactures brass and bronze castings. The company has 15 business days from receipt of the citations to comply, request an informal conference with OSHA's area director, or contest the citations and proposed penalties before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. The investigation was conducted by OSHA's office in Harrisburg, Pa; telephone: 717-782-3902. To report workplace accidents, fatalities or situations posing imminent danger to workers, call OSHA's toll-free hotline at 800-321-5742. Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees.

"September 1, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20100901,US Labor Departments OSHA issues fine exceeding $3 million against Whitesell Corp. for safety and health violations at 2 Alabama factories,"BIRMINGHAM , Ala. The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration today fined Whitesell Corp. $3,071,500 and cited the company with 72 safety and health violations for exposing workers to amputation hazards and other problems at its manufacturing plants in Tuscumbia and Muscle Shoals, Ala. ""Whitesell willfully tampered with the safety mechanisms of its hydraulic forging presses at its Tuscumbia plant to speed up production, resulting in the amputation of a worker's hand,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""Companies like Whitesell that value short-term gain over their workers' safety will be held responsible for their reckless actions."" OSHA began an inspection of the Tuscumbia plant in March after receiving a report that a worker's hand had been amputated. Due to the seriousness of the hazards noted during that initial visit, the inspection was expanded to a comprehensive safety and health inspection of the facility. Three weeks later the inspection was again expanded to include the Muscle Shoals plant due to the probability that similar hazards existed at that location. ""This employer knowingly exposed these workers to serious injuries,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for OSHA Dr. David Michaels. ""The objective of OSHA's actions today is to save the hands, and perhaps the lives, of other workers in the future."" Regarding the Tuscumbia plant, OSHA is proposing $986,500 in penalties for 13 willful and five serious safety violations, as well as one willful, one serious and two other-than-serious health violations. The willful safety violations address management's failure to develop and utilize lockout/tagout procedures of energy sources for employees engaged in maintenance activities on hydraulic forging presses and bypassing a safety feature intended to protect workers. The serious safety citations concern hazards with machines lacking mechanical guards and electrical hazards. Health citations include management's failure to provide engineering or administrative controls for workers exposed to high noise hazards and to provide audiograms for those employees. OSHA is proposing $2,085,000 in penalties regarding the Muscle Shoals plant for 28 willful and 16 serious safety violations, and one willful and five serious health violations. The willful safety violations address this plant's failure to develop and utilize lockout/tagout procedures for the plant's mechanical forging presses and to lock out mechanical forging presses when dies are changed or maintenance is performed. The serious citations are related to obstructed exit routes, various machine guarding hazards and electrical hazards. Health citations include a willful violation for management's failure to provide audiograms for employees exposed to noise hazards. The serious violations address failure to implement controls for employees exposed to the noise hazards, as well as electrical deficiencies and lack of hazard communication. OSHA issues a willful citation when it finds a violation committed with plain indifference to or intentional disregard for legal requirements or employee safety and health. A serious citation is issued when death or serious physical harm is likely to result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known. The Tuscumbia plant employs about 17 workers and manufactures parts used in the automotive, lawn care and home appliance industries. The Muscle Shoals plant employs about 103 workers and manufactures fasteners. Whitesell employs about 1,000 workers corporate-wide and has about 25 locations combined in Michigan, Iowa, Alabama, Canada and Asia. The company has 15 business days from receipt of the citations and proposed penalties to comply, request an informal conference with OSHA's area director or contest the findings before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. The sites were inspected by staff from OSHA's area office located at 950 22nd St. N., Room 1050, Birmingham, AL 35203; telephone 205-731-1534. To report workplace accidents, fatalities or situations posing imminent danger to workers, call OSHA's toll-free hotline at 800-321-6742. Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. OSHA's role is to assure these conditions for America's working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education and assistance.

"September 1, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20100901-1,US Labor Department announces interim final rules and invites public comment on whistleblower procedures,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration has published interim final rules that will help protect workers who voice safety, health and security concerns. The regulations, which establish procedures for handling worker retaliation complaints, allow filing by phone as well as in writing and filing in languages other than English. ""When workers believe their employers are violating certain laws or government regulations, they have the right to file a complaint and should not fear retaliation. Silenced workers are not safe workers,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for OSHA Dr. David Michaels. ""Changes in the whistleblower provisions make good on the promise to stand by those workers who have the courage to come forward when they believe their employer is violating the law and cutting corners on a variety of safety, health and security concerns in the affected industries."" The regulations, which cover workers filing complaints in the railroad, public transit, commercial motor carrier and consumer product industries, also create greater consistency among various OSHA complaint procedures. The interim final rules establish procedures and time frames for handling complaints under the whistleblower sections of the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 and the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008. Comments must be submitted by Nov. 1, 2010. They may be submitted electronically at http://www.regulations.gov , the federal e-rulemaking portal, or by mail or fax. OSHA enforces the whistleblower provisions of the OSH Act and 18 other statutes protecting employees who report violations of various commercial motor carrier, airline, nuclear power, pipeline, environmental, railroad, public transportation, securities and health care reform laws. New fact sheets on these statutes and additional information will be available at http://www.whistleblowers.gov .

"September 1, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20100901-0,US Department of Labors OSHA cites Houston manufacturing company for hiding work-related injuries and illnesses; fines exceed $1.2 million,"HOUSTON – The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration has issued Goodman Manufacturing Co. LP 83 willful citations for failing to record and improperly recording work-related injuries and illnesses at the company's Houston air conditioning cooling facility. Proposed penalties total $1,215,000. ""Accurate workplace injury and illness records are vital tools for identifying hazards and protecting workers' health and safety,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""Workers and employers need this information to recognize patterns of injuries and illnesses, and prevent future hazards."" OSHA's Houston North Area Office began its investigation March 2 in response to a complaint alleging that Goodman Manufacturing was not properly recording workplace injuries and illnesses in violation of OSHA's regulations. The investigation determined that Goodman had either not recorded or failed to properly record the nature and/or duration of 72 percent of employee injuries and illnesses from January 2008 to March 15, 2010, on its log. Although Goodman was extremely knowledgeable about OSHA recordkeeping requirements, it made many unsupportable decisions that resulted in the deficiencies found by the agency. With regard to the injuries and illnesses improperly recorded, important information reflecting severity, such as the time away from work, was grossly incorrect. ""OSHA takes these violations extremely seriously,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for OSHA Dr. David Michaels. ""OSHA needs accurate data to effectively target its inspections and resources, and to measure the impact of OSHA's actions on workplace safety. Employers and workers need to understand how important accurate data are to workplace safety and health."" OSHA defines a willful violation as one committed with plain indifference to or intentional disregard for OSHA's requirements or employee safety and health. The company has 15 business days from receipt of the citations to comply, request an informal conference with OSHA's area director in Houston, or contest the citations and penalties before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. Employers and employees with questions about workplace safety and health standards can call OSHA's Houston North Area Office at 281-591-2438 or its Houston South Area Office at 281-286-0583. To report workplace accidents, fatalities or situations posing imminent danger to workers, call OSHA's toll-free hotline at 800-321-6742. Apart from this particular investigation, OSHA has implemented a National Emphasis Program on Recordkeeping to assess the accuracy of injury and illness recorded by employers.

"August 31, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20100831,US Department of Labor announces final rule for Senior Community Service Employment Program,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor's Employment and Training Administration today announced a final rule regarding the Senior Community Service Employment Program. The final rule strengthens program aspects that will benefit unemployed, low-income older Americans who want to enter or re-enter the workforce. The rule will be effective on Oct.1. The Senior Community Service Employment Program authorized by Title V of the Older Americans Act is the only federally-sponsored employment and training program targeted specifically to unemployed, low-income seniors. The program has dual goals of promoting community service and helping SCSEP participants achieve economic self-sufficiency by guiding them into unsubsidized employment, where appropriate. ""This new rule will make it possible for grantees to support older workers through job training programs that will ultimately help them enter or re-enter the workforce,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Employment and Training Jane Oates. ""We took feedback provided from the public very seriously and incorporated it into this final rulemaking."" The final rule promulgates the 2006 amendments to the OAA, which include a new 48-month limitation on participation, and an increase in available funds for training and supportive services. The final rule implements the statute's requirements that national SCSEP grants be re-competed regularly – generally every four years – and that a state compete its SCSEP grant if the current grantee fails to meet its core performance goals for three consecutive years. In addition, the 2006 OAA establishes new funding opportunities for pilot, demonstration and evaluation projects; expands the priority-for-service categories; and modifies how the program determines income eligibility. Major changes from the notice of proposed rulemaking to the final rule, based on input from grantees and the public, include the following: The elimination of the one-year, one-time restriction on extensions of individual participation. The elimination of the 1,300-hour annual participant time limit. The reinforcement of the dual goals of SCSEP, as well as the focus on services that are appropriate to individual participants."

S. Department of Labor has sued the owner of M.S. Molitor Trucking Inc. and M.D. Service LLC of Boulder, Mont., for failure to timely deposit $144,398.49 in delinquent employee contributions owed to the company’s SIMPLE IRA plans in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The companies ceased operations as of Dec. 1, 2008. Michael P. Molitor allegedly failed to timely remit $116,578.10 in contributions deducted from employees’ paychecks and lost interest to the M.S. Molitor Trucking plan from September 2004 through March 2008, of which $51,137.81 still has not been deposited into the plan. As a result of Molitor’s improper actions, the plan’s participants allegedly lost $14,617.54 in interest. Over the same time periods, Molitor allegedly failed to timely forward $27,820.39 to the M.D. Service plan, including $12,145.06 that has not yet been forwarded to the plan. Participants of this plan allegedly lost $4,206.41 in interest as a result of Molitor’s improper actions. Filed in the US District Court for the District of Montana, the suit seeks to recover all money owed to the two plans and any lost opportunity interest. The suit also asks the court to permanently enjoin Molitor from serving as a fiduciary or service provider to any employee benefit plan subject to ERISA. “This lawsuit underscores the Labor Department’s commitment to hold accountable those who are entrusted with the assets of workers’ retirement plans,” said Steve Eischen, director of the Kansas City Regional Office of the department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration. Employers and workers can reach EBSA’s Kansas City office at 816-285-1800 or toll-free at 866-444-3272 for help with problems relating to private sector retirement and health plans.

""Focusing on transition-age youth is an important part of addressing the under-representation of people with disabilities in the labor force,"" said Kathleen Martinez, assistant secretary of labor for the Office of Disability Employment Policy. ""Many youth with disabilities still don't have access to age-appropriate experiences, especially when it comes to work. We are working to change this at ODEP."" NCWD/Youth focuses its technical assistance efforts on state and local workforce development systems and assists them in better serving youth with disabilities. NCWD/Youth and its partners, including experts in disability, education, employment, and workforce development, strive to ensure that policy makers, youth service professionals, educators, families and youth receive cutting edge information on the connection between education, employment and independent living. The Current Population Survey conducted by the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics reports the July 2010 employment rate for individuals ages 16 to 19 at 14.6 percent, compared to 17.7 percent for same-aged peers without disabilities. Additionally, BLS reports an employment rate of 32.7 percent for individuals age 20 to 24 compared to 64.1 percent for the same age group with no disabilities. In September 2007, the Labor Department competitively awarded IEL a 24-month cooperative agreement for $1,850,000 with three option years to manage a consortium for developing effective practices and policies to enhance employment opportunities for youth with disabilities. The other members of the consortium include the National Association of Workforce Development Professionals in Washington, DC; the PACER Center in Minneapolis, Minn.; the Center on Education and Work at the University of Wisconsin-Madison; and the University of Minnesota’s Institute for Community Integration in Minneapolis.

Among the proposed changes are: A requirement that applicants provide interested persons with a brief objective summary of complex transactions. The consolidation of exemption policies and guidance within a single document. An updated description of the department's authority to propose and issue administrative exemptions on its own motion. A description of the current standards for obtaining retroactive exemption relief.

"August 30, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20100830,U.S. Labor Department sues San Jose firm and owner to recover workers' retirement assets,"San Jose, California – The U. S. Department of Labor sued Mili Group Inc. of San Jose, and its owner for allegedly misusing retirement plan assets for their own benefit, in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The suit alleges that between 2006 and 2009, Cuong Do and his company improperly authorized at least $297,040 in withdrawals and loans from the retirement plan and used $247,900 in plan assets to purchase a condominium in Florida for the benefit of the defendants. The suit also alleges they failed to deposit to the retirement plan accounts between $15,000 and $20,000 in rental income from the condominium. As relief, the department is seeking a court order to require that Do and the company restore to the plan any losses resulting from the unlawful transactions, to remove them as fiduciaries of the retirement plan, and bar the defendants from serving as fiduciaries or service providers to any plan governed by ERISA. In addition, the suit asks the court to appoint an independent fiduciary to manage and administer the plan and, if necessary, wind down the affairs of the retirement plan. In a separate legal action, the Labor Department filed an adversary complaint in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to prevent Do from discharging the debt that he owes to the retirement plan due to his alleged violations of ERISA. That complaint, filed in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California, alleges that Do used the plan’s assets to benefit himself and his company. Both legal actions resulted from an investigation conducted by the San Francisco Office of the department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration. “Plan officials have a duty to manage and protect employees’ benefit plans and their assets,” said Jean Ackerman, EBSA’s regional director in San Francisco. “Our action today is designed to restore to the plan assets that were not properly preserved for the company’s workers.” In fiscal year 2009, EBSA achieved monetary results of $1.3 billion related to the pension, 401(k), health and other benefits for millions of American workers and their families. Employers and workers can reach the San Francisco office at 415.625.2481 or toll-free number at 866.444.3272, for help with problems relating to private sector retirement and health plans. Employers with similar problems who are not yet the subject of investigations by EBSA may be eligible to participate in the department’s Voluntary Fiduciary Correction Program. Participation in the program requires employers to correct any violations but allows them to avoid EBSA enforcement actions and civil penalties as well as any applicable excise taxes.

"August 26, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20100826,US Department of Labor announces Notice of Proposed Rule Making addressing goals and requirements of YouthBuild program,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor's Employment and Training Administration today announced a Notice of Proposed Rule Making regarding the department's YouthBuild program. The YouthBuild Transfer Act was signed into law in September 2006, transferring the administration of the YouthBuild program from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to the Department of Labor. The NPRM seeks to clarify the requirements of the Transfer Act for YouthBuild program providers and participants. The proposed rule intends to better enable YouthBuild program providers to carry out the goals of the program, to assist at-risk youth in obtaining a high school diploma or GED and to help participants acquire occupational skills training that lead to employment. Interested persons are invited to submit comments on this proposed rule via the federal e-rulemaking portal at http://www.regulations.gov . Comments on the NPRM are due on Oct. 26, 2010. YouthBuild is a non-residential, grants-based alternative education program that provides classroom instructionand construction skills training to at-risk individuals ages 16-24. Participants learn valuable skills as they build or rehabilitate housing for low-income or homeless individuals and families in their communities. The NPRM incorporates changes made to the YouthBuild program by the Transfer Act. In addition to transferring the administration of the program from HUD to the Labor Department, the Transfer Act expands the training authorized under the YouthBuild program to include many activities supported by the Workforce Investment Act Title I youth formula program. The Transfer Act incorporates technical modifications to the YouthBuild program to make it consistent with WIA's job training, education, and employment goals, while at the same time continuing to enable many of the same affordable housing goals emphasized under HUD's administration of the program. Examples of other proposed changes to the YouthBuild program included in the NPRM: Participant Safety : Additional requirements for participant safety, as well as reporting requirements for safety measures. Credential Attainment : Increased emphasis on the education and occupational skills training provided by YouthBuild programs and the provision of industry recognized credentials. Registered Apprenticeships : Increased emphasis on providing training in coordination with registered apprenticeship programs, which can lead to certifications that meet industry standards."
"August 26, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/owcp/owcp20100826,US Labor Department reaches $6 billion in benefits paid under the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Labor today announced that it has paid more than $6 billion in compensation and medical benefits to more than 61,400 claimants nationwide under the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act. This milestone coincides with the 9th anniversary of the Labor Department's administration of the EEOICPA, which assists employees who became ill as a result of working in the nuclear weapons industry. ""The Labor Department is charged with compensating eligible nuclear weapons workers and their survivors. I am very proud to announce that we have delivered more than $6 billion in compensation and medical benefits during the nine years we have administered the EEOICPA,"" said Shelby Hallmark, director of the Labor Department's Office of Workers' Compensation Programs. ""It is with great pride that we mark this payment milestone. In the future we will continue focusing on delivering excellent customer service to the nuclear weapons community by strengthening the claims adjudication process, our timeliness in delivering benefits and our outreach campaigns."" On July 31, 2001, the Labor Department began administering Part B of the EEOICPA. Part B covers current or former workers who have been diagnosed with cancers, beryllium disease, or silicosis, and whose illness was caused by exposure to radiation, beryllium or silica while working directly for the U.S. Department of Energy, Energy Department contractors and subcontractors, designated atomic weapons employers and beryllium vendors. Since 2001, the Labor Department has delivered $3.4 billion in compensation to nearly 42,000 claimants under Part B of the EEOICPA. Part E, created by an amendment to the EEOICPA on Oct. 28, 2004, provides federal compensation and medical benefits to contractors and subcontractors of the Energy Department who worked at covered facilities and sustained an illness as a result of exposure to toxic substances. Under the Labor Department's administration, the Part E compensation payout has exceeded $2 billion. Medical benefits under both Parts B and E of the EEOICPA total nearly $556 million. It is the Labor Department's goal to disseminate information concerning EEOICPA benefits to potentially eligible claimants across the country. In June of this year, the Labor Department sponsored town hall meetings in Las Vegas, Nev., and Livermore and Emeryville, Calif., to inform workers and their survivors about three new classes of former employees from the Nevada Test Site, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory recently added to the EEOICPA's Special Exposure Cohort. The Labor Department's Traveling Resource Center goes monthly to Kayenta, Ariz., and Shiprock, N.M., to assist individuals with the filing of their claims under the EEOICPA. Further, 11 stationary resource centers continue to play an active role in outreach efforts and provide personal assistance to claimants with filing claims and conducting occupational health interviews.

The department’s lawsuit alleges that between January and September of 2007 the companies failed to timely forward $25,752.04 to the savings plan in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and the governing plan documents. The 401(k) plan allowed employees to contribute up to 4 percent of their compensation, which was required to be matched 100 percent by the company. The missing deposits included $13,027.21 in employee contributions, $2,986.53 in participant loan repayments and $9,738.30 in matching company contributions. “Workers are counting on these funds for their retirement, and it is unconscionable that an employer would take these funds for his own benefit,” said R.C. Marshall, director of the Atlanta Regional Office of the Employee Benefits Security Administration in Georgia. A suit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida asks the court to order the defendants to restore all losses, including interest and lost opportunity costs, offset the individual plan accounts of any defendant against the losses owed to the plan, and permanently bar them from serving as fiduciaries of any plan subject to ERISA. The suit also seeks the appointment of an independent fiduciary to administer the plan. Angell Contracting and Construction and its related companies specialized in commercial and residential real estate construction in the Tampa Bay area.

Armed with this new data, researchers, disability advocates, and policy makers can better project labor force participation for working-aged persons with disabilities. U.S. Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis stated, ""I am pleased that the data released today will help better tailor policies and workforce development strategies, leveraging the talents and skills of this important segment of our population. According to recent data from the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics, just one in five people with disabilities were in the labor force and the unemployment rate for those with disabilities remains much higher than the national average. We will use this new information to help increase service capacity and accessibility to workforce development systems including the one-stop-career centers and ensure that people with disabilities have access to employment support, transportation, housing, and other support services. We will make sure that people who want to work can work."" In 2009, the employment-population ratio — the proportion of the population that is employed — was 19.2 percent for persons with a disability. Among those with no disability, the ratio was much higher (64.5 percent). For all age groups, persons with a disability were much less likely to be employed than those with no disability. The latest unemployment rate of persons with a disability is 14.5 percent. These statistics were obtained from the Current Population Survey, a monthly survey that provides statistics on employment and unemployment in the United States.

"August 23, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20100823,"US Department of Labors OSHA cites E.N. Range Inc. in Miami, Fla., more than $2 million for exposing workers to lead and other hazards","FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration has issued citations to E.N. Range Inc. in Miami, Fla., alleging the company knowingly neglected to protect employees who clean gun ranges from serious overexposure to lead. It also provided, without medical supervision, non-FDA-approved treatments for lead exposure. The company was cited for more than 50 violations of the lead standard and others, with total proposed penalties of $2,099,600. ""This company was well aware of what it needed to do to protect its workers from a well known hazard. It not only failed to provide that protection, it misled employees – most of whom had limited knowledge of English – into believing that it was providing them with appropriate medical treatment,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""Such a blatant disregard for the health of workers will not be tolerated under this administration."" E.N. Range has been cited for 42 willful and serious violations of the lead standard with proposed penalties of $1,884,000. OSHA's lead standard requires employers to protect their workers from lead exposure which can cause many serious health issues including brain damage, paralysis, kidney disease, and even death. OSHA's lead standard also addresses the use of chelating agents, which are medicines intended to reduce blood levels that can have significant adverse side effects. The standard prohibits the use of these agents prophylactically, and permits their therapeutic use only under the supervision of a physician in an appropriate clinical setting. Willful citations were issued alleging that E.N. Range violated this provision by giving its workers non-FDA-approved chelating agents without medical supervision. ""This is an egregious situation where the employer deliberately refused to provide the necessary protections to keep workers safe from overexposure to lead,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for OSHA Dr. David Michaels. ""The company even knew its workers suffered from lead poisoning, yet avoided proper medical attention in favor of providing an unapproved and potentially unsafe treatment."" The citations allege that E.N. Range did not use engineering controls to prevent overexposure to lead, perform air sampling to determine the extent of its workers' exposure, provide showers for workers who had been exposed to lead, or provide blood testing to exposed workers every six months, all of which are required by the lead standard. The company was also found in violation of the respiratory protection standard for failing to provide medical evaluations and fit testing for respirators. Additionally, the company is being cited for failing to abate a previously-cited violation discovered during an inspection in February 2009. That failure-to-abate notice charges that the employer had neglected to implement a job rotation schedule to reduce lead exposures. The company is also being cited for additional serious violations, including a spliced electrical cable and failure to ensure the blades of a box fan were adequately guarded. A willful violation is one committed with plain indifference to or intentional disregard for employees' safety and health. A serious citation is issued when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known. Two other-than-serious violations have been issued with no penalty for failing to label bags used to dispose of contaminated clothing. The company has 15 business days from receipt of the citations and proposed penalties to comply, request a conference with OSHA's area director or contest the findings before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. The site was inspected by staff from OSHA's Fort Lauderdale Area Office, 1000 S. Pine Island Road, Suite 100, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33324; telephone 954-424-0242.

"August 23, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20100823-0,US Labor Departments OSHA cites SeaWorld of Florida following animal trainers death,"ORLANDO, Fla. The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration has cited SeaWorld of Florida LLC for three safety violations, including one classified as willful, following the death of an animal trainer in February. The total penalty is $75,000. ""SeaWorld recognized the inherent risk of allowing trainers to interact with potentially dangerous animals,"" said Cindy Coe, OSHA's regional administrator in Atlanta, Ga. ""Nonetheless, it required its employees to work within the pool walls, on ledges and on shelves where they were subject to dangerous behavior by the animals."" On Feb. 24, a six-ton killer whale grabbed a trainer and pulled her under the water during what SeaWorld describes as a ""relationship session,"" which was also observed by park guests. Video footage shows the killer whale repeatedly striking and thrashing the trainer, and pulling her under water even as she attempted to escape. The autopsy report describes the cause of death as drowning and traumatic injuries. OSHA's investigation revealed that this animal was one of three killer whales involved in the death of an animal trainer in 1991 at Sea Land of the Pacific in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. SeaWorld had forbidden trainers from swimming with this whale because of his dangerous past behavior, but allowed trainers to interact with the whale, including touching him, while the trainers were lying on the pool edge in shallow water. In addition to the history with this whale, the OSHA investigation revealed that SeaWorld trainers had an extensive history of unexpected and potentially dangerous incidents involving killer whales at its various facilities, including its location in Orlando. Despite this record, management failed to make meaningful changes to improve the safety of the work environment for its employees. ""All employers are obligated to assess potential risks to the safety and health of their employees and take actions to mitigate those risks,"" said Les Grove, OSHA's area director in Tampa, Fla. ""In facilities that house wild animals, employers need to assess the animals under their care and to minimize human-animal interaction if there is no safe way to reliably predict animal behavior under all conditions."" OSHA has issued one willful citation to SeaWorld for exposing its employees to struck-by and drowning hazards when interacting with killer whales. The agency defines a willful violation as one committed with plain indifference to or intentional disregard for employee safety and health. A serious citation is being issued for exposing employees to a fall hazard by failing to install a stairway railing system on the front side, left bridge of the ""Believe"" stage in Shamu Stadium. OSHA issues a serious citation when death or serious physical harm is likely to result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known. One other-than-serious violation has been issued for failing to equip outdoor electrical receptacles in Shamu Stadium with weatherproof enclosures. An other-than-serious violation is described as a situation that relates to job safety and health that would not likely cause death or serious physical harm. The company has 15 business days from receipt of the citations to comply, request an informal conference with OSHA's area director in Tampa or contest the citations and penalties before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.

"August 19, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20100819,"U.S. Labor Department sues corporate officers of defunct West Chester, Pennsylvania, company to protect pension plan participants","West Chester, Pennsylvania — The U.S. Department of Labor has sued defunct Reneuxit Inc. of West Chester, Mark D. Dampman and Wayne K. Hall for making improper loans and transfers from the company’s pension plan in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Dampman is a former corporate officer and trustee of the pension plan and Hall is the current plan trustee and was a corporate officer until the company ceased operations in January 2007. The suit alleges that from February 15 through June 26, 2006, Dampman illegally transferred funds from the plan in the form of loans to himself and an employee, despite the fact that plan documents specifically prohibited loans to participants. Illegal transfers also were made to Dampman’s personal bank accounts and other company accounts. The suit further alleges that when Hall became aware of the transfers, he took no action to restore the funds to the plan. “The defendants clearly abused their authority as plan trustees by showing no regard for the participants they were legally obligated to protect,” said Mabel Capolongo, regional administrator of the Labor Department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. “When plan fiduciaries fall short of this obligation, they will be held accountable.” Filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, the suit seeks to restore to the plan all losses and opportunity costs, remove the defendants as plan fiduciaries, appoint an independent fiduciary to administer the plan and permanently enjoin Dampman, Hall and Reneuxit Inc. from serving directly or indirectly as fiduciaries to any employee benefit plan covered by ERISA. The department’s legal action resulted from an investigation by EBSA’s Philadelphia Regional Office. Employers and workers can contact that office at 215.861.5300 or toll-free at 866.444.3272 for help with problems relating to private sector pension and health plans. In fiscal year 2009, the department achieved monetary results of $1.3 billion in pension, 401(k), health and other benefits for millions of American workers and their families.

"August 18, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20100818,Statement from US Department of Labor warns employers along Gulf Coast against withholding of HAZWOPER certificates,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration has received numerous complaints from workers taking part in the Gulf Coast oil spill cleanup whose employers are refusing to provide them with a certificate following their completion of training under the Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response, or HAZWOPER, standard. OSHA interprets the standard as prohibiting covered employers from withholding written certificates from workers who have successfully completed such training. Commenting on the need to protect vulnerable workers and ensure a level playing field for employers who follow the rules, Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health Dr. David Michaels today issued the following statement: ""It has come to OSHA's attention during the Gulf Coast oil spill cleanup that some employers performing post-emergency cleanup operations are refusing to provide workers with written certificates attesting successful completion of HAZWOPER training. Allegedly, employers use this practice to prevent workers from leaving their employ. ""There is no basis in the HAZWOPER standard for an argument that employers do not need to provide written certification promptly upon the completion of training. The requirement to provide written certification implies a requirement to provide it with reasonable promptness. ""OSHA is processing complaints related to the withholding of training certificates, and already has referred some matters to the Office of the Inspector General within the Department of Labor for examination as possible consumer fraud."""
"August 18, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/vets/vets20100818,"US Labor Department announces nearly $900,000 for VETS National Technical Assistance Center","WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor today announced two grants totaling $849,890 to fund the Veterans Employment and Training Service National Technical Assistance Center. The grants are being awarded under the Labor Department s Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program. As our grantees forge ahead in the effort to help the nation s homeless veterans, it is important the work be done in the most efficient and effective manner, said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. These grants will help provide invaluable tools and resources to our local partners under the Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program. These organizations are providing essential services to women and men who have served in America s armed forces, and we are committed to ensuring their success. These HVRP grants include two cooperative agreements that will maintain and develop the HVRP National Technical Assistance Center. The center provides technical assistance to current grantees, potential applicants and the public; gathers grantee best practices; conducts employment-related research on homeless veterans; conducts regional grantee training sessions and self-employment boot camps; and performs outreach to the employer community to increase job opportunities for veterans. The National Coalition of Homeless Veterans in Washington, D.C., and the Burton Blatt Institute at the University of Syracuse in New York each received grants aimed at stimulating and improving the delivery system of services provided under existing HVRP grants, including grants to serve women veterans, veterans with families and incarcerated veterans. Grantees under the HVRP program network coordinate their efforts with various local, state and federal social service providers.

"August 18, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20100818,Statement of US Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis on 90th anniversary of Constitutions 19th Amendment granting women right to vote,"WASHINGTON U.S. Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis today issued the following statement on the 90th anniversary of the 19th Amendment's ratification: ""Today marks the 90th anniversary of a milestone in our country's history. After decades of fighting for equality, suffragists achieved a moral and legal victory in attaining the right of women to vote. ""Because of that victory, our nation was able to accomplish progress for women in many other areas, including major steps toward equality in employment. In 1963, the Equal Pay Act was signed, forbidding men to be paid more than women for the same job. A year later, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act was passed, prohibiting discrimination in employment on the basis of sex or race, along with other bases. ""Women are now present in virtually every occupation and currently fill many of the country's top leadership jobs, including three Supreme Court justices, four Cabinet positions and speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, among others. ""Although we have made great progress over the past nine decades, we still have a long way to go when it comes to equality for women in the workplace. Many families depend solely on women's paychecks; however, women still hold a majority of low-wage jobs. And the pay gap still exists despite the fact that more women are working than ever before. ""The Department of Labor is focused on promoting equal pay, work-life balance, paid leave and employment opportunities for all women. Without these measures, true equality cannot be realized. ""I believe that we can all agree work is about more than a paycheck. Work is about dignity and respect, just like the universal right to vote. Our common prosperity will be advanced by allowing all people, men and women, to reach their full potential. And that's what the Labor Department is working toward every single day."""

"August 17, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20100817,"MSHA issues Big Laurel Mining Corp. more than $542,000 in violations","Southwestern Virginia coal mine fined in 2009 mining fatality ARLINGTON, Va. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration today announced $542,400 in proposed penalties against Big Laurel Mining Corp. The mining operation, located in Wise County, Va., was cited for five contributory violations in the August 2009 death of an electrician/repairman who was fatally injured when a portion of mine rib collapsed upon him. Two of the violations have been assessed as flagrant. On Aug. 20, 2009, the 58-year-old miner with 33 years experience was preparing to set timbers in an entryway when a rock measuring 26 feet long, 2.5 feet wide and 5 feet high toppled, and struck and crushed him. One day earlier, a hazardous condition noting excessive (wide) entry width in the No. 4 Entry had been logged in the pre-shift book, but the operator failed to correct the condition and made no notations in the evening on-shift and pre-shift reports. A combination of factors occurred prior to the accident. MSHA investigators determined that the mine operator 1) did not properly utilize a sightline or other directional control to maintain the projected direction of mining, 2) failed to follow the approved roof control plan, 3) failed to perform adequate pre-shift and on-shift examinations and 4) failed to adequately support the rib. The first two determinations were flagged as flagrant violations, which can carry fines up to $220,000 each. ""The importance of pre-shift and on-shift examinations can never be overstated,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""Had the adverse conditions been detected and logged into the exam books properly, and had management overseen the detection and correction of those hazardous conditions, this tragedy could have been avoided."" The complaint was filed under section 105(c) of the Mine Act, a provision that prohibits a mine operator from retaliating against a miner for exercising protected rights, including making safety complaints. The purpose of the protection is to encourage miners ""to play an active part in the enforcement of the Mine Act"" recognizing that ""if miners are to be encouraged to be active in matters of safety and health, they must be protected against any possible discrimination which they might suffer as a result of their participation."""

The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration has proposed penalties of $374,500 against Cooperative Plus Inc., a farmer-owned cooperative, for federal workplace safety violations at its Whitewater and Genoa City, Wis., sites. These penalties follow $721,000 in penalties issued earlier this month after a worker was seriously injured from being engulfed by soybeans at the cooperative's Burlington, Wis., facility in February. ""This continued non-compliance with long established safety standards for working in grain handling operations by Cooperative Plus Inc. shows a complete disregard for worker safety,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for OSHA Dr. David Michaels. ""All workers have the right to work in a safe environment, and the Labor Department will use all legal means necessary to ensure companies comply with established safety requirements."" Based on its investigation of the Cooperative Plus facility in Whitewater, OSHA has fined the company $210,000 for three alleged willful violations. The company failed to test the atmosphere before entry and to have an employee entering wear a safety harness and lifeline. It also failed to post an employee to observe the entry, and to turn off and lock out power to the auger before workers entered the grain bins. The Genoa City facility has received a proposed $70,000 penalty for one alleged willful violation, again for failing to shut down and lock out power to the grain bin augers before workers entered the bins. In addition to the willful citations, the company has received $35,500 in proposed penalties for seven alleged serious violations at the Whitewater facility. The citations allege, among other violations, that the company lacked an emergency action plan and failed to train workers in the emergency use of respirators and on safe grain handling hazards. It also failed to test the oxygen levels in pits prior to entry or to maintain air-monitoring equipment for confined space entries. The company also has received a $59,000 proposed penalty for 11 alleged serious violations found at Genoa City. Violations address failures to implement confined space procedures while working in fertilizer tanks; to test the air quality before workers entered fertilizer tanks; to meet requirements for an emergency action plan; to train workers on grain handling hazards annually; and to equip employees with body harnesses and lifelines while working in grain bins. OSHA recently sent letters to other grain storage companies warning them of their responsibility to comply with grain-handling and confined space entry standards. The company has 15 business days from receipt of its citations and proposed penalties to comply with or contest OSHA's findings before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. To report workplace accidents, fatalities or situations posing imminent danger to workers, call OSHA's toll-free hotline at 800-321-6742. Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. OSHA's role is to assure these conditions for America's working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education and assistance.

"August 17, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/owcp/owcp20100817,US Department of Labor proposes rule on workers who repair recreational vessels,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Labor today announced a notice of proposed rulemaking implementing changes in the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act as mandated by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Previously, the Longshore Act excluded several specific groups of workers from coverage when those workers were subject to a state workers' compensation program. Workers repairing recreational vessels fewer than 65 feet in length were one of the excluded groups, but workers who repaired recreational vessels 65 feet or longer were protected by the Longshore Act. Language in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 changed this exclusion so that the Longshore Act now excludes all workers who repair recreational vessels or dismantle them for repair, regardless of the length of the vessel on which they work. The proposed regulation defines terms such as ""recreational vessel"" and addresses whether workers who perform tasks in addition to those within the excluded categories are otherwise covered under the Longshore Act. Written comments regarding the proposed regulation can be submitted to the Labor Department until Oct. 18, 2010.

"August 17, 2010",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20100817,US Labor Department obtains nearly $1 million in back wages and interest for 135 H-1B workers of Smartsoft International,"ATLANTA  Smartsoft International Inc., a computer consulting company based in Suwanee, Ga., has agreed to pay nearly $1 million in back wages and interest to 135 nonimmigrant workers temporarily employed by the company under the H-1B visa program. The U.S. Department of Labor's Office of the Solicitor reached this agreement following a determination by the department's Wage and Hour Division that the company violated the H-1B program's rules. Smartsoft International also has U.S. offices in Sunnyvale, Calif., and North Brunswick, N.J. ""Workers deserve to receive the full wages for which they have worked so hard. That is not just a matter of decency and common sense, it's the law,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""The resolution of this case underscores the Labor Department's commitment to enforcing our nation's employment laws, including those designed to protect H-1B program participants."" A Wage and Hour Division investigator determined that some employees were not paid any wages at the beginning of their employment, were paid on a part-time basis despite being hired under a full-time employment agreement, and were paid less than the prevailing wage applicable to the geographic locations where they performed their work. The company contested the Wage and Hour Division's conclusions and requested a formal hearing with the Labor Department's Office of Administrative Law Judges. As part of this agreement, the company will drop any further challenge. The H-1B program allows employers to hire nonimmigrant workers in specialty occupations. The law establishes certain standards in order to protect similarly employed U.S. workers from being adversely affected by the employment of the nonimmigrant workers, as well as to protect the H-1B nonimmigrant workers. Employers must attest to the Labor Department that they will pay wages to the H-1B nonimmigrant workers that are at least equal to the actual wages paid to other workers with similar experience and qualifications for the job in question, or the prevailing wage for the occupation in the area of intended employment, whichever is greater. The department's Office of the Solicitor provided legal support to the Wage and Hour Division in this dispute.
