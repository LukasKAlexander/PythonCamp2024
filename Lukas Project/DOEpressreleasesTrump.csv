During a STEM education briefing, the Department reported strong progress in implementing the Administration's five-year STEM education strategy, including building on more than $819 million in STEM investments during fiscal years 2018 and 2019. ""This Administration's strategic focus on STEM education will help expose America's students to new and exciting learning environments that will prepare them for in-demand, high-paying careers,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. ""I'm grateful to President Trump for making STEM education a priority and for putting America's students and her workforce first."" These STEM education investments deliver on President Trump's commitment to help expand opportunities in high-demand STEM careers and achieve the overall vision and goals of the five-year federal STEM education strategic plan, titled Charting A Course For Success: America's Strategy for STEM Education . Of the FY 2020 STEM education investments, the Department awarded $141 million in new grants and $437 million to continue existing projects that are making substantial progress toward their goals.

Approximately $156 million supported projects with a focus on computer science. Several of the STEM investments support the Administration's Opportunity Zones Initiative , which fosters economic development and job creation in economically distressed communities. Investments made in FY 2020 include: $3.6 million for the Alaska Native Education Equity Program $300,000 for Braille training (rehabilitation services demonstrations and training) $5.1 million for the College Assistance Migrant Program (CAMP) $5 million for the Comprehensive Centers Program $124.7 million for Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs (Partnership Grants) (GEAR-UP) $23 million for Graduate Assistance in Areas of National Need $25 million for Innovative Approaches to Literacy $5.7 million for the Jacob K.

The Department has also supported STEM education beyond grant-making, through partnerships and innovations including: FY 2018 – Partnership with the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum to launch the ""She Can"" Summer Camp which provides middle schoolers from low-income families with hands-on STEM experiences, FY 2019 – Updates to the College Scorecard to help students and parents make more informed and personalized decisions about higher education options, including STEM, and FY 2020 – Creation of the inaugural Presidential Cybersecurity Education Award to elevate and recognize America's top cybersecurity K-12 educators.

Sadly, today’s results confirm America’s schools continue to fall far short, and continue to fail too many kids, especially the most disadvantaged. Being a high school graduate should mean something. But when 40% of these graduates are 'below basic' in math, and 30% are 'below basic' in reading, it’s hard to argue the education system is preparing them for what comes next. ""It’s particularly troubling to see the results for our lowest performing and most disadvantaged students getting worse. Education funding flows most heavily to these students’ schools, but these data make clear money to schools alone will not fix the problem. It’s a problem of approach. ""This Report Card should light a fire under America’s education leaders to pivot and try something new to avert another lost generation. Legislators of both parties should stop making excuses and start working with their governors and the White House right now to pass meaningful reforms that empower students and parents to take control of their education and their future. ""We must start to act like our national security hinges on fixing this, because it does. We must start to act like our economic growth hinges on fixing this, because it does. We must start to act like our very future hinges on solving this now, because it unquestionably does."""
