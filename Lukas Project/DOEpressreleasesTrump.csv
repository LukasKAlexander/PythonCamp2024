During a STEM education briefing, the Department reported strong progress in implementing the Administration's five-year STEM education strategy, including building on more than $819 million in STEM investments during fiscal years 2018 and 2019. ""This Administration's strategic focus on STEM education will help expose America's students to new and exciting learning environments that will prepare them for in-demand, high-paying careers,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. ""I'm grateful to President Trump for making STEM education a priority and for putting America's students and her workforce first."" These STEM education investments deliver on President Trump's commitment to help expand opportunities in high-demand STEM careers and achieve the overall vision and goals of the five-year federal STEM education strategic plan, titled Charting A Course For Success: America's Strategy for STEM Education . Of the FY 2020 STEM education investments, the Department awarded $141 million in new grants and $437 million to continue existing projects that are making substantial progress toward their goals. For example, Department funds will be used to prepare the STEM teacher corps for careers in the classroom, expand opportunities for low-income students to succeed in postsecondary education , and expand research and training opportunities on the improvement of students' STEM knowledge and skills , including learners with or at risk of disabilities . Approximately $156 million supported projects with a focus on computer science. Several of the STEM investments support the Administration's Opportunity Zones Initiative , which fosters economic development and job creation in economically distressed communities. Investments made in FY 2020 include: $3.6 million for the Alaska Native Education Equity Program $300,000 for Braille training (rehabilitation services demonstrations and training) $5.1 million for the College Assistance Migrant Program (CAMP) $5 million for the Comprehensive Centers Program $124.7 million for Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs (Partnership Grants) (GEAR-UP) $23 million for Graduate Assistance in Areas of National Need $25 million for Innovative Approaches to Literacy $5.7 million for the Jacob K. Javits Gifted and Talented Students Education Program $900,000 for Migrant Education Consortium Incentive Grants (CIG) $29 million for the Native Hawaiian Education Program $12.6 million for the Minority Science and Engineering Improvement Program (MSEIP) $1.4 million for the Perkins Innovation & Modernization Grant Program $300,000 for Strengthening Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander Serving Institutions (AANAPISI) $2.3 million for Strengthening Native American Nontribal Serving Institutions (NASNTI) $1.5 million to provide special education programs in educational technology, media, and materials for students with disabilities via a cooperative agreement with the Center on Early STEM Learning for Young Children $9.3 million to provide special education programs educational technology, media, and materials for individuals with disabilities via Stepping Up $151.2 million for Federal TRIO Programs $73.7 million for Supporting Effective Educator Development (SEED) $49.4 million for the Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) $28.2 million for Education Research Grants Programs $1.5 million for the Fulbright-Hays Doctoral Dissertation Research Abroad Program $4.3 million for the Small Business Innovation and Research (SBIR) Program $11.1 million for the Special Education Research Grants Program $6.3 million for Research Training in the Education Sciences $2.6 million for Research Training in Special Education The investments announced today explicitly address STEM and do not include other Department funds that schools and institutions of higher education (IHEs) can use to support STEM education, such as formula funding provided through the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) and Perkins V, federal student aid, or the CARES Act's Education Stabilization Fund. The Department has also supported STEM education beyond grant-making, through partnerships and innovations including: FY 2018 – Partnership with the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum to launch the ""She Can"" Summer Camp which provides middle schoolers from low-income families with hands-on STEM experiences, FY 2019 – Updates to the College Scorecard to help students and parents make more informed and personalized decisions about higher education options, including STEM, and FY 2020 – Creation of the inaugural Presidential Cybersecurity Education Award to elevate and recognize America's top cybersecurity K-12 educators.

Sadly, today’s results confirm America’s schools continue to fall far short, and continue to fail too many kids, especially the most disadvantaged. Being a high school graduate should mean something. But when 40% of these graduates are 'below basic' in math, and 30% are 'below basic' in reading, it’s hard to argue the education system is preparing them for what comes next. ""It’s particularly troubling to see the results for our lowest performing and most disadvantaged students getting worse. Education funding flows most heavily to these students’ schools, but these data make clear money to schools alone will not fix the problem. It’s a problem of approach. ""This Report Card should light a fire under America’s education leaders to pivot and try something new to avert another lost generation. Legislators of both parties should stop making excuses and start working with their governors and the White House right now to pass meaningful reforms that empower students and parents to take control of their education and their future. ""We must start to act like our national security hinges on fixing this, because it does. We must start to act like our economic growth hinges on fixing this, because it does. We must start to act like our very future hinges on solving this now, because it unquestionably does."""

""As technology continues to iterate and benefit every part of our lives, all students need more opportunities to leverage the potential of technology in education,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. ""We hope families can use the information we release today as many of them are relying on technology more so than ever before and are navigating learning from home."" Digital learning can help families and educators meet the specific needs of individual students, understand a child's progress, and connect families and students with resources in their school community and beyond. As an increasing number of school systems implement digital learning both inside and outside of the traditional classroom, this guide demystifies digital learning for parents and empowers them to be effective advocates for high-quality digital learning. The Parent and Family Digital Learning Guide includes guidance and best practices for caregivers around topics including: 1. How to leverage flexibilities and innovations technology and digital tools provide, such as accessibility options, to meet the unique needs of every learner — including students with disabilities and English language learners. 2. Simple steps parents can take to keep their children safe online and foster safe online behavior, such as accessing security features on a child's device, keeping track of log-in information, and keeping children safe while videoconferencing. The guide also discusses the importance of digital citizenship and offers parents resources to help their child navigate online bullying or encounters with troubling content. 3. How a competency-based learning approach, which measures a student's knowledge of a subject rather than time spent on the subject, can harness technology for the benefit of students. Digital resources like online assessments, periodic check-ins, and more can update parents on their child's learning progress, and they can provide instructional flexibility in the event of a school disruption. 4. Easy-to-understand primers on major federal laws governing student privacy and safety, such as FERPA, IDEA, and COPPA. The Parent and Family Digital Learning Guide was informed by the feedback and contributions of digital learning experts representing researchers, parents, educators, and school leaders, as well as Digital Promise and Learning Heroes. This publication is the first in a series that will ultimately provide digital learning knowledge and resources to educators and school leaders in addition to parents and students. The guide can be viewed here ."

Initiated in February 2020, the FWS Experimental Sites at 190 institutions have incentivized student work opportunities that provide not only a paycheck, but meaningful skills training that aligns with students’ future career goals. This funding will be used both to supplement FWS wages and to create and grow Job Location and Development (JLD) programs. JLD programs provide critical support for institutions as they seek out employer partners, help students find jobs, and oversee the quality of the work opportunities. JLD programs serve FWS and non-FWS students alike. “The expansion of earn-and-learn sites incentivizes employers and institutions to work together for the benefit of students. Students will earn much more than a paycheck – they will gain the skills and experiences needed to succeed in any career,” said Secretary DeVos. “That’s why we’re directing additional funds for students who need them the most. Breaking down silos between the classroom and the workplace is the right thing to do for students and for our economy.” Because this experiment makes clear that FWS students may work more than 10 hours per week, low-income students at participating institutions will no longer need to decline their FWS award so that they can seek a job that provides more hours. Additionally, the FWS Experimental Sites may pay students for the work they do, such as student teaching, externships, and clinical rotations, even if that work is a required part of their academic program. Low-income students at participating institutions are no longer forced to choose between completing their program’s requirements or earning wages. The new FWS Experiment supplemental allocation formula directs funding to where it is needed most: institutions enrolling students from low-income backgrounds. These students will disproportionately benefit from placement in off-campus jobs that allow them to meet their earning needs while gaining a foothold in their future career. The prior supplemental allocation formula, set by Congress in the Higher Education Act, included a base guarantee and a fair share formula, neither of which emphasized the needs of low-income students at under-resourced institutions. The new formula accounts for the institution’s prior year FWS expenditures and provides more funding to institutions based on the number of Pell Grant recipients it serves.

Section 117 of the Higher Education Act requires institutions of higher education to transparently report foreign gifts and contracts, yet over the course of the last year, the Department has uncovered billions in unreported financial ties. “The threat of improper foreign influence in higher education is real. Our action today ensures that America’s students, educators, and taxpayers can follow the money,” said Secretary DeVos. “Transparency in foreign funding of higher education is not just something I think is a good thing; it’s the law. For too long, enforcement of that law was lax, but not anymore.” After four decades of pervasive noncompliance by colleges and universities, this landmark report produced by the Office of the General Counsel empowers American taxpayers with the transparency they deserve about the relationships between taxpayer-supported institutions and foreign actors, who may not have the best interests of students at heart. The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations described foreign spending on U.S. schools as “a black hole” because colleges and universities “routinely” fail to comply with the law, and reported foreign money can come with strings attached that might compromise academic freedom. Major findings of the report include: Two universities failed to accurately account for foreign funding of their campuses in Doha,Qatar, which are funded in part by the Qatari government. The Qatari Foundation exerted its financial influence to stifle free speech. Huawei, the Chinese technology giant supported by the Chinese Communist Party, had financial ties to nearly all the investigated institutions. Huawei targets its higher education funding to issues important to national security such as nuclear science, robotics, and online cloud services. Two Chinese companies are working with one U.S. university on a research project involving crowd surveillance and predictive behavior technology, which the Chinese government could potentially harness for nefarious purposes. A large donation by Prince Alwaleed bin Talal to Georgetown University empowered the Saudis to push a particular ideologically-driven narrative through the teaching and learning done on specific topics relevant to the Middle East. One university accepted a $25,000 sponsorship from Kaspersky Government Security Solutions, a cybersecurity company with suspected ties to the Russian government, to host a cybersecurity conference. In June, the Secretary unveiled a new online portal to make it easier for schools to report foreign gifts and contracts valued at more than $250,000. That reporting portal has recorded more than 7,000 transactions that total approximately $3.8 billion. Approximately 60 of the institutions who have filed through this portal so far had not submitted any reports between 1986 and June 2020. Their disclosures alone totaled more than $350 million during the July 31, 2020 reporting period. A copy of the full report can be accessed here ."

This data, which are self-reported by 17,604 public school districts and 97,632 public schools and educational programs, have been collected and published biennially by OCR since 1968. The CRDC is a universal collection of data related to OCR’s civil rights enforcement responsibilities at Pre-K through 12th grade levels, including charter schools, magnet schools or programs, alternative schools, schools serving students with disabilities, and long-term secure juvenile justice facilities. The 2017-18 CRDC covers a broad array of topics and requires school districts and their schools to collect and input as many as 1,700 data points. Among the data collected, parents and students can find information on enrollment, various advanced placement and math courses offered, and gifted and talented programs, as well as data on school characteristics. “Protecting all students’ civil rights is at the core of OCR’s mission, and in order to meet that challenge, we need reliable, accurate data and a true partnership with state education agencies and school districts,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. “I’m proud of this administration’s commitment to working with schools and local districts to ensure students’ civil rights are protected, whether it be through our new Outreach, Prevention, Education and Non-discrimination (OPEN) Center, or the significant steps we’ve taken to ensure CRDC data quality, including our partnership with the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). While self-reported data poses challenges, the quality assurance measures we have put into place help make this data more reliable than ever before.” As a result of OCR’s important partnership with NCES, announced in August 2019 , the 2017-18 CRDC contains improved data quality in several categories. The 2017-18 CRDC was improved over past collections by addressing statistical anomalies and increasing post-collection outreach in order to give school districts an opportunity to submit amended, accurate data. Data quality reviews and technical enhancements included the following: Conducting greater outreach to school districts with potentially anomalous restraint and seclusion data submissions; and Allocating additional technical support resources, clarifying proper understanding of reporting requirements, and working with school districts to ensure detailed written corrective plans were put into place when data was incomplete. “The CRDC is an important aspect of OCR’s overall strategy for enforcing civil rights in the nation’s public schools and is an important tool in our work to ensure that every child has the opportunity to learn in an environment that is free from discrimination,” said Kimberly M. Richey, acting assistant secretary for civil rights. “For the last three years, OCR has prioritized improving data validity and reliability so that the CRDC can be even more effective. Our increased data quality and improved collection efforts will benefit stakeholders, schools, families, and those who are committed to eliminating roadblocks to a quality education for all students.” The CRDC website includes many useful tools, including tables and charts, that display a district’s or school’s data about key issues for the current CRDC and/or multiple prior collections at the same time. This year, the Department modernized the website’s user interface and infrastructure, making it look and function better than ever before. The website has an updated look, a Quick Search function, and is faster. Now, all content will be accurately displayed on all types of devices (e.g., phones, tablets, and desktops). In addition, OCR released two issue briefs on topics about which Secretary DeVos has raised concerns: the use of restraint and seclusion on students with disabilities and sexual violence in K-12 schools: https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/restraint-and-seclusion.pdf and https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/sexual-violence.pdf .

This year’s slate includes four new members and one re-appointed member. Former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour has been reappointed as chair for a second year. The appointees will help define and objectively measure student performance in nearly a dozen academic subjects by setting policy for the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), also known as The Nation’s Report Card. NAEP provides objective information on student performance in various subjects and for different student groups and reports on student achievement across the nation, in states, and in large urban districts. The 26-member Governing Board is responsible for deciding which subjects NAEP assesses, determining the assessments’ content, setting achievement levels that describe student performance, and pursuing new ways to make NAEP results useful and meaningful to the public. “It’s a privilege to appoint this distinguished group of leaders to the National Assessment Governing Board,” said Secretary DeVos. “Because so many students had their educations disrupted by the pandemic, measuring their progress is more critical than ever as we continue our work to ensure every student is learning and growing. The Nation’s Report Card has told a grim story the past several years, and we must remain vigilant against student achievement sliding even further backward.” The appointees’ terms officially began on Oct. 1, 2020, and will end on Sept. 30, 2024. The new Governing Board appointees are: Suzanne Lane, testing and measurement expert: Lane has been a faculty member in the research methodology program at the University of Pittsburgh’s School of Education since 1986.

Tim Scott and members of the White House Domestic Policy Council, participated in a call with African American leaders this week on the importance of education freedom and how the ""School Choice Now Act"" could expand educational options and opportunities for African American students. ""African Americans, and all Americans, need more opportunities to grow, to develop, and to prosper, and that all starts with a great education. President Trump and I are fighting every day for more options for every student and every family across America,"" Secretary DeVos told participants. ""Under the President's leadership, we've lit a prairie fire across America for parental school choice. Countless surveys show that more families today support parental choice than ever before. Notably, a very recent RealClear Opinion survey found that 73% of African American families want their education dollars to follow their children to wherever they go to learn. Three out of four families with children in public schools want the same thing."" Sen. Tim Scott thanked Secretary DeVos for her leadership on school choice initiatives and for her support of the ""School Choice Now Act"" which was included in the most recent Senate COVID-19 relief package. Sen. Scott called the issue of school choice ""personal,"" noting that he grew up in a single-parent home below the poverty line with limited access to a quality education. ""The commitment to education is not a political one,"" Sen. Scott said. ""The commitment to education is to ensure that the American dream is alive even for the poorest Americans."" The call engaged a broad audience of African American community leaders and school choice advocates from across the country to discuss the importance of school choice in the African American community, especially for low income families. Below are highlights from speakers: Brooke Rollins, Assistant to the President and Acting Director of the Domestic Policy Council Brooke Rollins moderated the call and introduced Secretary DeVos after brief remarks highlighting the President's commitment to advancing school choice. ""This President will fight to his last breath for Americans, especially those who need it the most,"" Rollins said. ""Our forgotten children need school choice… Nothing is more important for the future of this country than a world class education."" Ja'Ron Smith, Deputy Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy and Deputy Director of the White House Office of American Innovation In his brief remarks, Deputy Assistant to the President Ja'Ron Smith thanked Secretary DeVos and Sen. Scott for their leadership on school choice, he noted, ""The White House has always been focused on a holistic approach to elevating communities. We know that school choice is a national issue but it really affects local communities."" John DeBerry Jr., state representative, Tennessee Tennessee state Rep. John DeBerry Jr., called school choice ""one of the most important civil rights issues of our time,"" while adding that ""education is key to equality."" ""I had parents call me every day in tears because their children are not getting the attention they need,"" Rep. DeBerry said. ""This should be a nonpartisan issue. What's at stake is the future of our nation, the future of our republic… We have to stop the schoolhouse-to-jailhouse pipeline that we see in so many of our communities."" Terris Todd, Executive Director of the White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for African Americans Terris Todd, Executive Director of the White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for African Americans, praised Secretary DeVos for being ""a staunch advocate for school choice,"" while adding, ""This is about students."" ""[Secretary DeVos] asks the question ‘What will most benefit students,'"" Todd said in brief remarks to the call. ""It is all about what's best for the students, for their needs. African Americans can agree that parents have that final decision of what's best for their child… This is what the majority of African Americans want.""

Recipients of the funding include three statewide charter school associations, five state educational agencies, and more than 10 nonprofit organizations. Today’s announcement will provide relief to the millions of American families currently stuck on long waiting lists hoping to attend a public charter school. “The coronavirus pandemic has made it clearer than ever before that students need the freedom to choose where, when and how they learn,” said Secretary DeVos. “All too many students, particularly the most vulnerable, have fallen further behind because the one-size-fits-all system couldn’t transition and adapt to meet their needs. A bright spot has been high-quality charter schools, many of which pivoted quickly and kept learning going. These grants will help to ensure these high-quality options are available to even more students in the future.” Awarded as part of the Charter Schools Program (CSP), which is authorized under Part C of Title IV of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), this funding will help create more seats in existing charter schools, launch new public charter schools, and guarantee charter schools have access to facilities. The CSP is an effective, bipartisan-supported program that has helped create tens of thousands of new public charter schools since it was first created in 1994. Over 90% of the funds will support projects located in certified Opportunity Zones. Currently, more than 70% of Opportunity Zones lack a public charter school option for families. Additionally, nearly $1 million in funding will support the creation and expansion of public charter schools to serve Native American communities, a longstanding priority for Secretary DeVos. The CSP includes multiple subprograms designed to meet the variety of public charter school needs, including creation, expansion, and access to facilities. Recipients of funding include: As with all the Department of Education’s discretionary grant competitions, applications for CSP funding were evaluated by a panel of independent peer reviewers, and only the highest-scoring applications received funding.

1-Oct-20,https://web.archive.org/web/20210108025343/https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/department-launches-2021-22-fafsa-cycle,Department Launches 2021-22 FAFSA Cycle,"WASHINGTON — Today, the U.S. Department of Education released the 2021–22 Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA®) form. This launch comes as the Department continues to provide information, tools, and resources to help students make informed decisions about their education options. Students and parents can easily complete the form via fafsa.gov on a desktop or mobile device, and this year, enhanced help topics provide even more guidance through the form. As a result of user feedback, many financial help topics on fafsa.gov now feature images of the forms with relevant line numbers visually highlighted to help applicants navigate the FAFSA form. Additionally, skip-logic functionality means applicants see only the questions that pertain to them. The Internal Revenue Service Data Retrieval Tool (IRS DRT) remains the fastest way for applicants to enter tax return information accurately on the FAFSA form. Beginning with the 2021–22 cycle, students and parents eligible to use the IRS DRT can securely transfer their answer to the Schedule 1 question into the FAFSA form. The Department provides other tools and resources designed to help students complete and submit the FAFSA form and make informed choices. The Annual Student Loan Acknowledgment provides links to College Scorecard , where students can estimate their post-completion starting salary based on the school they plan to attend and the program in which they will enroll. For borrowers with existing loans, the Annual Student Loan Acknowledgment outlines how much they owe and how much more they can borrow; grant recipients can see how much they have received and their remaining eligibility. Starting with the 2021–22 award year, the Annual Student Loan Acknowledgment will be required before borrowers can receive a financial aid disbursement. By the end of the year, the Department will launch an enhanced myStudentAid mobile app. The updated mobile app will have an entirely new look and feel, and additional features, including: A new dashboard that will provide customers with a personalized “home page,” where they can get an overview of their aid, view upcoming loan payments, and access relevant content, resources, and checklists; Aid summary that will allow users to view their detailed loan and grant aid information, aid overpayments, remaining Direct Loan and Pell Grant eligibility, and more; and Important alerts and account updates within the app’s Notification Center. This year, as a result of the FUTURE Act (a law that facilitates seamless data sharing between the Department and the IRS), the Department also expects to roll out a FAFSA simulator. The simulator will enable the Department to get feedback from students and families about ease of use and clarity of the FAFSA experience as it could exist when the FUTURE Act solution is fully implemented."

The Accessing Choices in Education (ACE) grants will help Native American communities set up a variety of education options and services, including additional course options, apprenticeships, tutoring and many other programs, from which parents or students can choose. “All too often, Native American students do not have access to high quality education options tailored to meet their needs, culture, heritage and ambitions,” said Secretary DeVos. “We developed the ACE grants to empower tribes to expand options for students, so they can then select the courses, services and on-the-job learning experiences that are the right fit for them. I am hopeful that by empowering tribes and the students they serve with more options for their education, we will see improved outcomes.” The ACE grant funds are critical to both rural and urban tribal communities who are often faced with limited choice options. Projects will support activities such as culturally relevant career exploration, including skills development, on-the-job training, hands-on learning with a focus on STEAM, counseling and mentorships, family engagement, and test preparation. An ACE proposal was required to include more than one education option from which parents and students may choose, including: advanced, remedial, or elective courses (including online); apprenticeships or training programs; concurrent or dual enrollment options; native language, history, or culture courses; supplemental counseling services; tuition; summer or afterschool education programs, and student transportation needed for those specific programs; and many other education-related services that the tribe determines are needed in its community. Additionally, grantees were required to set up a parent feedback process and respond to parent requests for specific services not already offered throughout project implementation. The ACE grants cover three years, with an additional two years of support available if the project is achieving objectives. Grantees may use up to the first year of the grant for planning needs, such as hiring personnel, securing service providers for options provided to students, and developing a method to collect parent feedback. The full list of awards will be available on the following website in the coming days: https://oese.ed.gov/offices/office-of-indian-education/demonstration-grants-for-indian-children/."

The three grant competitions announced earlier this year challenged education leaders to rethink teacher preparation, professional development, and compensation in order to treat teachers as valued professionals. ""Great teachers deserve to be treated as the professionals they are and to be compensated accordingly,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""All too often, though, they lack access to relevant professional development courses and are compensated on a step-scale ladder that treats them like cogs in a machine instead of as individuals with unique talents and interests. We've challenged today's awardees to rethink all of that, and they have risen to the challenge."" Today's grant awards are the latest in a series of actions the Secretary has taken to elevate the teaching profession and empower teachers to chart their own professional paths. Earlier this year, the Secretary announced a new federal funding priority to rethink professional development and empower teachers, through stipends or vouchers, to select and access professional development courses and opportunities that are relevant to their personal needs or career goals. This approach would empower teachers and replace the one-size-fits-all programming dictated to them by the state or local education agency. Many of the grants announced today will fund projects located in Qualified Opportunity Zones , bolstering workforce development and student achievement in underserved communities. Additional information on the three grant programs and the awards announced today can be found below: Teacher and School Leader Incentive (TSL) Program Under TSL, the Department made 13 awards totaling $63.7 million to support local education agencies in developing, enhancing, improving, and/or implementing human capital management systems (HCMS) that include performance-based teacher and/or principal compensation systems (PBCS). Each project is specifically designed to develop, enhance, improve, and/or implement an HCMS or PBCS, or both, in collaboration with teachers, administrators, other school leaders, and members of the public. Each of the funded projects was also designed to be concentrated in high-need schools and has the goal of increasing overall student achievement and closing the achievement gap between low- and high-performing students. Recipients include 11 public school districts and charter school networks from around the country, and two nonprofit organizations that support schools and districts in urban and rural communities nationwide. All 13 awards overlap with a Qualified Opportunity Zone, and nine are from organizations that have previously received a grant under this program.

The recipients will leverage the expertise and facilities available on college campuses to spur entrepreneurship and foster business development and innovation as America begins to recover from COVID-19-related disruptions to education. This funding was made available through the Education Stabilization Fund of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act , signed into law by President Donald J. Trump. Awardees include Alabama, Arkansas, California, Hawaii, Michigan, Nevada, New York, and Hampton University in partnership with the Commonwealth of Virginia. ""America's workers and entrepreneurs have been among the hardest hit by the pandemic, and this administration is committed to reigniting the entrepreneurial spirit and helping Americans reenter the workforce as the economy recovers,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""We created this grant competition because we saw the clear need to support lifelong learners who needed a boost to get back on their feet, and I was delighted to see so many states come forward with innovative initiatives and partnerships. By breaking down barriers between education and industry and supporting local entrepreneurs and small businesses, we can help workers thrive and get America's economic engine running at full speed again."" The grant awards will support states' efforts to assist in the development of new education and training opportunities; encourage the engagement of employers and industry sectors in providing high-quality education and training opportunities to improve workforce preparation, and enable innovators in local communities to benefit from access to faculty experts, state-of-the-art equipment, and shared facilities through the development or growth of small business incubators located at, or affiliated with, colleges and universities. Congress set aside 1% of the $30.75 billion allotted to the Education Stabilization Fund through the CARES Act for discretionary grants to fulfill unmet needs related to burdens caused by the pandemic. The Department of Education announced the Reimagine Workforce Preparation (RWP) grant competition in late spring 2020, inviting any state to apply. Specifically, it called for projects that: Expand educational opportunities through short-term, career pathways or sector-based education and training programs (absolute priority 1); or Support college sustainability and local entrepreneurship through small business incubators (absolute priority 2).

Their plan includes a two-tier approach with Level One focused on disconnected or dislocated workers with basic skills deficiencies and Level Two serving incumbent workers or dislocated workers who are prepared for direct employment . Hawaii – Through the University of Hawaii, the state plans to offer short-term education training opportunities through distance education ; create a statewide micro-credentials, badging, and licensing system that is public and interoperable ; expand Registered Apprenticeship Programs and Industry-Recognized Apprenticeship Programs ; and, develop articulated career pathways with college credit options for short-term education and apprenticeships. Michigan – The Michigan Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity - Workforce Development (LEO-WD) will launch the Michigan Learning & Education Advancement Program (MiLEAP) with the goal of serving 5,000 job seekers looking to earn credentials, gain skills for employment, return to work, and advance in a career pathway. MiLEAP will provide short- and mid-term customized education and training resulting in an industry credential through distance learning and hybrid modalities . The training will be employer-led, competency-based and coupled with work-based learning opportunities . Nevada – Through the Governor's Office of Workforce Innovation, Nevada is launching Project SANDI: Supporting and Advancing Nevada's Dislocated Individuals with the goal of modernizing Nevada's workforce system and expanding remote access to accelerated training for in-demand occupations. Their plan includes the development and deployment of a ""Skills Decoder"" that translates work experience into credentials, certificates, and degree programs , eventually automating the process for workforce systems and institutions of higher education. They also plan to invest in digital platforms (e.g. virtual and augmented reality) to remotely offer training for in-demand occupations. New York – The New York State Department of Labor intends to create, develop, implement, and take to scale short-term educational programs and training courses or programs, and/or career pathways programs, including those focused on facilitating and strengthening entrepreneurship and small business ownership. New York's approach will consist of four distinct, yet intertwining elements that will run concurrently to provide: (1) training in the field of digital transformation and exponential technologies for NYC residents; (2) scaling and increased implementation of statewide community college training initiatives ; (3) boot camps and workshops for new and established entrepreneurs; and (4) solicitations, including RFAs, to fund New York State businesses and other training providers in identifying and developing remote trainings, and/or transitioning trainings which already exist to remote, didactic formats. Virginia – Through Hampton University (HU), the Virginia Board of Workforce Development will establish the Virginia Workforce Innovation and Entrepreneurship Center (VWIEC), a statewide small business incubator project . Centering its operations on the HU campus and located within a designated Opportunity Zone , the VWIEC will expand the capability and capacity of Virginia's current and aspiring entrepreneurs to aid with economic recovery in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although headquartered in Hampton, it will serve clientele from across the state who have been unemployed, displaced, or have had their jobs have become obsolete by COVID-19. Applications were evaluated by a panel of independent peer reviewers, and the highest-scoring applications received funding. Given the nature of the national emergency, states with the highest coronavirus burden were prioritized. This grant competition is the latest in the Trump Administration's efforts to rethink higher education and support lifelong learning. Thanks to achieving historic consensus among higher education leaders, the Department has published several new regulations over the last year that will improve access to higher education for students, lower the cost, reduce regulatory burden for schools, and protect taxpayers who subsidize higher education. Additionally, the Department announced $180 million in awards through the Rethink K-12 Education Models Grant Program to support states' efforts to create new, innovative ways for students to continue learning in ways that meet their needs during the coronavirus pandemic. The Department continues to update www.ed.gov/coronavirus with information for students, parents, educators and local leaders about how to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Now it’s time to put those plans into motion, to be prepared to pivot as health realities on the ground change, and importantly, to do what’s right for students. I am inspired by the creative solutions some great school leaders, in concert with their communities, have come up with to serve their students.” The forum engaged a broad audience of K-12 education leaders from across the country as they consider creative ways to help students learn this fall, including state and district superintendents, private and charter school leaders, teachers and state and local school board members representing traditional public, charter, private, and tribal networks. Below are some of the highlights of successful strategies being utilized around the country to meet students’ learning needs this fall: ACCEL Academy, Mobile, Alabama ACCEL Academy developed three options for students to learn this fall: regular in-person instruction, a hybrid option with remote learning and a night school with small class sizes ranging between one and six students per class. “We are always testing new ideas to seek success. We felt that it was very important to give [students] the opportunity to return in person safely and also give them the opportunity to learn from home. The strategy has worked tremendously well, and we’ve been able to serve as many students as can fit in our building,” said Jeremiah Newell, headmaster of ACCEL Academy. Lake Mead Christian Academy, Henderson, Nevada Lake Mead Christian Academy focused on their early effort to build confidence in their community for returning to in-person instruction by assembling a parent task force, which includes an infectious disease specialist, and ensuring that the school stays in constant communication with parents to address their concerns. “We’ve been able to be open since August 27. Students are exceedingly grateful, and our students know that they are in a coveted position, being able to attend class in person. The confidence [in the community] came from communication: putting experts together and making sure that you are hearing parents’ opinions,” said Sue Blakeley, headmaster of Lake Mead Christian Academy. Homestead School, Glen Spey, New York Homestead School, a Montessori school, created informational videos to show parents and families what to expect when the school reopened, including measures the school is taking to clean the building each day. Additionally, the Montessori school took steps to ensure students remain socially distant by placing dots on the floor to indicate where students can establish workstations, increased their stock of materials so students do not share classroom resources, and experimented with outdoor learning. “Our goal is just to keep the learning happening and make it be outdoors as much as possible where kids are safest and honestly where they are happiest,” said Nisha Gupta, head of academic and financial affairs, middle school teacher at Homestead Montessori School. Gulfport School District, Mississippi The Gulfport School District in Mississippi has taken steps to ensure learning continues if a student or teacher tests positive or quarantines due to symptoms of COVID-19. The district prepares take-home backpacks with the week’s lessons so that students do not miss their class activities while learning continues from home. Additionally, the district has hired assistants that can help in the classroom in the event a teacher must teach remotely. “Our goal was to make sure that if a child or teacher was away from school for quarantine, they were able to still learn or instruct. We use a synchronous approach so that they feel like they are in the classroom. None of the 16 high school students who tested positive missed a day of school due to the option of remote learning,” said Glen East, superintendent of Gulfport School District. Kershaw County School District, South Carolina Kershaw County schools emphasized the need for community engagement to innovatively and successfully reopen schools. This includes partnerships aimed at advancing public health, effective communication, internet connectivity, and confidence in school operational procedures. “We started by organizing a taskforce of about 50 community members that we broke down by subcommittees as we began to brainstorm what our operational procedures were going to look like. The subcommittees consisted of a lot of local health care officials, parents, teachers, and school administrators. Any community will find that if you’re willing to look, you’ve got an immense amount of knowledge and resources at your fingertips. We wanted to leverage those individuals to help us build a plan – but also build support,” said Shane Robbins, superintendent of Kershaw County School District.

The recognition is based on a school's overall academic performance or progress in closing achievement gaps among student subgroups. ""Congratulations to this year's National Blue Ribbon School awardees,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""It's a privilege to recognize the extraordinary work you do to meet students' needs and prepare them for successful careers and meaningful lives."" The coveted National Blue Ribbon Schools award affirms the hard work of educators, families, and communities in creating safe and welcoming schools where students master challenging and engaging content. Now in its 38th year, the National Blue Ribbon Schools Program has bestowed almost 10,000 awards to more than 9,000 schools, with some schools winning multiple awards. Schools are eligible for nomination after five years. The Education Department recognizes all schools in one of two performance categories, based on all student scores, student subgroup scores, and graduation rates: Exemplary High Performing Schools – These are among their state's highest performing schools as measured by state assessments or nationally normed tests. Exemplary Achievement Gap Closing Schools – These are among their state's highest performing in closing achievement gaps between a school's student groups and all students. Up to 420 schools may be nominated each year. The U.S. Education Department invites National Blue Ribbon School nominations from the top education official in all states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the Department of Defense Education Activity, and the Bureau of Indian Education. Private schools are nominated by the Council for American Private Education (CAPE). The 2020 National Blue Ribbon Schools Awards Ceremony will be held virtually Nov. 12 and 13. While we regret not having the opportunity to celebrate in person, given the current situation regarding COVID-19, we will celebrate the 317 public and 50 non-public school honorees in the ways that we are able, and they will each receive their plaques and flags via mail.

These important educational opportunities help to ensure students seeking apprenticeships are prepared with the skills they need for success. “In our dynamic and changing economy, learning must be a life-long pursuit,” said Secretary DeVos. “Educational opportunities for adults should reflect this reality, but all too often, students, particularly adult learners, encounter barriers to changing careers and learning new skills. This pre-apprenticeship challenge gives local education leaders the opportunity and encouragement they need to rethink adult education to match this new reality and ensure students are prepared for success.” The Rethink Adult Ed Challenge, with prizes totaling $750,000, will help Adult Education and Family Literacy Act-funded adult education providers create innovative and high-quality pre-apprenticeship programs — in any industry, anywhere in the United States. Community colleges, correctional facilities, libraries, community-based organizations, and other eligible providers interested in entering the challenge should complete a Stage 1 submission by 11:59 p.m. ET on Nov. 25, 2020. The online submission seeks a preliminary design for a pre-apprenticeship program, including a description of the target learners, the adult education and literacy activities the program may provide, and local industry needs. Curated resources are available at rethinkadulted.com to support entrants as they prepare submissions. To learn more, adult education providers can join a virtual information session on Oct. 15, 2020. A review panel will select up to 100 finalists to join Stage 2, which runs from February to July 2021. Finalists will have access to a range of digital resources — such as case studies, activities, and webinars with subject matter experts — to help them refine their designs and develop more detailed program proposals. A judging panel will review the submitted proposals and select one grand-prize winner and up to five runners-up.

The Expanding Access to Well-Rounded Courses Demonstration Grants Program supports school districts' efforts to develop distance-learning opportunities, expand their course offerings, and ensure students have access to a broad range of advanced, career or technical, and other courses. The Well-Rounded Education Through Student-Centered Funding Demonstration Grants Program allows funding to follow individual students so that school districts can allocate resources in a way that provides a customized approach to education that considers individual needs in order to improve academic achievement. ""For more than 30 years, I've advocated not only for funding to follow students but also for students to have access to individualized education options tailored to meet their unique needs,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""These two grant programs allow school districts the opportunity to do just that. Student-centered education—tailored to unique talents, skills, abilities and interests—is the future. I look forward to seeing positive results for students."" The Expanding Access to Well-Rounded Courses Demonstration Grants Program provides $9.6 million this year to six state educational agencies to develop or expand and implement models for providing well-rounded educational opportunities through increased course access for all students, including rural, disadvantaged, or those with disabilities. Potential course options that could be added by participating states include those related to the arts, science, technology, engineering, mathematics, computer science, career and technical education and advanced level coursework. The Well-Rounded Education Through Student-Centered Funding Demonstration Grants Program provides over $1 million this year to two local educational agencies (LEAs) to demonstrate model programs for providing well-rounded education opportunities through the development and implementation of student-centered funding systems. The goal of the program is to help LEAs develop models for expanding and enhancing delivery of such opportunities for educationally disadvantaged students. Both grant programs are funded through a required 2% set-aside of funds for technical assistance and capacity building under Title IV, Part A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965.

The tool will radically increase transparency as parents and local leaders seek to understand funding levels and differences between schools. States are required by the bipartisan Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) to provide this funding information called Per Pupil Expenditure (PPE). Unfortunately, each state provides the information in different ways and places—some more transparently than others. Under Secretary DeVos’ direction, state data will be aggregated and made easily accessible and searchable at studentspending.ed.gov . “Parents are increasingly attuned to how their schools are—or aren’t—meeting their students’ needs,” said Secretary DeVos. “They need tools to advocate for reforms, and good decision-making requires transparent, actionable information that, unfortunately, isn’t always easy to find. That’s why we’ve committed ourselves to fixing that. This new web tool clearly displays per pupil student funding at the building level so parents can see how their money is being spent on students. This is the level of transparency that states and districts should aspire to and that parents deserve.” The tool displays the breakdown of federal, state, and local funds that make up the PPE for each school and district starting with the 2018-2019 school year—the first year that these data were required to be reported on state and local report cards under ESSA. The tool features an interactive map, individual state pages, and a downloadable Excel file. Users can search for individual districts and schools or filter by variables to permit comparisons within states. The new site will also allow users to sort, filter, and compare information between schools and districts within each state. Currently, the website includes data available from the following 20 states for the 2018-19 school year: Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Utah, and West Virginia. The web tool will be updated as additional data become available from states. Please visit studentspending.ed.gov for more information. The site is also accessible on mobile devices."

The new rule will ensure that public institutions of higher education uphold fundamental rights guaranteed by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and that private institutions of higher education adhere to their own policies regarding freedom of speech, including academic freedom. The final rule also ensures the equal treatment and constitutional rights of religious student organizations at public institutions and provides clarity for faith-based institutions with respect to Title IX. ""This administration is committed to protecting the First Amendment rights of students, teachers, and faith-based institutions. Students should not be forced to choose between their faith and their education, and an institution controlled by a religious organization should not have to sacrifice its religious beliefs to participate in Department grants and programs,” said Secretary DeVos. ""These regulations hold public institutions accountable for protecting the First Amendment rights of students and student organizations, and they require private colleges and universities that promise their students and faculty free expression, free inquiry, and diversity of thought to live up to those ideals.” The Department's final rule was created after reviewing more than 17,000 public comments. It addresses four areas of critical importance: First, to implement Executive Order 13864, Improving Free Inquiry, Transparency, and Accountability at Colleges and Universities , public colleges and universities must comply with the First Amendment as a requirement to receive Department grants. Private institutions of higher education must comply with their own stated institutional policies regarding freedom of speech, including academic freedom, as a requirement of Department grants. Due to the well-developed body of case law by state and federal courts on First Amendment rights and violations of stated institutional policies, the Department will rely upon a final, non-default judgment by a state or federal court to determine whether a public or private institution has violated these material grant conditions. Second, the rule clarifies how an institution may demonstrate that it is controlled by a religious organization for purposes of Title IX. Federal law provides that Title IX “shall not apply” to educational institutions that are “controlled by a religious organization,” to the extent that application of Title IX would not be consistent with the religious tenets of such organization. Neither Title IX nor its implementing regulations have ever before defined what it means for a school to be “controlled by a religious organization.” The final rule includes a non-exhaustive list of some of the most common concrete factors that an institution may rely upon to demonstrate that it is “controlled by a religious organization” for Title IX purposes. Third, the rule ensures equal treatment of religious student organizations at public colleges and universities. As a requirement of the Department’s grants, public colleges and universities must not deny to a religious student group any of the rights, benefits, or privileges that other student groups enjoy. For example, a religious student group must have the same rights as other student groups at the public institution to receive official recognition, to use the institution’s facilities, and to receive student fee funds. Equal treatment of religious student groups is now a material condition of the Department’s grants. Fourth, the rule revises regulations governing some discretionary grant programs under Titles III and V of the Higher Education Act of 1964, as amended, to better align with the First Amendment and other federal laws. Current regulations could prohibit a school from using such a grant for even secular activities or services such as teaching a course about world religions. The rule more narrowly tailors the prohibition on the use of these grants to religious instruction, religious worship, or proselytization. The rule also more narrowly defines a “school or department of divinity” to clarify that institutions are not prohibited from using grants for a secular department of religion. A fact sheet on the final rule is available here . The final rule will be effective 60 days after the date of official publication in the Federal Register."

The students come from more than 18,750 public, private, and military schools from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, and American military bases abroad. ""The President and I are pleased to congratulate this year's honorees and celebrate their success alongside their families, teachers, and mentors who have guided them along the way,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""These students excelled even in the face of the unique adversity posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Their dedication to overcoming obstacles in pursuit of education will serve them well throughout their lifelong learning journeys."" PEAP was founded in 1983. Every year since then, the program has provided our nation's schools with the opportunity to recognize graduating students who meet high standards of academic excellence and those who have given their best effort, often overcoming obstacles to their learning. Each year, eligible graduating K-12 students are selected by their school principals for recognition in two categories: The President's Award for Educational Excellence —This award recognizes academic success in the classroom. To be eligible, students must meet requirements, including grade point average or other school-set criteria and choice of state tests or teacher recommendations. The President's Award for Educational Achievement —This award recognizes students that show outstanding educational growth, improvement, commitment, or intellectual development in their academic subjects but do not meet the criteria for the Educational Excellence Award. Its purpose is to encourage and reward students who give their best effort, often in the face of special obstacles. Criterion for this award is developed at each school. Individual recognition is bestowed by the President and the U.S. Secretary of Education, in partnership with the National Association of Elementary School Principals and the National Association of Secondary School Principals. The award includes a congratulatory letter to the student and certificate signed by the President, the Secretary, and the school principal. Unlike other awards programs, the principal has sole discretion in choosing recipients based on eligibility. There is no limit on the number of awards as long as students meet the criteria for each award set by the school. Despite the uncertainty and challenges related to COVID-19, the program continued to accept and fulfill nominations through July so that student recognition could continue. A list of schools, by state and territory, participating in the 2020 President's Education Awards Program is available here . A recent Homeroom blog shares stories of graduating PEAP honorees as demonstrative of the achievement and improvement of recipients."

While work on the Distance Learning and Innovation regulation started more than a year ago, the COVID-19 national emergency underscores the need for students to have access to high-quality remote learning options. “While we moved quickly at the start of the pandemic to provide temporary distance learning flexibilities for students, these new regulations provide a permanent upgrade to online and competency-based education,” said Secretary DeVos. “The COVID-19 pandemic has shown that a video call is not enough, and our outdated rules did not comport with 21st-century realities. These regulations are a true ‘rethink’ of what is possible for students so that they can learn in the ways and places that work best for them.” Crafted by a diverse group of experts during the Department’s 2019 negotiated rulemaking, the Department’s Distance Education and Innovation regulations were forged by historic rulemaking consensus, enhance educational quality, and reduce barriers to innovation while maintaining safeguards to limit the risks to students and taxpayers. These regulations build upon Secretary DeVos’ call for institutions, educators, and policy makers to “rethink higher education” and find new ways to expand educational opportunity, demonstrate the value of a postsecondary credential and lifelong learning, and reduce costs for students and schools. The final regulations: Emphasize demonstrated learning over seat time. Remove confusion over whether a course is eligible for Title IV aid by defining ""regular and substantive"" interaction between students and instructors. Clarify and simplify the requirements for direct assessment programs, including how to determine equivalent credit hours. Add a definition of ""juvenile justice facility"" to ensure that incarcerated students remain Pell eligible. Allow students enrolled in Title IV, Higher Education Act (HEA)-eligible foreign institutions to complete up to 25% of their programs at an eligible institution in the United States. This provision is particularly important for students temporarily unable to attend courses abroad due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Encourage employer participation in developing educational programs. Create a new, student-centric system for disbursing Title IV, HEA assistance to students in subscription-based programs. Require prompt action by the Department on applications to participate, or continue to participate, as an eligible institution in the HEA, Title IV program. In the past, these applications have been stalled for months or even years. Allow clock hour programs, which often lead to state licensed occupations, to utilize innovative learning models. The Distance Education and Innovation rule was the result of a months-long negotiated rulemaking effort that began with public hearings and engaged a subcommittee of subject matter experts to formulate recommendations that were ultimately considered by a panel of representatives from the higher education and consumer protection communities. Negotiators reached consensus on the language, which strikes a balance between fostering innovation and protecting students and taxpayers from waste, fraud, and abuse. The regulations will officially take effect July 1, 2021, but institutions have the ability to voluntarily utilize the new flexibilities as soon as the regulation is officially published in the Federal Register."

Trump's Presidential Memorandum signed August 8, 2020, U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos today directed Federal Student Aid (FSA) to extend the student loan relief to borrowers initiated by the President and Secretary in March 2020 through December 31, 2020. All borrowers with federally held student loans will have their payments automatically suspended until 2021 without penalty. In addition, the interest rate on all federally held student loans will be set to 0% through the end of the calendar year. Borrowers will continue to have the option to make payments if they so choose. Doing so will allow borrowers to pay off their loans more quickly and at a lower cost. ""Thanks to President Trump's leadership, students can continue their education and borrowers can enjoy relief from some of the financial stress many may be facing due to the coronavirus pandemic,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""We want everyone to be focused on a safe return to full-time learning. The President and I will continue to support the success of all students."" Today's action extends the actions taken by Secretary DeVos at the start of the national emergency and maintained under law by the CARES Act, which allow borrowers to temporarily defer their payments without accruing interest. During this extended time frame for the payment suspension, collections on defaulted, federally held loans are still halted, and any borrower with defaulted federally held loans whose employer continues to garnish their wages will receive a refund of those garnishments. Non-payments by borrowers working full-time for qualifying employers will count toward the 120 payments required by the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program and as payments that are required to receive forgiveness under an income-driven repayment plan. FSA is working in partnership with its student loan servicers to notify borrowers of this extension of loan relief measures, and this outreach effort will continue through the fall and toward an eventual return to repayment. FSA's servicers are working to make these changes, and borrowers can expect to see this extension reflected in their accounts over the next several weeks.

The grants can be utilized in a variety of ways, including resuming operations, supporting students, reducing disease transmission, and developing more agile instructional delivery models for students who cannot or choose not to attend classes in person. This grant program also recognizes the benefits to high school students of starting their college career early – while still in high school – and gives priority to applicants who plan to expand those opportunities to students who live or attend high school in an Opportunity Zone or rural community. ""This grant program will help students stay on track toward their educational goals by sustaining their learning opportunities and even creating new ones,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""For schools in need, these grants will help them keep their doors open and will pave the way for them to come back stronger than before."" Funds for the Institutional Resilience and Expanded Postsecondary Opportunity (IREPO) program come from the Education Stabilization Fund (ESF), authorized by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act , which was signed into law by President Donald J. Trump on March 27th, 2020. Priority for grant awards will be given to colleges and universities with the greatest unmet needs related to COVID-19. In addition, proposals will receive additional consideration if they: Provide Dual Enrollment Opportunities to Students Who Live or Attend School in a Rural Community or Opportunity Zone; Are led by, or include as partners, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Tribal Colleges, Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs), and/or developing institutions that are eligible to participate in Title III or Title V programs; and/or Are committed to developing more resilient instructional delivery models, such as distance learning, that make learning possible even when students cannot be physically present on campus for any reason.

High school students from across the country are invited to design and build CubeSat (cube satellite) prototypes, or satellites that aid in space research, bringing space missions out of the clouds and into the classroom. “This is such an exciting way to rethink education and get students engaged in hands-on learning in the growing aerospace and technology fields,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. “I look forward to seeing the innovative prototypes students develop and hope this challenge inspires our next generation of American space explorers.” Investors predict that space will be the next trillion-dollar industry , and as missions in space continue to expand, so do the career opportunities. This multi-phase challenge offers high school students across the United States the chance to build CubeSat prototypes while learning creative, collaborative, and technical skills for 21st century careers. Schools interested in entering CTE Mission: CubeSat should form a team and submit a mission proposal by 5:59 p.m. ET, on Oct. 16, 2020 — no in-person collaboration or prior experience with CubeSats is required. The online submission form asks for school information, a team profile, a project proposal, and anticipated learning outcomes. Curated educational resources are available to students and teachers online in the CTE Mission: CubeSat resource hub . To learn more, schools can join a virtual information session on Sept. 1. Up to five finalists will be selected to receive prizes and participate in Phase 2, which runs from January to May 2021. Finalists will have access to expert mentorship and additional virtual resources as they build CubeSat prototypes and plan flight events to launch their prototypes. The Department understands that due to current conditions, schools will need flexibility to safely collaborate when designing and building prototypes during the challenge. The Department looks forward to the creative solutions in the mission proposals it receives as challenge entries. Each finalist will receive an equal share of the $25,000 cash prize pool, as well as satellite development, hardware, and software kits. Challenge sponsors include Arduino, Blue Origin, Chevron, EnduroSat, LEGO Education, Magnitude.io, MIT Media Lab, and XinaBox. “Developing a CubeSat prototype is an opportunity for students to learn competitive skills and explore a wide range of careers in space — or their own communities,” said Assistant Secretary for Career, Technical, and Adult Education Scott Stump. “Through CTE Mission: CubeSat, we aim to bring students new learning opportunities to build valuable technical skills for in-demand and rewarding careers.” About Ed Prizes CTE Mission: CubeSat is part of Ed Prizes, a series of prize competitions to develop new products and services to both increase access to, and expand the capacity of, career and technical education.

""The Administration is focused on making sure each and every student has access to the education opportunities they need to reach their full potential,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""All too often, minority students lack access to STEM education and are underrepresented in STEM jobs. That's why this grant program is so important. It provides HBCUs and other MSIs the opportunity to expand and enhance their STEM offerings so their students can be prepared for the science and technology jobs of today and tomorrow."" The grant is part of the Department of Education's Minority Science and Engineering Improvement Program (MSEIP) , which supports expanding the scientific and technological capacity of the United States to build global competitiveness by increasing the number of minority graduates in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. The program awards grants through a competition among eligible applicant institutions, which include the following: Public and private nonprofit accredited institutions of higher education with minority enrollments that exceed 50% of total enrollment Professional scientific societies Nonprofit science-oriented organizations Nonprofit four-year accredited colleges and universities that provide needed services to a group of eligible minority institutions or that provide special training for project directors, scientists, and engineers from eligible minority institutions. This grant program is the latest in a long-term effort by the Administration to support and significantly increase investment in HBCUs and their students. In December 2019, Secretary DeVos worked with Congress to pass the FUTURE Act to permanently provide more than $250 million a year to HBCUs and other MSIs. Additionally, the Administration has focused on increasing HBCU competitiveness by requiring federal agencies to develop annual plans to help foster public-private partnerships between these institutions and businesses and organizations in their communities.

This action is part of ongoing efforts by the Department to advance religious liberty protections and delivers on President Donald J. Trump’s Executive Order 13798, “ Promoting Free Speech and Religious Liberty .” “This Administration will continue to protect the religious liberty and First Amendment rights of every student, teacher and educational institution across the country,” said Secretary DeVos. “Too many misinterpret the ‘separation of church and state’ as an invitation for government to separate people from their faith. In reality, the First Amendment doesn’t exist to protect us from religion. It exists to protect religion from government. Today’s guidance reaffirms our commitment to protecting our first liberty and ensuring that discriminatory restrictions on access to federal grant funding are no longer tolerated.” This guidance follows recent Supreme Court victories for religious liberty, as Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue and Trinity Lutheran v. Comer curtailed religious discrimination and thus strengthened protections for religious organizations. The guidance was drafted pursuant to a directive from the Office of Management and Budget requiring each agency to publish policies detailing how they will administer federal grants in compliance with Executive Order 13798, as well as the Attorney General’s Oct. 6, 2017, Memorandum on Religious Liberty, and the Office of Management and Budget’s Jan. 16, 2020, Memorandum. Notably, the guidance announces a new process by which individuals and organizations can inform the Department of a burden or potential burden on their religious exercise under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) to adequately protect their religious liberties while participating in Department programs. The new guidance also, consistent with First Amendment principles and Department regulations, does the following: Affirms that religious organizations are equally eligible to participate in ED-administered programs as their secular counterparts Affirms that financial award decisions are made based on merit, not based on an organization’s religion, religious belief, or the lack thereof States that religious organizations receiving federal financial assistance under a Department program must comply with program-specific legislation and regulations, but clarifies that these organizations may continue to carry out their missions and maintain their religious character However, direct federal financial assistance may not be used for religious worship, religious instruction, or proselytization Reminds states that they may not use discriminatory Blaine Amendments to deny faith-based organizations contracts or grants, as this violates Department regulations against discrimination on the basis of an organization’s religious character or affiliation Affirms that students and/or borrowers seeking to participate in Department loan programs and beneficiaries seeking to participate in Department social service programs will not be penalized or singled out for disadvantages on the basis of religion Clarifies the role of the Department’s Center for Faith and Opportunity Initiatives (CFOI) as a Department office that collaborates with faith and community leaders to maximize participation of religious organizations in Department programs while eliminating barriers in the grantmaking or regulatory process to safeguard religious liberty Full text of the guidance can be found here ."

The awards range from $6 million to $20 million. “Ensuring every student can continue to learn during the coronavirus pandemic requires innovation from local education leaders and a laser-like focus on doing what’s right for students,” said Secretary DeVos. “This grant will help states adapt and overcome challenges to strengthen education both now and for the longer term. If we’ve learned anything from this pandemic, it’s that the antiquated one-size-fits-all approach to education is no longer tenable and education going forward must be more adaptable and student-centered. I want to congratulate today’s awardees for making the needed effort to rethink education on behalf of their students.” Congress set aside 1% of the $30.75 billion allotted to the Education Stabilization Fund through the CARES Act for grants to states with the highest coronavirus burden. The Department of Education announced the Rethink K-12 Education Models (REM) grant competition in April 2020, inviting any state educational agency to apply. The program supports new, innovative ways to access education with an emphasis on meeting students’ needs during the coronavirus national emergency. Specifically, it called for projects to provide families with: Microgrants, so that states can ensure families have access to the technology and services to advance learning remotely (absolute priority 1); Statewide virtual learning and course access programs, so that students can access a full range of subjects, even those not taught in their assigned setting (absolute priority 2); or New, field-initiated models for providing remote education to ensure that every child is learning and preparing for successful careers and lives (absolute priority 3).

New York will provide over 190,000 teachers and educational leaders with a combined 450,000 hours of professional support to implement effective practices in remote/hybrid teaching and learning, which, in turn, will reach an estimated two million students. Louisiana will provide over 75,000 students access to microgrants for remote learning resources, including at least 12,000 who will receive devices or hotspots through the program. Rhode Island will enhance its virtual Advanced Course Access program so that middle and high school students have access to a richer, more diverse set of course offerings, and elementary school students can access the program as well. South Carolina will provide all students access to a robust virtual education ecosystem, including the use of “datacasting,” an innovative concept that can help provide instructional content to students without internet access. Applications were evaluated by a panel of independent peer reviewers, and the highest-scoring applications received funding. Given the nature of the national emergency, states with the highest coronavirus burden were prioritized. The Department continues to update www.ed.gov/coronavirus with information for students, parents, educators and local leaders about how to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

The Annual Report illustrates the significant progress made throughout the first three fiscal years of the Trump Administration (FYs 2017-19) in processing complaints, closing cases, and requiring schools to protect students' civil rights. ""This report demonstrates that OCR is once again the neutral, fact-finding agency that it should be, and as a result, students have seen swift justice when their school has failed to protect them,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""Despite the media's efforts to ignore OCR's track record under this Administration, the facts speak for themselves: Because of the hard work at the Office for Civil Rights, more students are getting results, and institutions are being held accountable. I applaud Assistant Secretary Marcus and the entire OCR team for this important accomplishment on behalf of students."" ""As I look back at what OCR has accomplished over the last few years, I am deeply proud to have been a part of this work and grateful to my hardworking and dedicated colleagues who enforce the federal civil rights laws on behalf of our nation's students and their families,"" said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Kenneth L. Marcus. ""Together, we have made a real difference in so many areas and, more importantly, in the lives of so many students. As a result of our focus on enforcement and fidelity to the law, we have in fact achieved better results for our nation's children."" In the previous report, the Annual Report to the Secretary, the President, and the Congress for fiscal years (FYs) 2017-18 , OCR highlighted the drastic improvement in the quality and quantity of OCR's case resolutions. During the first two years under the Trump Administration, OCR has vastly outpaced its activity under the Obama Administration. In one year alone, OCR has launched three times more proactive investigations than the prior administration launched in all eight years combined. It has also resolved nearly double the number of civil rights complaints per year and achieved a 60% increase in the annual number of complaints resolved with change compared to the prior eight fiscal years. In this year's report, OCR illustrates how it has built on those successes while, at the same time, accomplishing several additional milestones during FY 2019, including: Launching over 700 proactive investigations in two national initiatives focused on improving outcomes for students with disabilities; For the first time in a decade, reducing the number of complaints older than 180 days in every one of OCR's 12 regional offices; Resolving one of the most extensive investigations that OCR has ever conducted in American higher education, requiring Michigan State University to make sweeping changes to the way it addresses sexual assault in light of its mishandling of sexual misconduct by Larry Nassar and others; Completing the largest ever OCR investigation into systemic sexual assault problems in an urban public school system, requiring Chicago Public Schools to overhaul the process it uses to handle reports of sexual harassment; Establishing the National Web Accessibility Team, a nationwide team of dedicated OCR staff, including attorneys, investigators, and information technology experts, to make technology accessible to all, including students with disabilities; Improving the quality of OCR's authoritative Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC) by instituting data quality reforms and expanding a partnership with the Department's National Center for Education Statistics; and Conducting landmark regulatory reform by proposing a rule that would codify, for the first time, a school's obligations under Title IX with respect to claims of sexual misconduct. In addition, OCR has substantially reduced the backlog of pending complaints inherited from the prior administration. During this process, OCR resolved significantly more complaints with change compared to the prior three years. Over the course of FYs 2017, 2018, and 2019, OCR: Closed 6,431 of the 7,854 complaints inherited from the prior administration in January 2017; Resolved 42,515 complaints—which is nearly 15,000 more resolutions than the previous administration achieved during FYs 2014, 2015, and 2016 combined; and Achieved a total of 4,656 complaint resolutions with change over three years, or 1,507 more complaints resolved with requiring schools to make a change to their policies and procedures than the previous administration achieved during FYs 2014, 2015, and 2016. Pursuant to Section 203(b)(1) of the Department of Education Organization Act of 1979, the Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights is required to make a report ""to the Secretary, the President, and the Congress summarizing the compliance and enforcement activities of the Office for Civil Rights and identifying significant civil rights or compliance problems as to which such Office has made a recommendation for corrective action and as to which, in the Judgement of the Assistant Secretary, adequate progress is not being made."" 20 U.S.C. § 3414(b)(1). Each of OCR's Annual Reports since FY 1990 are made publicly available on OCR's website here ."
22-Jul-20,https://web.archive.org/web/20210108025343/https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/trump-administration-announces-85-million-support-disadvantaged-students-nations-capital-attending-k-12-private-schools-their-choice,Trump Administration Announces $85 Million to Support Disadvantaged Students in Nation’s Capital Attending K-12 Private Schools of Their Choice,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos announced today that the Department of Education will award at least $85 million over the next five years for disadvantaged students from families with lower incomes in Washington, D.C., to attend private schools of their choice, as part of the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program. The D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program (DCOSP) is the only federally-funded school choice program in the nation. The program was restored by President Donald J. Trump in May 2017 following a cruel decision by the Obama Administration to cut its funding. “Students and parents love the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program because it gives them the freedom to choose the right education fit for them,” said Secretary DeVos. “When students find their right fit, we know they’re more likely to succeed. While too many Democrats in Congress continue to do the bidding of union bosses who want nothing more than to defund this successful program, this administration will continue to be on the side of students and parents. This program should not be subject to political whims. It was established because the students and parents of D.C., led by my dear friend Virginia Walden Ford, demanded it, and bipartisan leaders in Congress came together to do what was right. President Trump and I will continue to fight to grow DCOSP and we won't rest until every student in America has access to an education that best matches their learning needs and prepares them for future success.” Annually, DCOSP awards scholarships to more than 1,500 students living in Washington, D.C., enabling them to attend private schools of their choice. The average income of participating families is less than $27,000 per year, and more than 90% of participating students identify as Black or Hispanic/Latino. The Trump Administration is also working to expand DCOSP, so that more students can take advantage of the life-changing power of education freedom. In the Fiscal Year 2021 Budget Request, the President asked Congress to nearly double funding for the program from $17.5 million in FY 2020 to $30 million. Today’s news follows an announcement by the U.S. Department of Education in February 2020 that it would hold a competition to identify a nonprofit organization to administer the program for the next five years. A panel of independent peer reviewers evaluated the applications. The winner was the incumbent program administrator, Serving Our Children, a nonprofit organization headquartered in Washington, D.C., that will administer the scholarships and provide support services to recipients and their families. BACKGROUND The D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program was authorized by Congress in 2003 with bipartisan support. The Obama Administration repeatedly tried to end the program by cutting its funding. The action was called “hypocritical and wrong” by leading Black and Hispanic education advocacy groups. The average income of participating families is less than $27,000 per year. Nearly 10,000 scholarships for low-income students have been awarded over the lifetime of the program. Over 75% of scholarship students reside in Wards 4, 7 and 8 of Washington, D.C., and would otherwise be assigned to failing traditional public schools. Whereas only 69% of D.C. public school students graduated from high school in recent years, nearly 98% of scholarship recipients graduate, with 86% of those graduates going on to attend a college of their choice. Nearly 40,000 students have applied for a scholarship over the lifetime of the program, indicating both the demand and the need for more choice options. Serving Our Children is the incumbent program administrator and will now continue to operate the program for the next five years. Today’s action will result in the immediate award of $17 million for Fiscal Year 2020, and an estimated $85 million over the next five years."

The Accessing Choices in Education (ACE) grants will allow tribes, or other education entities partnering with tribes, to set up a variety of education options and services from which parents or students can choose. ""This pandemic has made very clear that education needs to be more adaptable and student-centered,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""Tragically, too many Native American students lack access to a high quality education option that meets their unique needs. The ACE grant program helps to accomplish this for Native American families in two ways. First, it respects tribal sovereignty by empowering tribes to select the range of resources to offer students including things like tutoring, educational or technology supplies, and Native language, history or culture courses. In turn, parents and students are then empowered to select the resources that are the right fit for them. I look forward to seeing how this unique program impacts the long-term success of Native American students."" An ACE proposal must include more than one education option from which parents and students may choose, including: advanced, remedial, or elective courses (including online); apprenticeships or training programs; concurrent or dual enrollment options; native language, history, or culture courses; supplemental counseling services; tuition; summer or afterschool education programs, and student transportation needed for those specific programs; and many other education-related services that the tribe determines are needed in its community. Additionally, grantees will be required to set up a parent feedback process and respond to parent requests for specific services not already offered throughout project implementation. The ACE grants cover three years, with an additional two years of support available if the project is achieving objectives. Grantees may use up to the first year of the grant for planning needs, such as hiring personnel, securing service providers for options provided to students, and developing a method to collect parent feedback.

We know that a great education is also the launching pad to a great job and long-term prosperity. I applaud President Trump’s strong leadership in support of more educational opportunities and greater prosperity for all Hispanic Americans. At the U.S. Department of Education, we’re working to open up new career pathways including apprenticeships and earn-and-learn opportunities, expanding support for Hispanic Serving Institutions, prioritizing new public charter schools in Opportunity Zones, and fighting for education freedom so Hispanic students—and all students—can find their right fit."""
1-Jul-20,https://web.archive.org/web/20210108025343/https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/several-secretary-devos-rethink-higher-education-regulations-take-effect-today-department-issues-new-rule-protect-religious-liberty-reform-teach-grant-program,"Several of Secretary DeVos' Rethink Higher Education Regulations Take Effect Today as Department Issues New Rule to Protect Religious Liberty, Reform TEACH Grant Program","WASHINGTON — Several new regulations based on U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos' Rethink Higher Education agenda take effect today, including rules forged by historic consensus negotiated rulemaking on accreditation and state authorization reform. This comes as the U.S Department of Education publishes today a new regulation, also agreed to by a diverse panel of negotiators, to guarantee the Constitutional rights of religious organizations that participate in Federal Student Aid programs and improve the Teacher Education Assistance for College Higher Education (TEACH) grants program. ""We've made tremendous progress during the last three years, challenging everyone in the higher education community to rethink how we approach education with an eye toward putting students at the center of everything that we do,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""We tackled a huge regulatory overhaul, and thanks to achieving historic consensus among higher education leaders, have published several new rules that will improve access to higher education for students, lower the cost, reduce regulatory burden for schools, and protect taxpayers who subsidize higher education. The coronavirus disruption to education has made even more clear the need for higher education to be more nimble, agile, and relevant for students, and I believe the regulations going into effect today help to make that possible. I'm proud of the work this team has done and hope that it will have a long-lasting, positive impact that lays the groundwork for additional student-centered reforms."" The Department's Accreditation and State Authorization regulations will expand educational options for students, protect schools with religious missions, lower accreditation costs borne by institutions of higher education, clarify an institution's responsibility for determining where a student resides and what distance learning rules impact that student, and ensure occupationally-focused education meets current workforce needs. The regulations also replace the idea of a one-size-fits-all standard with accountability requirements that align with an institution's program offerings and mission. These new regulations also recognize that students and accrediting organizations are not limited to a specific geographic region, so they end the outdated concept of regional accreditation and clarify that the Department holds all accreditors to the same standards. As a result, students should not face barriers to career entry and mobility or to continuing education, based solely on which accreditor oversees the school they attended. Additional regulations taking effect today include the Department's overhaul of the Obama Administration's disastrous Gainful Employment and Borrower Defense regulations. In their place, the Department promulgated new regulations that protect individual borrowers from fraud, ensure accountability across institutions of higher education, require due process, and protect taxpayers. In addition, to ensure that all students and families have access to information about college costs, related debt, and post-graduation earnings, the Department expanded the College Scorecard to provide program-level data that can help all students make informed decisions about the likely costs and financial benefits of the programs they are considering. The Faith-Based Institutions and TEACH Grants Final Rule published today guarantees the Constitutional rights of religious students who participate in Federal Student Aid programs and institutions that participate in the Department's various funding opportunities. These new regulations ensure that student loan borrowers no longer have to forfeit their access to public benefits, like loan forgiveness, simply because they choose to work at faith-based, non-profit institutions. The rule also allows hardworking teachers to focus on teaching their students rather than burdensome paperwork requirements with random deadlines. This will ensure that the TEACH Program grants won't be erroneously converted to loans. These regulations also recognize the importance of all elementary school teachers, not just those who teach English as a second language and special education programs, in providing the foundation that students need to enjoy academic success throughout their lifetimes. As a result, elementary school teachers will be able to fulfill their TEACH grant obligations if they teach at a school that meets program requirements. These regulations codify the changes the Department already put into place when the Secretary learned that hardworking teachers were seeing their grants convert to loans, simply because they missed a paperwork deadline.

Trump on July 31, 2018. Alaska, Connecticut, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, and West Virginia are the latest states, along with Puerto Rico, to have their CTE plans approved. Nine additional states combined their CTE plans with their Workforce Innovation and Opportunities Act (WIOA) plans which have also been approved: Alabama, Delaware, Indiana, Minnesota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia, and Washington. “Thanks to the president’s leadership, the new career and technical education law gives local leaders the flexibility to make investments in the highest impact areas of local need,” said Secretary DeVos. “We know many well-paying, in-demand jobs require CTE training but not necessarily a college degree and the associated debt. The coronavirus pandemic has certainly highlighted the need for all education to be tailored to meet each student’s unique needs, more nimble, and relevant to 21st-century realities. High-quality CTE programs are a critical way to help learners of all ages and get our economy back up and running at full speed.” Perkins V encourages states and territories to expand opportunities for every student to access educational opportunities that will put them on the path to success. Each state and territory crafted a plan to fulfill its promise of offering a robust CTE option for students following consultation with its key constituents representing education and workforce, business and industry, and parents and community partners. To date, the Department has approved 42 Perkins plans and nine WIOA Combined State Plans that include career and technical education. California and Palau have been granted an extension to submit their plans due to COVID-19 disruptions. Details on each approved plan can be found on the Department’s website . Alaska Provides incentive grants to secondary-level school districts to pioneer strategies that increase access in CTE. Aligns statewide CTE programs to economic priorities so that learners may seamlessly transition into the workforce. Promotes expectations that CTE students earn postsecondary credentials and/or certifications that offer “multiple exit points” and value in the labor market. Connecticut Incentivizes school districts to offer students opportunities to participate in work-based learning and earn Industry-recognized credentials. Increases the number of high school students who successfully complete CTE courses that count toward postsecondary credits or lead to an industry-recognized credential or certificate. Identifies industry recognized credentials aligned to state/regional workforce needs that carry the highest value among employers. New Jersey Ensures school counselors are prepared to support students through ongoing career advisement and development by collaborating with One-Stop Career Centers, local workforce development boards, and other local business and industry partners. Prioritizes the development of early college programs to increase equity of opportunity and access to CTE statewide through its competitive funds. Increases the number of high school students (at least 16 years old) participating in and completing pre-apprenticeship programs, and expands its community colleges’ efforts driven by the needs of the state’s health care and advanced manufacturing industries. New Mexico Ensures access to CTE in rural areas by promoting regional-level partnerships among secondary and postsecondary educators and business employers. Ensures programmatic alignment between secondary and postsecondary education by promoting shared goals and resources, such as professional development, among its CTE educators. Increases clarity in its state student data collection by providing consistent definitions of high school CTE students who complete postsecondary dual credit, Advanced Placement courses, and/or work-based learning experiences. North Carolina Places high schools on community college and university campuses so students simultaneously complete a high school diploma and an associate degree, transferable credit, or certificate. Creates local and regional CTE education and workforce development programs that align worker preparation to employer needs in high-demand occupations. Adopts a shared educational attainment goal among its public and private sectors so that by 2030, 2 million North Carolinians (ages 25-44) will hold a high-quality postsecondary degree or credential. Puerto Rico Launches recruitment efforts to promote CTE program awareness to underrepresented populations. Expands existing CTE programs that are aligned with its high-skill, high-wage occupations in in-demand industries by leveraging the Perkins Reserve Funds. Promotes job placement and provides workforce training opportunities among various industry sectors through CTE programs. West Virginia Embeds employability skills in all secondary CTE programs through its Simulated Workplace Initiative— one of the newest collaborations between its secondary schools and employers to assist schools in implementing workplace protocols. Launches a statewide initiative to increase the number of West Virginians with earned industry-valued certificates and/or degrees. Improves results for its “Earn a Degree Graduate Early Program” that prepares high school students for success in the workplace or postsecondary education.

Montana Department of Revenue case: ""Today’s decision is a historic victory for America’s students and all those who believe in fundamental fairness and freedom. Each and every student needs the freedom to find their education fit, and today the Highest Court in the Land has protected that right by ensuring that families can use taxpayer funds to choose schools that match their values and educational goals, including faith-based schools. I applaud the Court’s decision to assign a manifestation of the 'last acceptable prejudice' to the dustbin of history where it belongs. Montana and other states should be very clear about this historic decision: your bigoted Blaine Amendments and other restrictions like them are unconstitutional, dead, and buried. Too many students have been discriminated against based on their faith and have been forced to stay in schools that don’t match their values. This decision represents a turning point in the sad and static history of American education, and it will spark a new beginning of education that focuses first on students and their needs. I’m calling on all states to now seize the extraordinary opportunity to expand all education options at all schools to every single student in America."""

The Rural Tech Project, with a total cash prize pool of $600,000, invites high schools and local educational agencies (LEAs) to develop competency-based distance learning programs that enable students to master skills at their own pace with the goal of preparing them for the well-paying, in-demand jobs of today and tomorrow. Amid the coronavirus pandemic, schools across the country have had to grapple with how to successfully continue to educate students who are not physically in a classroom. “Our rural tech challenge is a tremendous opportunity for educators in rural communities to rethink how students access education,” said Secretary DeVos. “As I’ve said many times, a student’s education shouldn’t be arbitrarily limited by what’s available inside their brick-and-mortar classroom, and that’s never been more apparent than now as the coronavirus pandemic has made clear the need for more innovation to ensure all students have access to robust educational options. I look forward to seeing the student-centered approaches to tech education our challenge participants develop and hope they serve as examples for other schools as they create their own technology education programs that will prepare students for well-paying, in-demand careers.” Rural high schools and LEAs interested in entering the challenge should submit a proposal for a competency-based program by 5:59 p.m. ET on Oct. 8, 2020. The online submission form asks for a program overview, including the delivery model, curriculum topics, and intended collaboration with local employers and other partners. Up to five finalists will each receive an equal share of the initial $500,000 prize pool and progress to Phase 2. From January to June 2021, finalists will develop detailed program plans and build partnerships before programs launch. They will have on-the-ground assistance, expert mentorship, and access to virtual resources as they plan, run, and refine their programs for two academic years. Finalists will also be supported by a Community Engagement Manager, who will assist with on-the-ground setup, implementation, and evaluation of each program. During summer 2023, finalists will document their outcomes and learnings in a final submission; the judging panel will then recommend one grand-prize winner to receive an additional $100,000. The Rural Tech Project will compile insights from all finalists and share lessons learned as a resource for other communities. “No matter where they want to work or what they want to do, today’s high school students will need advanced technology skills,” said Assistant Secretary for Career, Technical and Adult Education Scott Stump. “The Rural Tech Project will empower schools with resources to create technology education programs that will help break down the barriers between education and industry.” To learn more, rural high schools and LEAs can join a virtual information session on July 21. Entrants can find additional resources online at ruraltechproject.com . About Ed Prizes The Rural Tech Project is part of Ed Prizes, a series of prize competitions to develop new products and services to both increase access to, and expand the capacity of, career and technical education.

All too often, workers have been denied opportunities that match their skills because they lacked a traditional degree, and industries have missed out on capable employees because of arbitrary postsecondary degree requirements. It’s long past time to extend credit to workers for the talents they bring, even if those abilities aren’t learned while earning a traditional degree, and today’s Executive Order ensures the federal government does that going forward. ""I continue to challenge the business community to rethink education and to embrace potential employees who have gained their experience and skills outside of the typical classroom—including serving our country through military service. Learning is a lifelong journey, and there are many ways to acquire the knowledge and skills needed to succeed in the workforce. I thank President Trump for his leadership on this issue, which will benefit students, lifelong learners, and all American workers."""

The Interim Final Rule (IFR), which becomes effective immediately, outlines how local education agencies (LEAs) must calculate the emergency funds available for providing equitable services to students and teachers in private schools. Providing equitable services is long-standing law under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). LEAs provide no money to private schools under these equitable services provisions. Instead, they provide secular, neutral, and nonideological services to nonpublic schools after consulting with private school leaders about the needs of students and teachers. Under the CARES Act, LEAs have broad latitude about the uses of funds, but it is expected that most of the emergency funding will go toward services like cleaning, equipment to protect student and teacher health, teacher training in remote instruction, and distance education tools. The Department’s IFR discourages the limited number of financially secure private schools from seeking equitable services. “The CARES Act is a special, pandemic-related appropriation to benefit all American students, teachers, and families impacted by coronavirus,” said Secretary DeVos. “There is nothing in the law Congress passed that would allow districts to discriminate against children and teachers based on private school attendance and employment. In this new rule, we recognized that CARES Act programs are not Title I programs. There is no reasonable explanation for debating the use of federal funding to serve both public and private K-12 students when federal funding, including CARES Act funding, flows to both public and private higher education institutions.” Under the rule, if an LEA chooses to use CARES Act funding for students in all its public schools, it still must calculate the funds for equitable services based on students enrolled in private schools in the district. However, if an LEA chooses to use CARES Act funding only for students in its Title I schools, it has two options: Calculate the funds for equitable services based on the total number of low-income students in Title I and participating private schools; or Calculate the funds using the LEA’s Title I, Part A share from the 2019-2020 school year. If an LEA uses one of the low-income student options, the LEA must not violate the Title I supplement-not-supplant requirement in section 1118(b)(2) of the ESEA. That is, LEAs cannot divert state or local funds from its Title I schools because they receive CARES Act funds. Most private schools serving low- and middle-income communities are under great financial strain due to COVID-19 because they are typically dependent on tuition from families and donations from their communities. Because the economic disruptions are shrinking these revenue sources, more than 100 private schools have already announced they will not be able to reopen following the pandemic, and hundreds more are facing a similar fate. The local public schools may have to absorb thousands of students transferring from private schools at a time when public schools are already under their own financial strain. The Department previously issued guidance on equitable services under the CARES Act on April 30, 2020. In the April 30 guidance, the Department advised LEAs to calculate the funds that must be reserved to provide equitable services to private school students and teachers under the CARES Act programs based on enrollment data in a district. So, if private-school students represented 8% of enrollment, the funds for equitable services would be set at 8% of the total funds the LEA received under a CARES Act program. The IFR has been unofficially published here on the Department’s website. Once the rule is officially published in the Federal Register, it will be effective immediately and open for public comment for 30 days"

Edfinancial Services LLC, F.H. Cann & Associates LLC, MAXIMUS Federal Services Inc., Missouri Higher Education Loan Authority (MOHELA), and Texas Guaranteed Student Loan Corporation (Trellis Company) will support customers through direct engagement via contact centers and provide back-office processing support for students, parents, borrowers and partners at more than 5,800 postsecondary institutions. “This is another major step toward our commitment to improving customer service and holding our contractors accountable for their performance,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. “Students, parents, borrowers, and schools deserve a world-class experience when dealing with FSA, and I’m confident that FSA has hired the companies with the knowledge, experience and expertise to deliver that.” The five companies that received contracts today through the Next Gen Business Process Operations (BPO) solicitation will correspond with customers and partners via phone, chat, social media, postal mail, and email and will support the back-office processing that is associated with those contacts. All of these operations will be supported by a centralized loan processing platform and an improved customer experience, including meaningful improvements to FSA’s web presence and outreach capabilities. As part of the new loan servicing environment, FSA will provide comprehensive contact center training and oversight, ensuring that agents have up-to-date knowledge of federal student aid programs to give customers the right answer in every interaction. The contracts signed today also contain 41 objective, measurable service-level agreements that hold vendors to high operational performance standards, including ensuring that customers receive comprehensive counseling and resolution of issues with just one call or email. “Accountability is non-negotiable when it comes to our contractors and to FSA,” said Mark Brown, chief operating officer at Federal Student Aid. “These contracts are a vital step forward in providing our students, borrowers, their families, and partners with better experiences with our programs. We also are taking further steps to streamline FSA operations and protect taxpayer dollars.” FSA will also begin working with the new vendors immediately to ensure their systems meet the department’s rigorous cybersecurity standards. As these five vendors come online, they will begin managing non-servicing work, then take on servicing-related activities. The current loan servicing environment, which Next Gen will replace, features nine different servicers operating on four different platforms, which can lead to customer confusion and inconsistent operations for the federal student loan programs. During repayment, borrowers are assigned to a loan servicer and engage directly with that servicer’s website, which may feature completely different tools, interfaces, branding, and consumer information from another loan servicer’s website. Current loan servicing contracts also allow wide latitude in how servicers manage accounts, including staffing their own contact centers, crafting borrower outreach campaigns, and training customer service representatives. Furthermore, today’s loan servicing environment does not require maximum accountability. The legacy servicing contracts do not contain adequate incentives to reward servicers when they manage borrowers’ accounts successfully, and they do not allow for the appropriate consequences to be applied to loan servicers that fail to meet contract requirements. As the Next Gen FSA initiative seeks to solve these challenges, the vision is for all customers with federally managed loans to seamlessly repay through StudentAid.gov, where customers can receive a consistent set of tools and information that are personalized to their unique circumstances."

Today, we are committed as ever to keeping that promise. ""Our new Title IX rule demonstrates that commitment to all students and their safety. It protects them by holding schools accountable for responding to incidents of sexual misconduct, and requires each institution to adopt fair, transparent, and reliable processes for addressing Title IX complaints. This rule empowers survivors of sexual harassment to ensure that schools take all allegations seriously, and we are proud of our work on this issue. We will continue to enforce Title IX and ensure that all students are protected from unlawful sex discrimination."""

This is part of the Department's ongoing efforts to help higher education institutions come into compliance with Section 117 of the Higher Education Act after numerous reports, and the Department's own research, uncovered billions of dollars in unreported funds from foreign sources. ""Colleges and universities owe it to all of us to be transparent about their foreign financial ties,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""Transparency and accountability help protect academic freedom and our country's national security and economic future. Today, we are making it even easier for colleges and universities to follow the law and provide the transparency Americans deserve."" Currently, the Department is not receiving sufficient information to determine compliance with Section 117's provisions. The new online portal requires institutions to provide more information about their foreign financial ties. For example, institutions must answer specific questions about each reportable transaction involving a foreign source, such as whether the foreign source is a foreign government, a foreign legal entity, an individual who is not a citizen or national of the United States, or a person acting as an agent of a foreign source. Under Secretary DeVos's leadership, the Department's Office of the General Counsel is spearheading Section 117 foreign source compliance and verification efforts, including ongoing investigations into ten American institutions of higher education. To date, the Department has uncovered numerous university contracts with Chinese Communist Party-subsidized companies. At least one institution has multiple direct contracts with the Chinese Communist Party itself. Since July 2019, American institutions have reported $6.5 billion in previously undisclosed foreign gifts and contracts. Institutions have anonymized the identities of the donors of at least $1.14 billion in funds from China, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Russia.

The Reimagine Workforce Preparation Grant Program will be funded through the Education Stabilization Fund (ESF), authorized by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act , signed into law by President Donald J. Trump. “America’s colleges and universities are a national treasure, but it is time for them to reinvent themselves and to be more responsive to the needs of their students and local communities,” said Secretary DeVos. “That includes providing lower-cost options that leverage the expertise of local business leaders and better embrace technological change. Through the Reimagine Workforce Preparation grants, we are empowering them, along with their community partners, educators, business leaders, and entrepreneurs, to do just that. Our goal is to help workers and entrepreneurs get back on their feet and get our economy back up and running as quickly as possible.” The CARES Act provided $307.5 million for discretionary grants, which the Secretary has chosento divide between two competitions: $127.5 million for the Reimagine Workforce Preparation Grant and $180 million for the Rethink K-12 Education Models Grant . The Reimagine Workforce Preparation Grant competition is open to all states, as well as Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia.

""These exemplary students have excelled inside the classroom and out, and have successfully met the unprecedented challenges to learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. Their determination, resilience, and commitment to excellence will serve them well as they continue their academic careers and prepare for future continued success.” Johnathan Holifield, executive director of the White House Initiative on HBCUs, added, “I am simply thrilled to recognize the 2020 HBCU Competitiveness Scholars. These students are fine examples of the talent and boundless vitality found at America’s HBCUs. This recognition heightens expectations for scholars to continue making meaningful contributions to our nation. I am confident they will deliver.” Scholars were chosen based on their academic achievements, campus and civic involvement, and entrepreneurial ethos or ""go-getter"" spirits. Comprised of undergraduate, graduate, professional students, and international students from various academic backgrounds, the 2020 scholars were selected from among several highly distinguished HBCU students. In addition, each recognized scholar was nominated and endorsed by their institution president, which itself is a prestigious acknowledgement. “The Competitiveness Scholars Program is a great way to showcase and recognize HBCU students for their academic, civic and entrepreneurial prowess,” said President James E. Clark, South Carolina State University. “Our students are the leaders of the future, and this program is one of the many ways we celebrate our student leaders and introduce them to society. I could not be any prouder than I am now of the HBCU 2020 cohort of scholars, especially those from SC State.” The initiative remains committed to extending their platform to provide meaningful experiences for HBCU students. Both the initiative and the U.S. Department of Education fully support this 2020 recognition of competitiveness scholars and believe it to be a critical effort to better support and motivate HBCU students during the pandemic. “These scholars are already extraordinary,” said Elyse Jones, scholar program coordinator. “With the drastic changes that have been made to their learning environments, they have still managed to distinguish themselves in their leadership and service, continued to foster their student voices, and furthermore embodied what it means to have a ‘competitiveness spirit.’ Their ability to stay so diligent in their studies and invested in their personal growth during a time of uncertainty speaks volumes to the character of these students.” Selected students will serve for one academic school year representing the 2020-2021 cohort of Competitiveness Scholars. During this unique academic school year, the initiative will work closely with our federal and non-federal partners to develop a robust calendar of virtual events for our scholars that will explore and exchange ideas, and share best practices around leadership, professional development, career pathways, government resources, and much more. “ North Carolina A&T is delighted to participate in the HBCU Competitiveness Scholars Program and very proud of our student, who is among those selected for this prestigious honor,” said North Carolina A&T Chancellor Harold L. Martin Sr. “The outstanding academic work and commitment to high achievement are illustrative of the kind of students this program is attracting. I congratulate our scholar, Oluchi Chukwunyere, and her very impressive peers for their recognition, and look forward to the exciting work I know all of them will do over the coming year in exhibiting and championing HBCU excellence across the country.” Competitiveness Scholars typically assemble during the annual National HBCU Week Conference. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, scholars will not be able to convene in Washington, D.C., for the National Recognition Program in the fall. Instead, plans are underway for an online recognition and virtual campaign to ensure the scholars receive their acknowledgement during the 2020 Virtual HBCU Week Conference. During this virtual event , they will participate in workshops designed to strengthen their leadership and will be encouraged to seek out ongoing personal and professional development in the areas of innovation and entrepreneurship.

The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act establishes the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF) and requires that at least 50% of that funding be allocated to students for emergency cash grants for expenses related to the disruption of campus operations due to coronavirus, including technology, course materials, food, health care, and child care. The interim final rule (IFR) will provide certainty for institutions of higher education regarding which students are eligible to receive this emergency funding. ""It's clear the CARES Act was written to help Americans recover from the coronavirus pandemic,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. ""U.S. taxpayers have long supported U.S. students pursuing higher education, and this rule simply ensures the continuity of that well-established policy. As I've said since the law passed, my first goal was to get these funds to eligible students in need as quickly as possible. Today's action helps erase any uncertainty some institutions have expressed and helps make sure we can support America's students facing the greatest needs. We have a responsibility to taxpayers to administer the CARES Act faithfully, and that's exactly what we're doing."" By aligning student eligibility requirements for emergency financial aid grants under the CARES Act with Title IV eligibility, which dictates which students can receive taxpayer-subsidized student loans or grants, foreign nationals and most other non-citizens would not be eligible, as well as those who: (1) are dual-enrolled in secondary school; (2) do not meet academic progress standards; (3) are in default on a federal student loan or owe any refund relating to a federal student grant; (4) are without a high school diploma, GED certification, or recognized equivalent or exception; or (5) are in programs that are not Title IV-eligible programs. The IFR is available to view here . The IFR will be published in the Federal Register on Monday, June 15 and will be open for public comment for 30 days."

More than 2,000 education leaders from across the country listened in as educators from Arizona, Connecticut, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, and North Carolina discussed how they established innovative virtual learning capabilities to serve students and teachers now and in the future. Secretary DeVos kicked off the call by welcoming participants and thanking them for their work to ensure learning continued for all students during the 2019-20 school year. Secretary DeVos also emphasized the importance of sharing best practices and learning from each other as education leaders work to rethink distance learning for students in their unique communities. “Since the outbreak of COVID-19, my team and I have focused on empowering those closest to students with the flexibilities and resources they need to meet their specific needs,” said Secretary DeVos. “While there are unique public health situations facing each community, it is critical that everyone continue preparing and adapting with eyes focused on building capacity for distance learning and ultimately safely reopening soon. While there is no one-size-fits-all solution for learning across communities, one thing everyone does have in common is a commitment to ensuring learning continues for all students—no matter where they live and no matter what kind of school they attend.” U.S. Assistant Secretary for Elementary and Secondary Education Frank Brogan gave brief remarks to highlight the importance of distance learning as the country reopens following the pandemic. He then moderated the discussion on the following topics: Best practices for establishing clear lines of communication with students and parents during distance learning, including the use of videoconference technologies The importance of information sharing on distance learning experiences between schools in a district How to execute on innovative distance learning activities for students such as virtual field trips How local school districts overcame challenges over the last few months, including transitioning to online learning, solving internet connectivity issues, providing meals to students, and administering tests remotely How to better equip teachers with the knowledge and training needed for successful distance learning instruction Attendees to the discussion included K-12 superintendents, teachers, learning coaches, resource teachers, chief state school officers, and virtual curriculum developers representing traditional public, charter, private, independent and virtual schools across the country.

The competition, authorized by the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), will allow school districts to combine eligible federal funds with state and local funds in order to allocate resources based on students’ individual needs. “This is a great opportunity for local education leaders to rethink education funding in a way that puts students and their needs at the center of the decision-making process,” said Secretary DeVos. “This clear and quantifiable way to allocate education funding provides much-needed transparency, predictability, and autonomy at the local level, and helps to ensure the money follows students who need the most support.” Inflexible rules guiding the allocation and use of federal funds make it difficult for school districts to create student-centered funding systems using federal, state, and local funds. These grants will not only provide local districts with the flexibility they need to better serve students but also will provide the financial support they need to get the new system up and running. School districts that receive the grants will apply for and, if approved, implement the associated funding flexibility under Section 1501 of ESSA, which must include using weights that allocate substantially more funding to students from low-income families, English learners, and any other educationally disadvantaged student group identified by the school district. School districts must also consult parents, teachers, school leaders, and other relevant stakeholders as they develop and implement the student-centered funding system.

This award recognizes Ms. Woods, of Canyon Springs High School in Moreno Valley, California, and Ms. Four Bear, of New Town Middle School in New Town, North Dakota, for instilling in their students the skills, knowledge, and passion for cybersecurity. The Department received 43 nominations from 23 states, and the honorees were selected based on their demonstration of superior educator accomplishment, academic achievement indicators, and leadership contributing to educational excellence. ""I am pleased to congratulate Donna Woods and Kara Four Bear, the inaugural class of Presidential Cybersecurity Education Award honorees,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""Cybersecurity is one of the fastest growing fields in the world. This award recognizes great teachers who are helping prepare our students to fill those jobs and help keep our nation safe now and in the future."" As principal of New Town Middle School, Ms. Four Bear spearheaded the adoption of North Dakota cybersecurity education initiatives that teach digital literacy and safety skills to students of all ages. Under her leadership, educators at New Town Middle School make real-world connections to cybersecurity in the classroom so that students at this Title I school learn about career paths in this field. She has expanded opportunities for students to explore cybersecurity beyond the classroom through the Valley City State University Summer Academy and participation in the University of North Dakota NASA Near Space Project. Ms. Woods has fostered pathways to success for students by guiding the creation of career and technical education programs with emphasis on cybersecurity, which include real-world training such as internships and apprenticeships alongside classroom instruction. Throughout Ms. Woods' five years in the Moreno Valley Unified School District's Cyber Academic Pathway, 97.4% of students have achieved industry certifications. Her students have gone on to put their cybersecurity skills to work as network analysts, systems engineers, IT network specialists, and more. She has also led award-winning CyberPatriot teams, which compete in challenges to secure virtual networks. As part of this commendation, Woods and Four Bear will receive acknowledgement by President Donald J. Trump and Secretary DeVos, public recognition as leaders in the field of cybersecurity education, and professional development opportunities. This award was established on May 2, 2019, by President Trump's Executive Order on America's Cybersecurity Workforce. The U.S. Department of Education was charged to create this award within one year and in consultation with the Deputy Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism at the National Security Council and the National Science Foundation.

6-May-20,https://web.archive.org/web/20210108025343/https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/secretary-devos-takes-historic-action-strengthen-title-ix-protections-all-students,Secretary DeVos Takes Historic Action to Strengthen Title IX Protections for All Students,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos took historic action today to strengthen Title IX protections for survivors of sexual misconduct and to restore due process in campus proceedings to ensure all students can pursue an education free from sex discrimination. For the first time ever, the Department's Title IX regulations define sexual harassment, including sexual assault, as unlawful sex discrimination. The new Title IX regulation holds schools accountable for failure to respond equitably and promptly to sexual misconduct incidents and ensures a more reliable adjudication process that is fair to all students. The new regulation comes after years of wide-ranging research, careful deliberation, and critical input from survivors, advocates, falsely accused students, school administrators, Title IX coordinators, and the American people, including over 124,000 public comments. ""Too many students have lost access to their education because their school inadequately responded when a student filed a complaint of sexual harassment or sexual assault,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""This new regulation requires schools to act in meaningful ways to support survivors of sexual misconduct, without sacrificing important safeguards to ensure a fair and transparent process. We can and must continue to fight sexual misconduct in our nation's schools, and this rule makes certain that fight continues."" Since the beginning of her tenure, Secretary DeVos has worked to ensure all students have the freedom to learn in a safe environment, free from discrimination. The new Title IX regulation helps to achieve that goal by codifying prohibitions against sexual harassment in schools for the first time in history. The regulation carries the full force of law, unlike the previous administration's much-criticized ""Dear Colleague"" letter on the topic which denied students basic due process protections and led to cases frequently being overturned by the courts. With the benefit of robust public participation in the rulemaking process, this new Title IX regulation reflects Secretary DeVos' commitment to ensuring that every survivor's claim of sexual misconduct is taken seriously, and every person accused knows that guilt is not predetermined. Key provisions of the Department of Education's new Title IX regulation: Defines sexual harassment to include sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking, as unlawful discrimination on the basis of sex Provides a consistent, legally sound framework on which survivors, the accused, and schools can rely Requires schools to offer clear, accessible options for any person to report sexual harassment Empowers survivors to make decisions about how a school responds to incidents of sexual harassment Requires the school to offer survivors supportive measures, such as class or dorm reassignments or no-contact orders Protects K-12 students by requiring elementary and secondary schools to respond promptly when any school employee has notice of sexual harassment Holds colleges responsible for off-campus sexual harassment at houses owned or under the control of school-sanctioned fraternities and sororities Restores fairness on college and university campuses by upholding all students' right to written notice of allegations, the right to an advisor, and the right to submit, cross-examine, and challenge evidence at a live hearing Shields survivors from having to come face-to-face with the accused during a hearing and from answering questions posed personally by the accused Requires schools to select one of two standards of evidence, the preponderance of the evidence standard or the clear and convincing evidence standard – and to apply the selected standard evenly to proceedings for all students and employees, including faculty Provides ""rape shield"" protections and ensures survivors are not required to divulge any medical, psychological, or similar privileged records Requires schools to offer an equal right of appeal for both parties to a Title IX proceeding Gives schools flexibility to use technology to conduct Title IX investigations and hearings remotely Protects students and faculty by prohibiting schools from using Title IX in a manner that deprives students and faculty of rights guaranteed by the First Amendment Assistant Secretary Kenneth L. Marcus of the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) added, ""The new Title IX regulation is a game-changer. It establishes that schools and colleges must take sexual harassment seriously, while also ensuring a fair process for everyone involved. It marks the end of the false dichotomy of either protecting survivors, while ignoring due process, or protecting the accused, while disregarding sexual misconduct. There is no reason why educators cannot protect all of their students – and under this regulation there will be no excuses for failing to do so. In a string of recent major OCR Title IX cases, and in a large number of investigations over the last few years, we have shown that we will hold institutions accountable under federal civil rights laws. This regulation provides important new tools that will strengthen our ability to do so."" Today's action on Title IX is only one of many substantial ways Secretary DeVos has moved to protect survivors of sexual misconduct and all students. Under the Secretary's leadership, OCR has aggressively investigated schools that fail to protect students from sexual misconduct and to bring them into compliance with the law. The Secretary has required sweeping reforms to protect students, most notably at Michigan State University , Pennsylvania State University , the University of Southern California , and Chicago Public Schools . The Secretary's recently commenced initiative on sexual assault in K-12 schools enhances OCR's enforcement of Title IX in elementary and secondary schools and strengthens the responsibility of schools to respond to incidents of sexual misconduct. This major initiative also builds on the Department's work to implement the ""Pass the Trash"" provisions of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), which prohibits elementary and secondary school district administrators from shifting employees who sexually abuse students from school to school. Over the last three years, OCR has closed a total of 172 sexual violence cases with change, a 375% increase over the prior eight years in the annual number of sexual violence cases closed with change."

This funding is part of the Higher Education Emergency Relief (HEER) Fund authorized by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act , signed into law by President Donald J. Trump less than five weeks ago. ""This Administration is committed to the success of HBCUs, Minority Serving Institutions, and the students they serve. Each institution is unique and is an important part of this country's educational fabric,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""By providing additional support to these important institutions, we can help ensure they emerge from this crisis stronger than before. I encourage these institutions, like all others, to use these funds to provide emergency grants to students during this challenging time, and to expand remote learning programs and build IT capacity. These are challenging times, but if we take this opportunity to transform higher education to meet the demands of the 21st century, our nation's students and higher education as a whole will be better for it."" Institutions may use this funding to cover the cost of technology associated with a transition to distance education, grants to cover the costs of attendance for eligible students, and faculty and staff trainings. Additionally, funds may be used to cover operational costs, such as lost revenue, reimbursements for prior expenses, and payroll. These additional funding allocations to MSIs, including HBCUs and TCCUs, and institutions eligible for the Strengthening Institutions Program (SIP) represent 7.5 percent of overall HEER funds, or around $1 billion. This funding is provided on top of the primary HEER Fund allocation announced earlier in April. HBCUs, for example, will collectively receive an additional $577 million through the awards announced today. That amount is on top of the $353 million amount that the Department allocated to HBCUs through the HEER Fund earlier in the month. TCCUs will receive over $50 million in this round of HEER funding, bringing the total allocation to TCCUs under the fund to $65 million. The HEER Fund also sets aside 2.5 percent of the HEER Fund ($349 million) to address the greatest unmet needs related to the coronavirus, giving priority to schools that have not been allocated at least $500,000 from the fund. The Department is deploying these funds to ensure that every eligible public and private nonprofit institution will receive at least $500,000 in CARES Act relief funding. In order to access these funds, eligible institutions must sign a Certification and Agreement certifying that they will use their allocations in accordance with the CARES Act and all other applicable federal law. Schools have until Aug. 1, 2020, to apply for the funds. The Certification and Agreement, a cover letter, and the HEER Fund allocation tables by institution are available on the Office of Postsecondary Education's CARES Act website . The Department has taken quick action to support higher education students from the start of the coronavirus outbreak. Colleges and universities were given immediate regulatory flexibility so students' educations could continue online. Under the leadership of President Trump, the Department also provided student loan relief to tens of millions of borrowers by setting all federally held student loan interest rates to zero percent and allowing borrowers to defer payments for 60 days without interest. The CARES Act extends those benefits to six months. The Department also stopped all federal wage garnishments and collections actions for borrowers with federally held loans in default. Additionally, the Department made $6.2 billion available for emergency cash grants for higher education students, followed by $6.2 billion allocated to higher education institutions to ensure learning continues. The Department also disbursed $7 million to Gallaudet University and $13 million to Howard University in accordance with the CARES Act, which allocated this funding to help these unique institutions address the challenges associated with the coronavirus. The Department continues to update www.ed.gov/coronavirus with information on COVID-19 for students, parents, educators and local leaders.

As a result, the Secretary is not recommending Congress pass any additional waiver authority concerning the Free Appropriate Public Education (FAPE) and Least Restrictive Environment (LRE) requirements of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), reiterating that learning must continue for all students during the COVID-19 national emergency. As requested by Congress in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act , Secretary DeVos examined certain federal education laws to determine what, if any, additional waiver authority the Secretary believes is necessary to provide limited flexibility to state and local education agencies during this unprecedented time. The Secretary determined there is no reason that a student's access to FAPE cannot continue online, through distance education or other alternative strategies. ""We undertook this task acknowledging the reality that most students and teachers are at home today; yet, America's teachers want to keep teaching and students need to keep learning,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""While the Department has provided extensive flexibility to help schools transition, there is no reason for Congress to waive any provision designed to keep students learning. With ingenuity, innovation, and grit, I know this nation's educators and schools can continue to faithfully educate every one of its students."" As the Department reviewed applicable federal law, it did so with these core principles in mind: The health and safety of America's students, teachers, parents, and administrators is a top priority. Learning must continue for all students. Decision-making must be based on what is best for students, not the ""system."" Parents must be informed about the impact waivers will have on their children's education and consent to those changes. Services typically or historically provided in person must naturally occur differently. While not advising any waivers to the core tenets of IDEA, the Department is requesting that Congress consider additional flexibilities on administrative requirements under the Perkins Act, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the IDEA. The Secretary requested that Congress defer the work or repayment requirements or allow credit to be given for the service obligation for recipients of IDEA personnel preparation grants (personnel development scholarships) if employment was interrupted by COVID-19. Regarding the Perkins Act, the Secretary is also recommending a waiver that would allow local education agencies (LEAs) to keep any funds allotted to them for the 2019-2020 academic year that they have not spent during the COVID-19 national emergency. Without this waiver, LEAs would otherwise lose this money and have to return it to the state. The Secretary also requested Congress to permit Vocational Rehabilitation funds to be used to replace expired or spoiled food products at Randolph-Sheppard vending sites required to close due to COVID-19, thus providing support to vendors and allowing facilities to reopen more efficiently following the COVID-19 pandemic. The Secretary recommended several additional waiver authorities relating to the Perkins Act, the Adult Education and Family Literacy Act, the IDEA, and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.

The grants will be funded through the Education Stabilization Fund (ESF), authorized by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act , signed into law by President Donald J. Trump. ""If our ability to educate is limited to what takes place in any given physical building, we are never going to meet the unique needs of every student,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""The current disruption to the normal model is reaffirming something I have said for years: we must rethink education to better match the realities of the 21st century. This is the time for local education leaders to unleash their creativity and ingenuity, and I'm looking forward to seeing what they do to provide education freedom and economic opportunity for America's students."" The CARES Act provides $307.5 million for these discretionary grants, which the Department will divide between two competitions: $180 million for the Rethink K-12 Education Models Grant and $127.5 million for the Reimagining Workforce Preparation Grant. The Rethink K-12 Education Models Grant is aimed at opening new, innovative ways for students to access K-12 education with an emphasis on meeting students' needs during the coronavirus national emergency. The competition is open to state educational agencies which can apply for funds in one of the three categories: Microgrants for families, so that states can ensure they have access to the technology and educational services they need to advance their learning Statewide virtual learning and course access programs, so that students will always be able to access a full range of subjects, even those not taught in the traditional or assigned setting New, field-initiated models for providing remote education not yet imagined, to ensure that every child is learning and preparing for successful careers and lives The full Notice Inviting Applications (NIA) will be available online today. The Reimagining Workforce Preparation Grants are designed to expand short-term postsecondary programs and work-based learning programs in order to get Americans back to work and help small businesses return to being our country's engines for economic growth. The full NIA for this competition will be issued later this week. Secretary DeVos continued, ""Current students and displaced workers will be navigating a very different job market and economy once America reopens. This competition is a tremendous opportunity for states to think creatively and strategically about what their workforce needs will be and how to support entrepreneurs and small business in order to get the economic engines in their states firing on all cylinders again."" Application packages for these competitions will be available within two weeks. Applicants will then have 60 days to apply. As with most of the Department of Education's discretionary grant competitions, applications will be evaluated by a panel of independent peer reviewers, and the highest-scoring applications will be funded.

Part of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), the Innovative Assessment Demonstration Authority (IADA) program is designed to encourage local involvement in the development of the next generation of student assessments. ""This important pilot program provides states the opportunity to rethink assessing student achievement in ways that are more relevant to what they are learning,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""I look forward to seeing this program's impact on student achievement as more states, like Massachusetts, take the bold step to do things differently to better serve students."" As part of the program, states can pilot new and innovative assessments on a small scale, avoid double-testing students on both pilot and statewide exams, and develop strategies for implementing such innovative assessments statewide over time. The objective of Massachusetts' new innovative science assessment is to build a new form of assessment incorporating technology-enhanced performance tasks that are more engaging for students and signal the state's focus on deeper learning in classrooms. Under the IADA, the state will develop new science assessments for Grades 5 and 8, combining a streamlined version of the current state science assessment with interactive, engaging, and authentic science performance tasks. To participate in the pilot, states must apply and demonstrate how their innovative assessments are developed in collaboration with local stakeholders, aligned to challenging state academic standards and accessible to all students through use of principles of universal design for learning, among other requirements. Massachusetts joins four other states that were already granted IADA flexibility: Georgia and North Carolina in 2019, and Louisiana and New Hampshire in 2018."

This action expands on the Trump Administration's commitment to offer incarcerated individuals a second chance upon their re-entry to society, helping to reduce rates of recidivism. ""I've had the pleasure of visiting several Second Chance Pell institutions and have seen firsthand the transformative impact this experiment has on the lives of individuals who are incarcerated,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""By expanding this experiment, we are providing a meaningful opportunity for more students to set themselves up for future success in the workforce. The stories I've heard from students and institutions engaged in the experiment are very encouraging, and we look forward to seeing how this expansion will help even more students achieve a better future."" The expansion announced today more than doubles the size of the experiment, allowing incarcerated students to use Federal Pell Grants at 130 schools located in 42 states and the District of Columbia. Prior to today's announcement, there were 63 schools located in 26 states participating in this experiment. After receiving more than 180 letters of interest from colleges and universities, the Department selected the 67 new institutions to participate in the second cohort of the Second Chance Pell Experiment. These institutions were determined to be the most qualified; their selection ensures institutional, programmatic, and geographic diversity among new participants. Nearly two-thirds of the schools invited to participate today are two-year institutions, one-third are minority-serving institutions, and all are either public institutions or private nonprofits. Eight schools plan to deliver instruction through innovative and distance delivery methods, and 18 other schools proposed hybrid models of instruction. The Second Chance Pell Experiment, originally created in 2015, provides need-based Federal Pell Grants to individuals incarcerated in federal and state prisons. The grants allow incarcerated individuals to receive Federal funding to enroll in postsecondary programs offered by local colleges and universities or distance learning providers. In the first two years of the experiment, institutions were awarded approximately $36.2 million in Federal Pell Grants. According to Federal Student Aid records, nearly 5,000 incarcerated students received Federal Pell Grants in the 2016–17 award year, and 6,750 incarcerated students received Federal Pell Grants in the 2017–2018 award years. And according to a recent study by the Vera Institute of Justice, more than 4,000 credentials—including postsecondary certificates, associate degrees, and bachelor's degrees—have been awarded to Second Chance Pell students over the past three years. Additionally, according to the Rand Corporation , individuals who participate in correctional education programs are 43% less likely to return to prison than those who do not. About the Experimental Sites Initiative The Experimental Sites Initiative (ESI) is a limited waiver authority provided under the Higher Education Act (HEA) to evaluate new policy ideas for potential broader applicability. Under the ESI, the Secretary has authority to grant waivers of certain federal student aid program statutory or regulatory requirements to allow a limited number of institutions to participate in experiments to test alternative methods of administering the federal student aid programs.

This funding is allocated by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which was signed by President Donald J. Trump less than a month ago. Education leaders will have the flexibility to use funds from the Elementary and Secondary School Education Relief Fund (ESSER Fund) for immediate needs, such as tools and resources for distance education, ensuring student health and safety, and developing and implementing plans for the next school year. ""This national emergency continues to shine a light on the need for all schools to be more agile,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""Now is the time to truly rethink education and to get creative about how we meet each student's unique needs. The funding made available today has very few bureaucratic strings attached and empowers local education leaders to do just that. I encourage them to focus on investing in the technology, distance learning resources, training and long-term planning that will help education continue for both teachers and students, no matter where learning takes place."" Local leaders are empowered with the flexibility to determine how to use their ESSER funds, as long as they are used in ways that comply with applicable federal education laws. The ESSER Fund has important safeguards in place to ensure that this funding goes to help students continue learning. State education agencies (SEAs) must allocate 90% of their ESSER funds to local education agencies (LEAs), including public charter schools, in proportion to the amount of FY 2019 funds the LEA received under Title I, Part A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Up to 10% of the SEA's award may be retained for the state agency to use to address needs related to responding to coronavirus. After one year, SEAs must return any funds that have not been awarded, and the Secretary will reallocate those funds to the states. To see state allocations for the ESSER Fund, click here . The Department implemented a streamlined process for states to apply for and receive this critical funding by cutting red tape and removing unnecessary delays. SEAs have until July 1, 2020, to apply for ESSER funds by submitting a simple signed Certification and Agreement form to ESSERF@ed.gov . The Department intends to process each submitted form within three business days of receipt. For more information, click here . The funding allocations announced today are part of the nearly $31 billion Congress allocated to the Department to distribute to students, K-12 schools, and higher education institutions. The Department, at the Secretary's urging, has continued to make funds available as quickly as possible. Today's action follows the Department's earlier announcement of a turnkey waiver process allowing states to cancel federally mandated standardized testing in response to widespread school closures in the wake of the declaration of a national emergency. The Department also developed a streamlined process for providing states with funding flexibilities so that they can repurpose existing K-12 education funds for technology infrastructure and teacher training on remote learning and to move resources to areas of highest need. The Department also moved quickly to provide guidance on ensuring students with disabilities have access to distance learning opportunities and to provide an extension for states that need additional time to develop career and technical education plans under the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act (Perkins V). The Department continues to update ed.gov/coronavirus with information on COVID-19 for students, parents, educators and local leaders.

We cannot continue to excuse this problem away. Instead, we need to fundamentally rethink education in America. It is the only way our nation's students will be in a position to lead our nation and the world. ""The results are stark and inexcusable. A quarter or more of America's 8th graders are what NAEP defines as 'below basic' in U.S. history, civics and geography. In the real world, this means students don't know what the Lincoln-Douglas debates were about, nor can they discuss the significance of the Bill of Rights, or point out basic locations on a map. And only 15% of them have a reasonable knowledge of U.S. history. All Americans should take a moment to think about the concerning implications for the future of our country."""

But as I've said all along, wealthy institutions that do not primarily serve low-income students do not need or deserve additional taxpayer funds. This is common sense. Schools with large endowments should not apply for funds so more can be given to students who need support the most. It's also important for Congress to change the law to make sure no more taxpayer funds go to elite, wealthy institutions."" In her letter to college and university presidents on April 9, 2020, Secretary DeVos advised them, ""If you determine that your institution's students do not have significant financial need at this time, I would ask that you consider giving your allocation to those institutions within your state or region that might have significant need.""

The funding is available through the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund authorized by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act , signed into law by President Donald J. Trump less than one month ago. ""This pandemic has made clear every single education institution should make important investments to ensure learning continues when unexpected circumstances arise,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""Accordingly, the additional funds made available today can be used to expand remote learning programs, build IT capacity, and train faculty and staff to operate in a remote learning environment so that at any moment institutions can pivot quickly. I hope that institutions that already have robust remote learning capacity will consider using this funding to support additional emergency cash grants for students."" The CARES Act allows institutions to use up to one half of the total funds received to cover any costs associated with significant changes to the delivery of instruction due to the coronavirus. The funding for these ""Recipient Institutional Costs"" is separate from the funding previously made available for ""Emergency Financial Aid Grants to Students."" In order to access the funds, higher education institutions must submit a Certification and Agreement for Recipient Institutional Costs, which can be found here . Institutions must also have executed the Certification and Agreement for Emergency Financial Aid Grants to Students before submitting the second certification and agreement. So far, about 50% of eligible postsecondary institutions have applied to receive the Emergency Financial Aid Grants to Students. School allocations are set by a formula prescribed in the CARES Act, which is weighted significantly by the number of full-time students who are Pell-eligible but also takes into consideration the total population of the school and the number of students who were not enrolled full-time online before the coronavirus outbreak. The Department is utilizing the most recent data available from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) and Federal Student Aid (FSA) for this calculation. The funding allocations announced today are part of the nearly $31 billion Congress allocated to the Department to distribute to students, K-12 schools, and higher education institutions under the CARES Act. The Department, at the Secretary's urging, is working to make funds available as quickly as possible. The Department has taken quick action to support higher education students from the start of the coronavirus outbreak. Colleges and universities were given immediate regulatory flexibility so students' educations could continue online. Under the leadership of President Trump, the Department also provided student loan relief to tens of millions of borrowers by setting all federally held student loan interest rates to zero percent and allowing borrowers to defer payments for 60 days without interest. The CARES Act extends those benefits to six months. The Department also stopped all federal wage garnishments and collections actions for borrowers with federally held loans in default. And, within 13 days of President Trump signing the CARES Act into law, the Department made $6.2 billion available for emergency cash grants for higher education students. The Department has also disbursed $7 million to Gallaudet University and $13 million to Howard University in accordance with the CARES Act, which allocated this funding to help these unique institutions address the challenges associated with coronavirus. The Department continues to update ed.gov/coronavirus with information for students, parents, educators and local leaders about how to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Under the proposal, teachers would be empowered, through stipends or vouchers, to select and access professional development courses and opportunities that are relevant to their personal needs or career goals instead of having one-size-fits all programming dictated to them by the state or local education agency. ""I've spoken with hundreds of teachers across the country who love teaching yet share the same frustration: their professional development courses don't meet their needs, and they don't help them serve students,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""That's why I believe we must treat teachers like the valued professionals they are and empower them to seek out the professional learning opportunities that support their goals and aspirations. If we can trust teachers with our children each day, we should trust them to select the right continuing education courses."" The Education Innovation and Research (EIR) program, authorized by the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, as amended by the Every Student Succeeds Act, was created to explore ways to improve academic achievement for high-need students. The proposed priorities for EIR funding announced today will help the Department explore whether personalized professional development has a positive effect on instructional practice, and in turn, a positive effect on student achievement. The Department seeks feedback from the public about this Notice of Proposed Priorities, which is posted to the Federal Register . The comment period is open until May 13, 2020. During FY19, over $120 million in new grant awards were made to states, school districts and nonprofit organizations to help spur new innovations in education."

The Governor's Emergency Education Relief (GEER) Fund, authorized by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act , is an extraordinarily flexible ""emergency block grant"" designed to enable governors to decide how best to meet the needs of students, schools (including charter schools and non-public schools), postsecondary institutions, and other education-related organizations. ""Governors have the opportunity to truly rethink and transform the approach to education during this national emergency and ensure learning continues,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""At a time when so many school boards and superintendents have shut down learning for the balance of the school year, I want to encourage each and every governor to focus on continuity of education for all students. Parents, families, teachers and other local education leaders are depending on their leadership to ensure students don't fall behind."" In an effort to get these emergency funds to states as quickly as possible, the Department has streamlined the application process and reduced the red tape and delays typically associated with the award of federal grant funds; all that is required is the completion of a brief application, which can be digitally signed and submitted in PDF to the email address GEERF@ed.gov . The application, including instructions to apply, is available on the Department's website at https://oese.ed.gov/offices/education-stabilization-fund/governors-emergency-education-relief-fund/ . Once states have submitted the signed PDF, the Department expects to obligate the funds within three business days. To see state allocations for the GEER Fund click here .

This new flexibility guidance comes in response to a desire from state and local educators to donate their unused equipment during the COVID-19 National Emergency. ""We are all fighting coronavirus together, and each of us is looking for ways we can contribute to defeating this invisible enemy,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""After hearing from educators about their desire to contribute to this fight, it was a no-brainer to cut through the red tape and provide them the flexibility needed to donate valuable medical equipment to our brave medical professionals on the front lines."" Many CTE programs purchase PPE and other supplies and equipment through funds awarded by federal grants for use in hands-on learning opportunities in various medical fields of study. Examples of equipment currently not needed for learning activities that can be donated or loaned under the new flexibility offered by the Department include gloves, masks, face shields, gowns, ventilators, and three-dimensional printers.

Through the Expanding Opportunity through Quality Charter Schools Program (Charter Schools Program, or CSP), more students will have the opportunity to move off waitlists into schools of their choice. ""There are hundreds of thousands of kids on charter school wait lists across America, hoping for the opportunity to access an education that will help them reach their full potential,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""These critical investments in high-quality charter schools will help make that dream a reality for more students. The current educational disruptions are making crystal clear that students need more options and more flexibility to help find their right fit and shape their future success. The investments we are making today are truly investments in our nation's future."" The Charter Schools Program awards grants competitively to the highest quality proposals, as evaluated by independent peer reviewers. This year's competition awarded funds to 13 different Charter Management Organizations (CMOs) which propose to replicate or expand over 100 high-quality public charter schools in eight states over the next several years. Over 95% of the funding will go towards public charter schools in Qualified Opportunity Zones. Currently, more than 70% of Opportunity Zones lack a public charter school option for families. By creating and expanding high-quality public charter schools in Opportunity Zones, more families living in economically distressed communities will have the freedom to choose the educational option that's best suited to their child's needs.

The funding is available through the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund authorized by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act , signed into law by President Donald J. Trump less than two weeks ago. ""What's best for students is at the center of every decision we make,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""That's why we prioritized getting funding out the door quickly to college students who need it most. We don't want unmet financial needs due to the coronavirus to derail their learning."" The CARES Act provides nearly $14 billion to support postsecondary education students and institutions. Colleges and universities are required to utilize the $6.28 billion made available today to provide cash grants to students for expenses related to disruptions to their educations due to the COVID-19 outbreak, including things like course materials and technology as well as food, housing, health care, and childcare. In order to access the funds, the Department must receive a signed certification from the higher education institution affirming they will distribute the funds in accordance with applicable law. The college or university will then determine which students will receive the cash grants. School allocations are set by formula prescribed in the CARES Act that is weighted significantly by the number of full-time students who are Pell-eligible but also takes into consideration the total population of the school and the number of students who were not enrolled full-time online before the coronavirus outbreak. The Department is utilizing the most recent data available from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) and Federal Student Aid (FSA) for this calculation. Institutions will receive allocations and guidance for the institutional share of the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund in the coming weeks. Institutions will be able to use these funds to cover costs associated with significant changes to the delivery of instruction due to the coronavirus. Additional information on institution-level funding for students, including data tables, can be found here .

The new flexibilities, authorized under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, allow schools to repurpose existing K-12 education funds for technology infrastructure and teacher training on distance learning, among other flexibilities to move resources to areas of highest need during the national emergency. ""Across the country, students, teachers and families are proving that learning can and does happen anywhere,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""By extending additional funding flexibility to schools, we are helping to ensure student learning continues and supporting teachers as they transition to virtual classrooms. Local leaders have asked for the ability to steer more resources to local needs, and these new tools will help them do just that."" The CARES Act, signed into law by President Donald J. Trump on March 27, now allows states and school districts to devote more of their federal resources to technology infrastructure to support distance learning for students and for professional development for teachers who are teaching remotely, many for the first time. By providing a streamlined process to obtain funding flexibilities, states will be able to quickly make decisions to meet the needs of their students. Any state may complete a brief form available at oese.ed.gov , and it will receive an initial determination within one business day. Using the form, states can receive flexibility in the use of funds and other requirements covered under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA), including the Title I, Parts A-D, Title II, Title III, Part A, Title IV, Parts A-B, and Title V programs. Specifically, states may request a waiver of: Section 1127(b) of Title I, Part A of the ESEA to waive the 15% carryover limitation for Title I, Part A funds; Section 421(b) of the General Education Provisions Act (GEPA) to extend the period of availability of prior fiscal year funds, for Title I, Parts A-D, Title II, Title III, Part A, Title IV, Parts A-B, and Title V, Part B programs, and the McKinney-Vento Homeless Children and Youth program; Section 4106(d) of Title IV, Part A of the ESEA to waive a needs assessment to justify the use of funds; Section 4106(e)(2)(C), (D), and (E) of Title IV, Part A of the ESEA to waive content-specific spending requirements; Section 4109(b) of Title IV, Part A of the ESEA to waive spending restrictions on technology infrastructure; and Section 8101(42) of the ESEA to waive the definition of ""professional development,"" which might otherwise limit the ability to quickly train school leaders and teachers on topics like effective distance learning techniques. This action follows the Department's earlier announcement of a turnkey waiver process allowing states to cancel federally-mandated standardized testing, in response to widespread school closures in the wake of the declaration of a national emergency. Since that announcement, Secretary DeVos has approved waivers for all 50 states and the District of Columbia. It further builds on the Department's actions to support states and local education leaders since the outbreak of COVID-19, including guidance on ensuring students with disabilities have access to distance learning opportunities and providing an extension for states that need additional time to develop career and technical education plans under the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act (Perkins V).

Although work on the proposed Distance Learning and Innovation regulation started more than a year ago, the COVID-19 National Emergency underscores the need for reform and for all educational institutions to have a robust capacity to teach remotely. ""With our support, colleges and universities were among the first to transition to online and distance learning so learning could continue during the coronavirus pandemic,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""Frankly, though, they are working within the confines of stale rules and regulations that are in desperate need of rethinking. We know there are fewer and fewer ‘traditional' students in higher education, and this current crisis has made crystal clear the need for more innovation. It's past time we rethink higher ed to meet the needs of all students. Fortunately, we started work last year to develop a new set of standards that are responsive to current realities, that embrace new technology, that open doors for much-needed innovation in higher education, and that expand access for students to the flexible, relevant education opportunities they need."" Crafted by a diverse group of experts during the Department's 2019 negotiated rulemaking, the Department's proposed Distance Learning and Innovation regulations enhance educational quality and reduce barriers to innovation while maintaining safeguards to limit the risks to students and taxpayers. These proposed regulations build upon Secretary DeVos' call for institutions, educators, and policy makers to ""rethink higher education"" and find new ways to expand educational opportunity, demonstrate the value of a postsecondary credential and lifelong learning, and reduce costs for students and schools. The proposed regulation would do the following: Emphasize demonstrated learning over seat time. Remove confusion over whether a course is eligible for Title IV aid by defining ""regular and substantive"" interaction between students and instructors. Clarify and simplify the requirements for direct assessment programs, including how to determine equivalent credit hours. Add a definition of ""juvenile justice facility"" to ensure that incarcerated students remain Pell eligible. Allow students enrolled in Title IV, Higher Education Act (HEA)-eligible foreign institutions to complete up to 25% of their programs at an eligible institution in the United States. This provision is particularly important for students temporarily unable to attend courses abroad due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Encourage employer participation in developing educational programs. Create a new, student-centric system for disbursing Title IV, HEA assistance to students in subscription-based programs. Require prompt action by the Department on applications to participate, or continue to participate, as an eligible institution in the HEA, Title IV program. In the past, these applications have been stalled for months or even years. The proposed Distance Learning and Innovation rule was the result of a months-long negotiated rulemaking effort that began with public hearings and engaged a subcommittee of subject matter experts to formulate recommendations that were ultimately considered by a panel of representatives from the higher education and consumer protection communities. Negotiators reached consensus on the language included in this proposed rule, which strikes a balance between fostering innovation and protecting students and taxpayers from waste, fraud, and abuse. The Department will publish the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the Federal Register for a 30-day public comment period. Following the comment period, the Department will publish a final regulation prior to Nov. 1, 2020."

Following up on feedback she received from town hall meetings between the Department and state CTE directors, the Secretary has decided to use transition authority to provide an extension for states that need additional time to submit their Perkins V state plans, allow states and local Perkins recipients to receive their first installment of Perkins V funds on time—even if they need an extension, and allow states to provide funding recipients additional time to complete their applications. “The 12 million students in career and technical education programs today are tomorrow’s first responders, nurses, and medical assistants—those who are right now on the front lines of the fight against the coronavirus,” said Secretary DeVos. “They are also those who will help rebuild and grow our economy. This Administration’s commitment to CTE programs is unwavering, and the flexibilities provided today will help to ensure their critical work continues.” Information on the new flexibilities was provided to local leaders through a new Q&A document which can be found here . Perkins V plans allow state and local education agencies and institutions of higher education to receive federal support for CTE programs that develop more fully the academic, technical, and employability skills of secondary and postsecondary students. These programs are designed to expand opportunities for every student to explore, choose, and follow career pathways to earn credentials of value.

The Secretary began the call by welcoming the participants, including state higher education executive officers, college and university presidents, accreditors, and leaders of national higher education organizations, and thanking them for their continued work on behalf of students. The Secretary then briefed the group on the Department’s quick action to provide regulatory flexibility so that colleges and universities could move classes online to limit disruptions to student learning and prevent the spread of COVID-19. She also discussed the increased, temporary flexibilities given to accreditors so that they could provide short-term approval for distance learning programs and courses, conduct virtual site visits, and extend accreditation terms or provide good cause extensions during this national emergency. She then turned the call over to Chief Operating Officer Mark Brown of the office of Federal Student Aid who briefed participants on the immediate action the Department took to provide student loan relief to borrowers including setting student loan interest rates to 0%, suspending student loan payments, and stopping wage garnishments. He also discussed the six-month extension to those actions provided by the recently enacted Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security ( CARES) Act. Assistant Secretary Scott Stump of the Office for Career, Technical, and Adult Education discussed new flexibilities announced for Perkins V plan submission deadlines for community and technical colleges as they apply for federal support for career and technical education programs.

The prior administration failed to resolve the investigation, which opened in early 2014. ""As I've said before, ‘justice delayed is justice denied,' and for too long the students of Penn State have been denied justice,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""I committed to clearing out the backlog of cases we inherited from the previous administration, and we are doing just that. I hope resolution of this Title IX investigation and the changes we are requiring will help to bring continued healing to the Penn State community."" With the conclusion of this investigation, OCR is holding Penn State accountable for its failures to have systems in place that protect students, including when sexual misconduct involves athletic staff. The University must now provide for individual remedies for survivors whose complaints OCR determined that Penn State failed to handle promptly and equitably, revise its recordkeeping practices to ensure proper documentation of sexual harassment complaints, and report to OCR on the handling of all Title IX complaints for the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 academic years. OCR reviewed University policies and procedures for resolving allegations of sexual harassment effective during the 2011-12 through the 2019-20 academic years. OCR focused its review on eight campuses: the University Park campus and the Altoona, Behrend (Erie), Berks, Harrisburg, Hazelton, Schuylkill, and Worthington Commonwealth campuses and conducted file reviews of complaints of sexual harassment. OCR found that the University violated Title IX in different ways across several years: During the 2016-2017 academic year for student complaints and the 2015-2016 and 2017-2018 academic years for complaints first reported to the Athletic Department, Penn State failed to appropriately respond to complaints of sexual harassment. During the 2016-17 academic year, the University failed to maintain records necessary for OCR to determine whether the University complied with Title IX. During the 2017-2018 through the 2019-2020 academic years, the University continued to fail to implement adequate record-keeping practices. During the 2019-20 academic year, the University's Title IX policies and procedures failed to provide adequate notice to students and employees of the procedures; to ensure fair and appropriate investigation of complaints; to provide procedures for complaints alleging discrimination based on sex carried out by employees and third parties; to provide designated and reasonably prompt timeframes for the major stages of the complaint process; and to provide notice to parties of the outcome of investigations of complaints. In addition to these violations, OCR also found that from 2017-2019 Penn State had imposed interim suspensions prior to providing the accused an opportunity to respond to allegations. From 2017-2019, the University also structured hearings in a way that may have precluded relevant information. As a result of the serious deficiencies unearthed by OCR's investigation, OCR and Penn State have entered into a Resolution Agreement that requires Penn State to take the following actions: Provide for individual remedies as appropriate for instances where it has not promptly and equitably processed complaints of sexual harassment. Report to OCR on its processing of sexual harassment complaints for the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 academic years. Review and revise its Title IX policies to ensure they provide for an appropriate response to complaints of sexual harassment. Revise its recordkeeping practices to ensure that it is adequately and accurately documenting all complaints of sexual harassment and the University's response to such complaints. Facilitate additional relevant Title IX training for University staff, including athletics staff. Notify participants in its youth programs and their parents and guardians that Title IX prohibits sexual harassment against youth participants. ""Given all of the attention that Penn State has faced in the wake of the Jerry Sandusky scandal, it is disappointing that so many serious problems have remained at that university system,"" said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Kenneth L. Marcus. ""As OCR has demonstrated, schools will be held responsible for how they respond to complaints of sexual harassment. We are pleased that Penn State has now agreed, in a spirit of cooperation, to fix the problems that we have identified. OCR will closely monitor the University to make sure that it fulfills the requirements of the Resolution Agreement."" Under the leadership of Secretary DeVos, OCR has moved aggressively to investigate schools that fail to protect students from sexual misconduct and to bring them into compliance with civil rights law. The Department has most notably required sweeping reforms to protect students at Michigan State University , Chicago Public Schools , and the University of Southern California . Over the last three years, OCR has closed a total of 172 sexual violence cases with change, a 375% increase over the prior eight years in the annual number of sexual violence cases closed with change. The Letter of Finding in the Pennsylvania State University case is available here . The Resolution Agreement is available here . OCR recognizes that many educational institutions are focused now on protecting the health, safety, and welfare of students and staff in response to COVID-19, while continuing to conduct their educational mission.

The Vice President and Secretary began the call with opening remarks and provided an update on the following topics: President Trump’s announcement that the Department is expediting the standardized testing waiver application process to accommodate states that are unable to facilitate federally required standardized testing during this academic year. As of today, 45 states have applied for a waiver and have been granted initial approval. The Department’s additional guidance regarding distance learning for students with disabilities. This new resource explains that as a school district takes necessary steps to address the health, safety, and well-being of all its students and staff, educators can use distance learning opportunities to serve all students. The administration’s actions to support student loan borrowers by setting student loan interest rates to 0% and allowing borrowers to opt-in to administrative forbearance for 60 days without penalty or accruing interest. Secretary DeVos has stopped all requests to the U.S. Treasury to withhold money from defaulted borrowers’ federal income tax refunds, Social Security payments, and other federal payments. The Department will also refund approximately $1.8 billion in offsets that have already occurred to more than 830,000 borrowers. Secretary DeVos encouraged participants on the call to think creatively about ways to ensure all students can continue learning during this time, and thanked everyone for their work on behalf students, teachers, and parents. Following their remarks, Secretary DeVos answered questions from participants about a wide range of topics including distance education, education for students with disabilities, internet accessibility, and funding flexibility to meet the needs of students and teachers. Participants Mike Pence, Vice President of the United States Betsy DeVos, U.S. Secretary of Education Mark Bane, president, Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America Thomas Burnford, president and CEO, National Catholic Educational Association Michael Casserly, executive director, Council of the Great City Schools Daniel Domenech, executive director, American Association of School Administrators Earl Franks, executive director National Association of Elementary School Principals Tom Gentzel, executive director and CEO, National School Boards Association David Lewis, executive director, Association of School Business Officials International Mike Magee, CEO, Chiefs for Change Carissa Miller, executive director, Council of Chief State School Officers Donna Orem, president, National Association of Independent Schools Stephen Parker, National Governors Association Nina Rees, president and CEO, National Alliance for Public Charter Schools Dr. Larry Taylor, Association of Christian Schools International Dave Wick, president, National Association of Elementary School Principals Rabbi David Zwiebel, executive vice president, Agudath Israel of America This call is part of the Department’s ongoing communications with K-12 stakeholders regarding the Administration’s education-related Coronavirus actions.

This flexibility will last for a period of at least 60 days from March 13, 2020. ""These are difficult times for many Americans, and we don't want to do anything that will make it harder for them to make ends meet or create additional stress,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""Americans counting on their tax refund or Social Security check to make ends meet during this national emergency should receive those funds, and our actions today will make sure they do."" At the Secretary's direction, the Department has stopped all requests to the U.S. Treasury to withhold money from defaulted borrowers' federal income tax refunds, Social Security payments, and other federal payments. Such withholdings, known as ""Treasury offsets,"" are permitted by federal law and applied toward repayment of defaulted federal student loans. At the same time, the Secretary directed the Department to refund approximately $1.8 billion in offsets to more than 830,000 borrowers. The Department expects the number of borrowers who will benefit from this relief to increase as servicers work through additional offsets in the queue at the time of this announcement. The refunds represent offsets that were in the process of being withheld on March 13, 2020, the date President Donald J. Trump declared a national emergency and announced emergency executive actions related to COVID-19. Additionally, private collection agencies have been instructed to halt all proactive collection activities, including making phone calls to borrowers and issuing collection letters and billing statements. The Department must rely on employers to make the change to borrowers' paychecks, so it will monitor employers' compliance with the request to stop wage garnishment. Borrowers whose wages continue to be garnished after March 13 should contact their employers' human resources department. Borrowers with defaulted student loans, a current relationship with a private collection agency, and an interest in continuing a prior payment arrangement, consolidating their loans, or beginning a loan rehabilitation arrangement with their private collection agency, should contact the Department's Default Resolution Group at 1-800-621-3115 (TTY for the deaf or hearing-impaired 1-877-825-9923). Private collection agencies are permitted to provide assistance upon the borrower's request. This new student loan relief for borrowers comes just days after President Donald J. Trump announced that borrowers with a federally held student loan will automatically have their interest rates set to 0% for a period of at least 60 days. In addition, these non-defaulted borrowers will have the option to suspend their payments for at least two months to allow them greater flexibility during the national emergency. This will allow borrowers to temporarily stop their payments without worrying about accruing interest. Visit StudentAid.gov/coronavirus for more information. The Department encourages borrowers to avoid paying for services the Department provides for free.

This new resource from the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) and the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS) explains that as a school district takes necessary steps to address the health, safety, and well-being of all its students and staff, educators can use distance learning opportunities to serve all students. ""It was extremely disappointing to hear that some school districts were using information from the Department of Education as an excuse not to educate kids,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""This is a time for creativity and an opportunity to pursue as much flexibility as possible so that learning continues. It is a time for all of us to pull together to do what's right for our nation's students."" ""Nothing issued by this Department should in any way prevent any school from offering educational programs through distance instruction,"" she continued. ""We need schools to educate all students out of principle, rather than educate no students out of fear. These are challenging times, but we expect schools to rise to the occasion, and the Department stands ready to assist you in your efforts."" As the fact sheet states, schools ""… should not opt to close or decline to provide distance instruction, at the expense of students, to address matters pertaining to services for students with disabilities. Rather, school systems must make local decisions that take into consideration the health, safety, and well-being of all their students and staff. To be clear: ensuring compliance with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (Section 504), and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act should not prevent any school from offering educational programs through distance instruction."" To help schools provide distance learning in compliance with federal law, this fact sheet explains: The Department recognizes that exceptional circumstances may affect how special education and related services and supports are provided to students with disabilities, and the Department will offer flexibility. School districts must provide a free and appropriate public education (FAPE) to students with disabilities, and the provision of FAPE may include, as appropriate, special education and related services that can be provided via computer, internet, or phone. Although online learning must be accessible to students with disabilities, federal law does not mandate the specific methodologies by which distance education must be provided. In instances where technology is not accessible or where educational materials are not available in an accessible format, educators may still meet their legal obligations by providing equally effective alternate access to the curriculum or services provided to other students. The Department will continue to work with state and local leaders to identify any additional areas where it can provide resources to support educators in their important work, and both OCR and OSERS are available to provide technical assistance during these uncertain times. The Department continues to update www.ed.gov/coronavirus with information for students, parents, educators, and local leaders about how to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Those who attended the call included representatives from the National Association of State Boards of Education, National Governors Association, Council of Chief State School Officers, and elected officials, among many others. During the discussion, subject matter experts answered questions about the process for approval of statewide testing waivers, meal delivery for students during school closures, lengths of school closures due to the outbreak, requirements for local education agencies to provide services to students with disabilities, and Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) requirements during the outbreak. U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos welcomed participants to the call, thanked them for working on behalf of our nation's students and teachers, and encouraged continued communication with the Department during the outbreak. Secretary DeVos also discussed today's announcements regarding relief from the requirement to test students under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), and student loan relief for tens of millions of federal student loan borrowers. Deputy Secretary Mitchell ""Mick"" Zais gave an overview of the Department of Education's COVID-19 working group, which he leads, and encouraged participants to frequently visit the Department's website, ed.gov/coronavirus , for updated materials. Assistant Secretary Frank Brogan of the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education briefed participants on the Department's letter on the subject, a webinar on ensuring web accessibility for students with disabilities for schools utilizing online learning during the pandemic, and a fact sheet on how to protect students' civil rights as school leaders take steps to keep students safe and secure. Acting Assistant Secretary Mark Schultz of the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services spoke about the Department's guidance on how to provide services to students with disabilities during school closures throughout the outbreak. He announced clarifying information would be forthcoming in response to questions about implementation. Information on single points of contact for technical assistance to SEAs on best practices and models of instruction, accessibility, and data, will also be provided. Acting Director Kala Surprenant of the Student Privacy Policy Office discussed the Department's guidance on the sharing of student education records during a health and safety emergency under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and identified resources on FERPA and virtual learning that will be available at https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/ . Representatives from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) also participated in the call: Nancy Messonnier from the CDC discussed what schools, parents and communities can do while schools are closed, as well as what strategies school administrators and staff should consider when they begin to think about reopening. Deputy Under Secretary Brandon Lipps from USDA addressed the Department's ongoing commitment to feeding low-income children when schools close. USDA intends to use all available program flexibilities and contingencies to serve program participants across their 15 nutrition programs, many of which were expanded by the recently enacted Families First Coronavirus Response Act. This call is part of the Department's ongoing communications with K-12 stakeholders regarding the Administration's education-related Coronavirus actions.

Upon a proper request, the Department will grant a waiver to any state that is unable to assess its students due to the ongoing national emergency, providing relief from federally mandated testing requirements for this school year. Secretary DeVos commented: ""Students need to be focused on staying healthy and continuing to learn. Teachers need to be able to focus on remote learning and other adaptations. Neither students nor teachers need to be focused on high-stakes tests during this difficult time. Students are simply too unlikely to be able to perform their best in this environment. Our actions today provide turnkey flexibilities for state and local leaders to focus on the immediate needs of their students and educators without worrying about federal repercussions. I've spoken with many local education leaders in the past days, and I'm inspired by their efforts to help their students continue to learn and grow. We're going to continue to provide every flexibility possible to help make that as simple as possible."" In response to the extraordinary public health threat posed by COVID-19, President Donald J. Trump declared a national emergency. As a result, many states have closed some or all schools. Therefore, a state unable to assess its students may seek a waiver from federal testing requirements by completing a form available at oese.ed.gov . At the Secretary's direction, the Department has dramatically streamlined the application process to make it as simple as possible for state leaders who are grappling with many complex issues. To protect students' health and safety, a state that deems it necessary should proceed with cancelling its statewide assessments for the 2019-2020 school year. Since student performance, as measured by assessments, is required to be used in statewide accountability systems, any state that receives a one-year waiver may also receive a waiver from the requirement that this testing data be used in the statewide accountability system due to the national emergency. The Department will continue to speak with state and local leaders to identify any additional needed flexibilities, and it remains in coordination with Congress on expanding the range of flexibilities available to the Department under law. The Department continues to update www.ed.gov/coronavirus with information for students, parents, educators and local leaders about how to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Trump's promise to provide student loan relief to tens of millions of borrowers during the COVID-19 national emergency. All borrowers with federally held student loans will automatically have their interest rates set to 0% for a period of at least 60 days. In addition, each of these borrowers will have the option to suspend their payments for at least two months to allow them greater flexibility during the national emergency. This will allow borrowers to temporarily stop their payments without worrying about accruing interest. ""These are anxious times, particularly for students and families whose educations, careers, and lives have been disrupted,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""Right now, everyone should be focused on staying safe and healthy, not worrying about their student loan balance growing. I commend President Trump for his quick action on this issue, and I hope it provides meaningful help and peace of mind to those in need."" Secretary DeVos has directed all federal student loan servicers to grant an administrative forbearance to any borrower with a federally held loan who requests one. The forbearance will be in effect for a period of at least 60 days, beginning on March 13, 2020. To request this forbearance, borrowers should contact their loan servicer online or by phone. The Secretary has also authorized an automatic suspension of payments for any borrower more than 31 days delinquent as of March 13, 2020, or who becomes more than 31 days delinquent, essentially giving borrowers a safety net during the national emergency. Some borrowers may want to continue making payments, like those seeking Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) or those enrolled in a repayment plan with a manageable monthly payment. For borrowers continuing to make payments, the full amount of their payment will be applied to the principal amount of their loan once all interest accrued prior to the president's March 13 announcement is paid. The Department will work closely with Congress to ensure all student borrowers, including those in income driven repayment plans, receive needed support during this emergency. Any borrower who has experienced a change in income can contact their loan servicer to discuss lowering their monthly payment. Visit StudentAid.gov/coronavirus for forthcoming details.

In addition, OCR published a fact sheet for education leaders on how to protect students' civil rights as school leaders take steps to keep students safe and secure. These resources will assist education leaders in making distance learning accessible to students with disabilities and in preventing discrimination during this Administration-wide response effort. As more schools across the nation shift to distance learning, OCR's webinar reminds decisionmakers of their responsibility in making distance learning accessible to students with disabilities, unless equally effective alternate access is provided. Online learning tools must be accessible to students with disabilities, and they must be compatible with the various forms of assistive technology that students might use to help them learn. The webinar advises school leaders to routinely test their online activities to ensure accessibility. ""OCR's accessibility webinar is intended to remind school leaders at the elementary, secondary, and postsecondary levels of their legal obligations to ensure that all students, including students with disabilities, can access online and virtual learning programs,"" said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Kenneth L. Marcus. ""Students with disabilities must have access to educational technology utilized by schools, and OCR will continue to work to ensure that no student is excluded from utilizing these important tools."" In addition, the new fact sheet released by OCR presents information on the rights of students with disabilities during school closures and includes tips for preventing incidents of discrimination. It also includes information on ensuring that no student is discriminated against based on race, color, or national origin. The document reminds schools of their legal obligation to comply with non-discrimination obligations under civil rights laws, including Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and provides tools to assist schools in facilitating distance learning for all students.

The Education Department also released important information for K-12 educators on flexibilities the Department could grant when it comes to the accountability standards required by law under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). The new guidance on student privacy provides clarity about the requirements of the Federal Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) as it pertains to the COVID-19 outbreak. For example, it advises school officials on working with public health officials to manage COVID-19-related issues while protecting the privacy of students' education records. In addition, the Department has posted a fact sheet for K-12 schools about their considerations related to assessments and accountability should a school be closed for an extended period. If a school is unable to meet certain benchmarks due to absenteeism or school closure, the Department would consider a targeted one-year waiver so that the participation rate or absenteeism metric would not be factored into the school's Academic Achievement indicator. In order to ensure that students with disabilities continue to receive the services guaranteed by IDEA and Section 504, the Department has published a Q&A document for state and local educational authorities. This information answers the most common questions schools have about when and how they must provide instruction, including when to consider use of online or virtual instruction and other curriculum-based instructional activities. ""We are working closely with our inter-agency partners to provide state and local leaders the information they need to ensure the health and safety of their students and educators,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""We will continue to work alongside them and provide them the flexibilities they need in order to best support their communities."" This communication is the latest step in the Department's ongoing effort to assist students, teachers, and education leaders as part of the Administration's unprecedented, whole-of-government response to the viral outbreak. It follows the earlier-released guidance to institutions of higher education and a letter on protecting civil rights in schools during this time of heightened concern. The CDC has issued interim guidance to help K-12 schools and childcare programs plan for and prevent the spread of COVID-19 among students and staff.

This innovative pilot will allow students at the participating schools to choose to receive their financial aid refunds—after expenses such as tuition, fees, and room and board are paid—on a prepaid card with a linked online account accessible through the myStudentAid mobile app. Traditionally, when students receive more federal student aid than is billed by their institution, they have been able to receive their remaining financial aid refund via direct deposit, check, or on a prepaid debit card. The my FSApay program pilot provides students with a convenient alternative. The my FSApay account either reimburses or does not charge fees for the most common types of transactions in stores and at ATMs. Students can use the account to pay for other educational expenses, like transportation, books, food, and supplies, and they can, for example, deposit checks from an employer or parent into the account and complete peer-to-peer payments. There is no cost for students or schools to participate in the pilot. The Department selected the four institutions, in part, based on the schools' participation in the federal student aid programs, large student body, and geographic location. Additional schools will be added throughout 2020. The pilot will be implemented initially by Fiserv and Metabank, which were selected based on the quality of their past performance in the campus card market, fit for the program, and technical capabilities. In its evaluation of the effectiveness of the pilot, the Department will receive aggregated data from Fiserv and Metabank, such as the percentage of students receiving financial aid refunds that sign up for and activate the card; data will not be provided until a substantial number of students are enrolled in order to protect their privacy. Additionally, the pilot implementers are not permitted to cross-market other services or share students' information with outside parties."

As a result of the systemic failures at USC, the Department is requiring the school to overhaul its Title IX processes, conduct a formal review of current and former employees to determine if they responded appropriately to notice of possible sex discrimination, and allow OCR to monitor its compliance for three years. ""This total and complete failure to protect students is heartbreaking and inexcusable,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""Too many at USC turned a blind eye to evidence that Dr. Tyndall was preying on students for years. We are grateful to every survivor who came forward to share their story with our OCR investigators. Because of your bravery, we can now work with the University to ensure this never happens to another student on USC's campus."" On May 24, 2018, OCR opened a directed investigation to determine USC's Title IX compliance regarding the conduct of Dr. George Tyndall. OCR investigated whether the University received notice of allegations of misconduct by Tyndall, whether the University failed to respond appropriately, and if so, whether the failure allowed any female student to be subject to continuing sex discrimination. OCR found that the University failed to respond appropriately to notice of possible misconduct by Dr. Tyndall and that the University's failure to respond appropriately may have allowed female students to be subjected to continuing sex discrimination. OCR also found that USC failed to maintain a recordkeeping system to identify and monitor incidents of possible sex discrimination by its employees. Specifically: USC had notice of possible misconduct by Tyndall of five patients from 2000 to 2009. It failed to investigate, assess whether interim measures were needed, determine whether the five patients were subjected to sex discrimination, or ensure that steps were taken to prevent recurrence of the conduct and correct its effects for patients who complained and/or other patients. It also had notice of possible mistreatment of four more patients by Dr. Tyndall, and it failed to respond appropriately. Patients and staff complained that during the course of conducting pelvic examinations, Dr. Tyndall made inappropriate remarks, often commenting on the physical attributes of patients' bodies. In 2016, USC failed to investigate complaints that Tyndall conducted pelvic examinations without gloves. That same year, the University failed to investigate complaints raised by chaperones and the Nurse Supervisor regarding Tyndall's digital penetration of patients during examinations and full-body skin checks. When in 2016 the University discovered over 200 photographs of patients' genitals in Dr. Tyndall's office, it failed to investigate whether the photographing of patients and the possession of the photographs constituted sex discrimination. In addition, the University failed to take reasonable steps to locate the remaining photographs that Tyndall admitted to taking from 1989 to 2010 and permitted him to continue seeing patients for a day and a half after the discovery of the photographs. As a result of the serious deficiencies investigators found, OCR and USC have entered into a Resolution Agreement (RA) that requires USC to take the following actions: Ensure that its Title IX Coordinator and Title IX Office have the independent authority to respond to reports of sex discrimination and ensure that services provided by the University's health services are compliant with Title IX. Ensure that the Title IX office tracks and monitors every complaint or report of potential sex discrimination and provides OCR with documentation of reports and complaints of sexual harassment. Make reasonable efforts to contact the nine patients who complained of misconduct by Dr. Tyndall and notify current and former students, and current and former University employees who may have interacted with him, to offer to remedy the harm done by sex discrimination. Such remedies may include academic accommodations and counseling, among others. Change its Title IX procedures to ensure that all involved parties receive due process, require training for students, employees, and trustees regarding sex discrimination, and require specialized training for health center employees. Conduct a review of current and former employees to determine whether they took appropriate action upon receiving notice of complaints or concerns regarding Dr. Tyndall. ""What we have found at USC is shocking and reprehensible,"" said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Kenneth L. Marcus. ""No student should ever have to face the disgusting behavior that USC students had to deal with. I am pleased that President Folt is now committing to major changes, and we will closely monitor the University to make sure that it complies with our agreement."" Under the leadership of Secretary DeVos, OCR has moved aggressively to investigate schools that fail to protect students from sexual misconduct and to bring them into compliance with civil rights law. The Department has most notably required sweeping reforms to protect students at Michigan State University and in Chicago Public Schools . Just yesterday, Secretary DeVos announced a new OCR initiative to prevent sexual violence in K-12 schools. The Letter of Finding in the USC case is available here . The Resolution Agreement is available here ."
26-Feb-20,https://web.archive.org/web/20210108025343/https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/secretary-devos-announces-new-civil-rights-initiative-combat-sexual-assault-k-12-public-schools,Secretary DeVos Announces New Civil Rights Initiative to Combat Sexual Assault in K-12 Public Schools,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos announced today a new Title IX enforcement initiative, led by the Department's Office for Civil Rights (OCR), to combat the troubling rise of sexual assault in K-12 public schools. This initiative will enhance OCR's enforcement of Title IX in both elementary and secondary public schools and strengthen the ability of schools to respond to all incidents of sexual harassment and assault. The new initiative also builds on the Department's work to implement the ""Pass the Trash"" provisions of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), which prohibits schools from simply moving employees who have committed acts of sexual misconduct. ""We hear all too often about innocent children being sexually assaulted by an adult at school. That should never happen. No parent should have to think twice about their child's safety while on school grounds,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""That's why I've directed our OCR team to tackle the tragic rise of sexual misconduct complaints in our nation's K-12 campuses head on. Through compliance reviews and raising public awareness about what's actually happening in too many of our nation's schools, we can build on the good work we're already doing to enforce Title IX and protect students. We cannot rest until every student can learn in a safe, nurturing environment where their civil rights are protected."" Title IX requires that schools and districts take appropriate steps to address sex discrimination. The requirements of Title IX apply to incidents of sexual misconduct, including incidents that involve both student-on-student misconduct and staff-on-student misconduct OCR's recent resolution of two sexual harassment complaints involving Chicago Public Schools illustrates the systemic and significant deficiencies that require OCR's intentional and focused examination. In fact, according to the most recent available Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC) for the 2015-2016 school year, there were approximately 9,700 incidents of sexual assault, rape or attempted rape reported in public elementary and secondary schools. OCR's initiative to examine sexual assault will include the following activities: Compliance Reviews: OCR will conduct nationwide compliance reviews in schools and districts, examining how sexual assault cases are handled under Title IX, including sexual incidents involving teachers and school staff. OCR will work with school districts to identify and correct compliance concerns. Public Awareness and Support: OCR will focus on raising awareness of the issue of sexual assault in K-12 schools, including making information available to educators, school leaders, parents and families. Data Quality Reviews: OCR will conduct Data Quality Reviews (DQRs) of the sexual assault/offenses data submitted by school districts through the CRDC. As a part of conducting DQRs, OCR will partner with the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and will work with districts to ensure that incidents of sexual assault/sexual offenses are being accurately recorded and reported through the CRDC. Proposed CRDC Data Collection: OCR has proposed, for the 2019-2020 data collection, to collect more detailed data on sexual assault. The proposed data collection includes incidents perpetrated by school staff or school personnel. If adopted, the inclusion of this data would make the CRDC collection the first universal collection to gather such data systemically by school. ""The number of K-12 sexual harassment and violence complaints filed with OCR is nearly fifteen times greater than it was a decade ago. This disturbing change is a matter of serious concern and requires immediate attention,"" said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Kenneth L. Marcus. ""Secretary DeVos has directed OCR to focus our enforcement, technical assistance, and data-gathering activities on this issue, and we are going to make it a priority going forward."" Today's actions follow the Department's Office of Elementary and Secondary Education's announcement that it will publish an extensive study of measures taken by states and school districts to prevent the phenomenon known as ""Pass the Trash."" The study examines best practices for prevention and raises awareness of the requirement under Section 8546 of ESSA, which prohibits state education agencies, school districts, schools and school employees from assisting an individual in obtaining new employment if the individual has engaged in sexual misconduct with a student or minor. For too long, and too often, teachers who have engaged in sexual misconduct with a student or other minor have appallingly managed to find employment at another school. ""Outlawing the despicable act of 'passing the trash' was a major step toward keeping our children safe from predators while they're at school,"" said U.S. Senator Pat Toomey. ""But it will only work if each state and school district is in compliance with the law. I applaud Secretary DeVos and her department for undertaking new efforts to better protect schoolchildren. Parents deserve to know that when their kids go to school each day, they are going to be in a safe environment where they will not be preyed upon."" This new Title IX enforcement initiative to combat sexual violence in K-12 schools is the second nationwide initiative launched in OCR in the last 13 months. On Jan. 17, 2019, Secretary DeVos announced an initiative to address the possible inappropriate use of restraint and seclusion on children with disabilities. OCR is actively investigating compliance reviews in all 12 of OCR's regional offices and is continuing to provide technical assistance to stakeholders and other groups. OCR has engaged with more than 350 school districts to ensure that restraint and seclusion data are accurate and correctly reported to OCR. Dozens of school districts have submitted corrected data to OCR as a result of OCR's Data Quality Reviews. OCR enforces Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX), 20 U.S.C §§ 1681 et seq., which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs and activities operated by recipients of federal financial assistance. Title IX's prohibition of discrimination includes sexual harassment and assault, which interferes with students' rights to receive an education free from discrimination on the basis of sex."

The updated website now features new tools, which provide students with detailed information about the grants and loans they have received and guide them to a personalized recommendation for a loan repayment plan. Federal Student Aid (FSA) also launched a pilot that allows a subset of the office's 42 million borrowers, for the first time ever, to make student loan payments directly on StudentAid.gov. These updates complement the President's fiscal year 2021 budget proposal , which includes calls to simplify student loan types, amounts, and repayment options and provide customers with access to an online portal with personalized information to help them easily understand their options and make informed decisions throughout the financial aid life cycle. ""Students deserve to be treated like the unique and valued customers they are,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""Congress created a cumbersome and confusing web of loan and repayment options, but we continue to make great strides at FSA in providing borrowers with more detailed, personalized, and actionable information so they can take control of financing their education. Whether it's launching the first-ever myStudentAid mobile app, updating the College Scorecard with previously unavailable data, or now offering a set of personalized tools for better student loan information, we have continued to do better by students and families."" These enhancements are the first of several upgrades to the website that will roll out this year. The new Aid Summary feature allows customers to see specific information for each grant and loan they have received, including the type, date received, repayment plan, and interest rate. Customers can use this tool to track their remaining eligibility for William D. Ford Direct Loans and Federal Pell Grants. Borrowers will also be able to see their progress toward repaying their loans, receive alerts about their account, and track the number of qualifying payments they have made toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF). The Loan Simulator helps borrowers chart a course to successful repayment by allowing them to compare options. The tool combines information entered by borrowers, such as earnings and family composition, with loan data provided by FSA to develop a personalized repayment strategy. Borrowers can use the simulator to compare repayment plans and test-drive which plan provides them with the lowest monthly payment, fastest payoff term, or lowest amount paid overall. Borrowers whose federally managed loans are in repayment and assigned to servicers Great Lakes or Nelnet can now participate in the Make a Payment pilot. This pilot program allows borrowers to schedule upcoming monthly payments right on StudentAid.gov. Eventually, all Direct Loan borrowers will be able to repay their loans through StudentAid.gov. ""We're delivering on the promise of access to higher education to our nation's students and their families,"" said Mark A. Brown, FSA chief operating officer. ""We are on a journey, and today's news is just the beginning of what's to come."" Today's rollout is part of the Next Gen FSA initiative, launched by Secretary DeVos to bring the federal student aid process and organization into the 21st century."

The initiative, known as an experimental site, expands FWS opportunities for students at 190 institutions. Institutions participating in the experimental site will be granted waivers, which encourage them to expand the use of FWS funds to support more students working in the private sector and, for the first time, allow them to pay low-income students for work experiences required by their academic programs, such as student teaching and clinical rotations. “We know that early, meaningful work experience can be an important stepping stone toward students obtaining good jobs and having successful careers,” said Secretary DeVos. “For too long, Federal Work-Study has put up artificial barriers between education and industry and deprived students from gaining useful experience in their field of study. Rather than working the dorm cafeteria line, students–particularly low-income students–will be able to ‘earn and learn’ in ways that will set them up for future success.” This experiment also provides additional Job Location and Development (JLD) program funds to participating institutions and expands the allowable uses of those funds, including permitting institutions to contract third-party intermediaries to help them build partnerships with businesses. These job development activities can be used to benefit students regardless of whether they participate in FWS. During award year 2016-2017, more than 3,000 colleges and universities provided over 600,000 students with FWS opportunities, but less than one-tenth of one percent supported off-campus employment with private sector employers. Current regulations also require private sector employers, including small businesses, to pay a higher portion of wages than on-campus employment or non-profit organizations, further raising barriers to relevant work experience. This experimental site is designed to assess whether students are better served when they are paid for work-based learning and allowed access to off-campus FWS employment aligned with their program, as measured by student retention, completion and improved job opportunities after graduation. The experiment will provide important data to inform future policy proposals on Federal Work-Study reform."
12-Feb-20,https://web.archive.org/web/20210108025343/https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/test-0,U.S. Department of Education Launches Investigation into Foreign Gifts Reporting at Ivy League Universities,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Education announced today it is launching investigations into both Harvard and Yale Universities after it appears both Ivy League higher education institutions potentially failed to report hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign gifts and contracts. In recent weeks, the Department discovered Yale University may have failed to report at least $375 million in foreign gifts and contracts, choosing not to report any gifts and contracts over the last four years. The Department is also concerned Harvard University may lack appropriate institutional controls over foreign money and has failed to report fully all foreign gifts and contracts as required by law. This comes after Dr. Charles Lieber, chair of Harvard University’s Chemistry and Chemical Biology Department, was indicted for lying about his involvement with the Chinese government’s Thousand Talents Plan and admitting that Harvard lacks adequate institutional controls for effective oversight and tracking of very large donations. “This is about transparency,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. “If colleges and universities are accepting foreign money and gifts, their students, donors, and taxpayers deserve to know how much and from whom. Moreover, it’s what the law requires. Unfortunately, the more we dig, the more we find that too many are underreporting or not reporting at all. We will continue to hold colleges and universities accountable and work with them to ensure their reporting is full, accurate, and transparent, as required by the law.” Section 117 of the Higher Education Act requires American Title IV-eligible colleges and universities to report gifts from, and contracts with, any foreign source that exceed $250,000 in value and to disclose any foreign ownership or control, twice each year. The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations described foreign spending on U.S. schools as “a black hole” because colleges and universities “routinely” fail to comply with the law, and reported foreign money can come with strings attached that might compromise academic freedom. The Department’s records since approximately 1990 show U.S. universities and colleges have reported donations from Qatar, China, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates in excess of $6.6 billion, but this sum may be significantly underestimated. According to investigations by Congress, GAO, and the Department, colleges and universities significantly underreport their foreign gifts and contracts. The 2019 Senate Report found the following: Nearly 70% of U.S. schools that received more than $250,000 from Hanban failed to properly report that information to the Department of Education. From January 2012 to June 2018, 15 U.S. schools reported receiving $15,472,725 directly from Hanban, a propaganda arm of the Chinese government. To get a more comprehensive understanding of Hanban’s spending in the United States, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations requested financial records from 100 U.S. schools and found Hanban directly contributed $113,428,509 to U.S schools—more than seven times the amount U.S. schools actually reported (Senate Report at p. 70). On average, fewer than 300 of the approximately 6,000 U.S. colleges and universities report receiving foreign money each year. The data indicates most foreign funds reportedly flow into approximately 50 large institutions. Additional Information on the Department’s Section 117 Enforcement Actions: Since July 1, 2019, the Department’s enforcement efforts have triggered the reporting of approximately $6.5 billion in previously undisclosed foreign money. Ten schools, including Cornell University, Yale University, the University of Colorado Boulder, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Chicago, the University of Pennsylvania, Boston University, Texas A&M University, and Carnegie Mellon University reported approximately $3.6 billion in previously unreported foreign gifts. The Department has opened eight civil compliance investigations since June 28, 2019. The Department has reported its preliminary findings to Congress, including: The largest colleges and universities are multi-billion dollar, multi-national enterprises using opaque foundations, foreign campuses, and other sophisticated legal structures to generate revenue that is intermingled with domestic sources of funding from tuition, grants, and the like. These colleges and universities actively solicit foreign governments, corporations, and nationals for funds although some donors are known to be hostile to the United States and may be seeking to project “soft power,” steal sensitive and proprietary research and development data and other intellectual property, and spread propaganda benefitting foreign governments. Although foreign money generally flows into the largest and richest colleges and universities, such money apparently does not reduce or otherwise offset American students’ tuition costs. Consistent with Congressional and GAO findings, Section 117 reporting is significantly underinclusive and inaccurate. The Department published for public comment a modern and robust information collection under the Paperwork Reduction Act to promote compliance and transparency. The new information collection appears in the Federal Register , and the new reporting portal will be mandatory for the foreign money reports due by July 31, 2020."

This website is a one-stop-shop of resources for K-12 administrators, educators, parents, and law enforcement to use to prepare for and address various threats related to safety, security, and support in schools. President Trump established the Federal Commission on School Safety to review safety practices and make meaningful and actionable recommendations of best practices to keep students safe. ""School safety is the number one priority of parents across the country, which is why the President directed DHS and other federal agencies to form a taskforce and provide schools, teachers, parents, and law enforcement with resources to identify, prepare for, respond to, and mitigate threats,"" said Chad Wolf, Acting Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. ""The Department provided expertise and resources on a range of school safety issues including threat assessments, physical security, emergency planning, and trainings and exercises designed to help schools and local law enforcement prepare for incidents. With these resources, schools and law enforcement will be better equipped to handle a crisis."" ""All students deserve a safe learning environment, and the Federal School Safety Clearinghouse is an essential resource for information and best practices,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, chair of the Federal Commission on School Safety. ""Because every school community has its own unique needs, SchoolSafety.gov equips decision makers with resources for developing, customizing, and implementing actionable school safety plans."" ""Every child should feel safe at school, and every parent should feel their child is safe each day, too,"" said HHS Secretary Alex Azar. ""SchoolSafety.gov will help equip schools with the tools they need to create safe, healthy environments, including resources for how to provide mental health services in schools. This new one-stop shop complements the evidence-based technical assistance HHS provides to local communities around mental health treatment, and we hope to see more and more schools explore these opportunities."" ""The Department of Justice has no higher priority than making sure our schools are safe and secure for our nation's students, teachers and administrators,"" said Attorney General William P. Barr. ""I am grateful for President Trump's leadership in this cause and am honored to stand with the rest of the leadership of his Administration as we continue our efforts to promote school safety through SchoolSafety.gov. The Department of Justice is deeply grateful for the sacrifice and commitment of our nation's school resource officers and police officers who are on the front lines of keeping our schools and country safe every day."" SchoolSafety.gov is a resource for the American public, primarily K-12 school administrators, to access free information, guidance, best practices, and tools that make school safety initiatives more actionable in schools. Today's launch represents the first phase of SchoolSafety.gov, and we look forward to continually expanding and refining resource materials in coordination with our partners and stakeholders. The Federal School Safety Clearinghouse and SchoolSafety.gov were developed to fulfill one of the key recommendations from the Federal Commission on School Safety. SchoolSafety.gov includes: The School Safety Readiness Tool, an assessment that assists users in evaluating their respective school's safety posture across 10 foundational elements of school safety. After completing the assessment, users are provided an action plan with task prioritization, options for consideration, aligned resources, and grant opportunities specific to individual needs; A Secure Information Sharing Platform for designated school personnel to share school safety ideas, practices, plans, and tactics in a protected environment; and A wide array of resources and best practices on key school safety topics to assist with building awareness within the school community to promote vigilance and build capacity to respond to incidents. SchoolSafety.gov empowers districts and schools to improve safety and security. In March 2018—following the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, on Feb. 14—President Trump signed an executive order establishing the Federal Commission on School Safety to make meaningful advancements in keeping students safe. The Trump Administration and DHS also released the 2019 strategy for targeted violence that defines ways that the Department of Homeland Security will enhance security with increased preparedness, promoting community readiness, and enhancing defensive measures. The Department of Homeland Security will continue to develop new techniques in protective practices."
10-Feb-20,https://web.archive.org/web/20210108025343/https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/president-trump-proposes-transformative-student-first-budget-return-power-states-limit-federal-control-education,"President Trump Proposes Transformative, Student-First Budget to Return Power to States, Limit Federal Control of Education","WASHINGTON — The President released today his budget request for the U.S. Department of Education for the 2021 fiscal year. This transformative, student-first budget prioritizes improving student achievement, reducing the outsized Federal role in education, and returning control over education decisions to whom it belongs—State and local leaders, teachers, parents, and students. The budget calls for consolidating nearly all existing K-12 formula and competitive grant programs into one block grant to States, called the Elementary and Secondary Education for the Disadvantaged (ESED) Block Grant. Funds would be allocated using the same formulas as the Title I Grants to Local Educational Agencies program. The budget also builds on the multi-year Federal Student Aid (FSA) reform project U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos launched in 2018 to improve management, oversight, and administration of student aid programs. To that end, the budget also proposes to answer a question Secretary DeVos asked at last year's FSA training conference: Why isn't FSA a stand-alone government corporation, run by a professional, expert, and apolitical Board of Governors? ""This budget proposal is about one thing—putting students and their needs above all else,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""That starts with creating Education Freedom Scholarships and helping 1 million more students find the best educational fit for them. We know education freedom helps students succeed, and it's long past time for Congress to act to give students and their families more choices and more control. ""Our budget puts an end to education earmarks. Instead of Washington politicians and bureaucrats forcing local schools to spend limited resources on D.C.'s priorities, this budget proposes putting state and local leaders, teachers, parents, and students themselves in control of education. Our block grant proposal simply aligns the resources with the law of the land—the Every Student Succeeds Act. States will be free to focus on people, not paperwork. Results, not regulations. We know States will spend their money differently, and that's okay. In fact, that's what we hope they do. They know best how to serve their students. ""We also propose making critical new investments in supporting children with disabilities, moving closer to fulfilling Congress' promise to fully fund the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). And we're asking for new resources for career and technical education to ensure every student in America has access to skills training to help them prepare for successful careers. ""Our proposal further asks Congress to partner with us in studying the Office of Federal Student Aid becoming a stand-alone entity. FSA has, in recent years, essentially ballooned into a $1.5 trillion bank that has outgrown its current governance structure. Students and their families deserve better from FSA. In the meantime, we're continuing to build on our important customer-centric Next Generation reforms. Through a singular FSA platform, operating system, and unified website, we will provide customers with a seamless student loan experience from application through repayment. We're also providing students with more information than ever before so they can make better decisions about how they finance their education."" Highlights from the President's FY 2021 Budget Request include the following: Expanding Education Freedom for Students Education Freedom Scholarships (EFS) would provide up to $5 billion in additional education funding to help more than 1 million students across the country find their education fit This proposal would dramatically expand the options available to families States, not the Federal government, will design their own programs aimed at serving their students. Each State's family eligibility requirements and allowable uses of scholarship funds will be aligned with their State's unique needs Funded by private, voluntary donations, EFS does not do a thing to change any funding amount already allocated to public school students or public school teachers Empowering States to Best Meet the Needs of Students The Elementary and Secondary Education for the Disadvantaged (ESED) Block Grant consolidates most K-12 formula and competitive grant programs administered by the Department into one $19.4 billion formula grant program This proposal builds on the promise of ESSA and right-sizes the Federal role in education by empowering States and school districts to spend Federal taxpayer funds the way they see fit to best support their most disadvantaged students Funds would be allocated using the same formulas as the Title I Grants to Local Educational Agencies program States and local districts could use the funds for any authorized purposes of the consolidated programs, while continuing to meet accountability and reporting requirements aimed at protecting students, supporting school improvement, and providing parents the information they need to make education decisions for their children Increasing Career and Technical Education Opportunities for Students The FY 2021 budget request dramatically increases funding for Career and Technical Education (CTE) programs by $900 million This supports the Administration's goal of ensuring every high school student in America has access to CTE programs that provide multiple, high-quality pathways to success after graduation This request includes $2 billion, an increase of $680 million, for CTE State Grants to support high-quality CTE programs in high school and postsecondary institutions and $90 million, an increase of $83 million, for CTE National Programs to support high-quality CTE programs in STEM, including computer science The budget also renews the President's proposal to double the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act fee for the H-1B visa program which could generate an estimated $117 million in additional funding for the CTE State Grants program Transforming Federal Student Aid to Better Serve Students This budget request proposes continued modernization of all aspects of FSA in order to better serve its customers, including a call for an evaluation of FSA as a separate organization, with reformed governance A new governance model would lead to improved management, oversight, and administration of student aid programs The budget also proposes to simplify the Federal student loan programs and student loan repayment by reducing the numerous and complicated loan types, establishing reasonable annual and lifetime limits on those loans, providing higher education institutions more flexibility to help students avoid overborrowing, and streamlining income-based repayment plans The budget request continues to fund the multi-year Next Generation (Next Gen) student aid platform improvements, including the development and implementation of a new mobile-first, singular loan servicing platform that consolidates all customer-facing websites into one and provides customers with a seamless experience from application through repayment Additional Critical Investments: $14 billion for IDEA programs, a $100 million increase over FY 2020 enacted levels for IDEA Grants to States $150 million, an increase of $137.4 million, for the Minority Science and Engineering Improvement Program (MSEIP) to fund STEM activities led by HBCUs and MSIs located in Opportunity Zones $749.2 million for HBCU programs, an increase of $44 million over FY 2020 enacted level $343 million for MSIs, an increase of $87.4 million, or 34%, over the FY 2020 enacted level To view details of the full budget request, click here . Support for President Trump's FY 2021 Education Budget Proposal: Governor Ron DeSantis, Florida ""Improving the quality and effectiveness of education for Florida's students is a priority of my administration, and I am pleased that President Donald J. Trump and U.S. Department of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos are supportive of our efforts. Every state has unique needs and challenges, and Florida is well-equipped to determine the best use of education resources that will lead to the ultimate goal of increased student outcomes."" Commissioner Frank Edelblut, New Hampshire Department of Education ""The people who know best what New Hampshire's students and teachers need are families and educators in New Hampshire. President Trump and Secretary DeVos are right to restore local control and get the federal government out of the way. The proposed block grant would give us much-needed flexibility to align resources with the students and programs that need them the most. This is a big win for our students, teachers, principals and states."" Superintendent Elsie Arntzen, Montana Office of Public Instruction ""I want to thank President Trump and Secretary DeVos for their commitment to student-driven education and local control. In Montana, we know that one size does not fit all and that every student and community is unique. The President's proposed 2021 education budget offers exciting opportunities to help Montana students succeed. Increased funding for career and technical education will provide students with the tools necessary to be Montana Ready after high school. Consolidated federal grants will allow school leaders and the Office of Public Instruction to spend more time serving students and less time on burdensome federal reporting. Education Freedom Scholarships will give Montana families additional financial resources to access dual enrollment, Advanced Placement, CTE coursework, work-based learning, tuition assistance, individualized education, and more. As Montana's Superintendent of Public Instruction, I will continue working with local, state, and federal partners to expand learning opportunities for Montana students— giving every student the opportunity to succeed."" Commissioner Richard Corcoran, Florida Commissioner of Education ""President Trump and Secretary DeVos have truly made educational freedom the foundation of education throughout our nation and have empowered states to make decisions that best serve students. Receiving a great education creates life-long learners and develops all students to have strong character. All students throughout the nation deserve the chance to receive a world-class education, be successful, and be civically engaged members of society, and I am proud to support this plan. This powerful collaboration with states enables educational opportunities to be placed back in the hands of states, local districts, and most importantly, parents, the people that know their children the best."" Chairman Andy Tuck, Florida State Board of Education ""President Trump and Secretary DeVos have repeatedly made a strong commitment to spending taxpayer dollars wisely by consolidating duplicative federal programs that are better implemented at the state and local level. They truly understand that each student is unique and have empowered the nation, and Florida, to make great decisions that best serve individual students' needs. This plan puts students first and returns the freedom and power of a quality education to where it belongs: with families throughout our nation."" Kermit Kaleba, National Skills Coalition ""Increased federal support for career and technical education will help more students, including adult learners, get the skills and credentials they need to succeed in a 21st century economy. These are investments both workers and businesses think are critical – 85% of voters and 79% of businesses support greater public investment in skills. We're pleased to see the Administration doubling down on CTE in the Fiscal Year 2021 Budget, and we urge Congress to take up the call for greater investment in America's workforce."" Jon Graft, Butler Tech (Career and Technical Education for Adults and Teens in Ohio) ""As a public school of choice, Butler Tech is able to offer over 200 different course options and 27 unique programs on our 5 campuses for high school and adult education learners. Serving over 17,000 learners in a year, Butler Tech is one of the largest career tech centers in the state of Ohio. With the robust economy and the demand for skilled trades and healthcare jobs at an all-time high, the additional commitment to Career and Technical Education funding could not come at a more opportune time. Sadly, Butler Tech currently turns away 47% of our applicants due to our current inability to expand high demand programs such as Welding, Information Technology, Mechatronics, Aviation Exploration and Healthcare. Through Perkins funding expansion, we will be able make a significant dent in providing skilled workers to the companies in Ohio that anticipate 12,000 annual job openings for in-demand occupations through 2024 (Ohio Department of Job and Family Services). We are excited to make the American Dream a reality for our students."" Kim Green, Advance CTE ""Advance CTE and its members are grateful for this significantly increased investment to support high-quality Career and Technical Education (CTE). Advance CTE partners with many federal programs to ensure the success of each learner, and we believe that the budget must ensure robust support for the entire continuum of education and workforce programs. This additional funding will go a long way in helping to ensure that every learner in America—no matter their age, zip code or background—has access to high-quality CTE that leads to a fulfilling career and ensures a family-sustaining wage."" Vince Bertram, President and CEO of Project Lead the Way ""America's global competitiveness requires a highly skilled workforce, and the opportunity to pursue the American Dream can be realized if our students develop the knowledge and skills necessary to thrive in our rapidly evolving economy. Investing today in America's students and career and technical education is an essential investment in our nation's future."" LeAnn Wilson, Association for Career and Technical Education ""High-quality career and technical education (CTE) programs prepare millions of students in high schools and community and technical colleges around the country for careers in in-demand fields. An increase in Perkins funds to support these programs, particularly if leveraged with other important federal resources for education and workforce development programs, will help to ensure today's learners are fully prepared with the skills needed to power America's 21st century economy."""

Trump's 2020 State of the Union Address: “Tonight, the President delivered a strong message in support of America’s students and their futures. Every student, parent, and teacher should be excited by this bold agenda to free them from a government system that limits their success. We know all too well that too many students can’t read or do basic math at the level they should; in fact, one in four eighth graders is functionally illiterate. President Trump is ensuring these forgotten students are forgotten no more. “This Administration wants every American, no matter their age, income, zip code, or stage in life, to have access to K-12 and higher education options that work for them, unlock their individual potential, and help them pursue successful careers in our booming economy. That’s evidenced by the President’s strong commitment to career and technical education and apprenticeship expansion, higher education reform, Second Chance Pell expansion, and Education Freedom Scholarships. “I urge Congress to heed the President’s call to pass the Administration’s Education Freedom Scholarships proposal. Education freedom is inevitable. We know it works for students, and we know overwhelming majorities of Americans want it. I’m grateful to the President for his strong support of this proposal from day one and look forward to Congress acting quickly on this bipartisan issue and putting students’ needs above everything else.”"

Massachusetts, North Carolina, Texas and Vermont were recently approved to participate in the Education Flexibility Program (Ed-Flex), which was updated by the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA). Ed-Flex encourages local innovation and returns power to states from the U.S. Department of Education by allowing states to waive certain federal statutory or regulatory requirements under the law. ""We are committed to shifting control over education decisions from Washington back to where it belongs: in the hands of state and local education leaders who know what's best for their students and communities,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""This important program provides an additional mechanism for us to do so. I am pleased to approve Massachusetts, North Carolina, Texas and Vermont to participate in Ed-Flex and look forward to seeing what these states will accomplish with more flexibility and less micromanagement from Washington."" In their successful applications, these states proposed to use additional flexibility to release school districts from onerous federal requirements in favor of a locally-driven approach. The state goals are as follows: Massachusetts plans to use the flexibility to enhance educator recruitment and licensure. North Carolina will use the flexibility to address class size, school year schedule and funding to schools in areas of need. Texas intends to provide flexibility around staff development requirements, teacher certification and attendance requirements. Vermont will use the flexibility to enhance school districts' ability to implement long-term improvement initiatives while keeping their focus on improving student outcomes. All states are eligible to apply to the Ed-Flex program, and the U.S. Department of Education continues to accept applications for the program.

Secretary DeVos named former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour, one of the new appointees, as chair of the Board. The Governing Board is a nonpartisan body that works independently from the U.S. Department of Education to set policy for the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), also known as The Nation's Report Card. NAEP provides objective information on student performance in various subjects and allows comparisons of student achievement among states, large urban districts, and various student groups. The 26-member Governing Board is responsible for deciding which subjects NAEP assesses, determining the assessments' content, setting achievement levels that describe student performance, and pursuing new ways to make NAEP results meaningful to the public. ""I am pleased to welcome these new members to the National Assessment Governing Board,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""Their richly diverse backgrounds will help the Board as it continues its critical work to inform students, parents, educators and policymakers about the state of American education. The latest Nation's Report Card shows a student achievement crisis, especially in reading, and I'm eager to see how the Board continues to tackle that critical challenge. I especially want to thank Governor Barbour for his willingness to serve as board chair. His experience leading education reform in Mississippi, the fruit of which is seen in the latest Report Card, is one of many assets he will bring to the table."" The Governing Board appointees announced today are the final three board members to be appointed for the 2019-2023 term. Their terms officially began on Oct. 1, 2019 and will end on Sept. 30, 2023. The newly appointed Governing Board members and the roles they represent on the Board are as follows: Haley Barbour, Board Chair and General Public Representative: Barbour was governor of Mississippi from 2004 to 2012, where he focused on education reform and improving student outcomes. Previously, Barbour had served in the White House under President Ronald Reagan and as chairman of the Republican Governors Association from 2009 to 2011. Barbour returned to BGR Group—the government affairs firm he founded—after leaving the governor's office. His term as chair of the board will start immediately and end on Sept. 30, 2020. Christine Cunningham, Curriculum Specialist: Cunningham is a professor of education and engineering at the College of Education at The Pennsylvania State University and founder of the Engineering is Elementary Program at the Museum of Science in Boston. She won the Harold W. McGraw, Jr. Prize in Education in 2017 for pioneering curriculum that introduces engineering concepts and practices at the elementary level. Patrick Kelly, Twelfth-Grade Teacher: Patrick Kelly works in a hybrid role teaching AP U.S. Government and Politics and serving as coordinator of professional learning for Richland School District 2 outside of Columbia, S.C. Kelly is certified by the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards and was a finalist for the South Carolina State Teacher of the Year award in 2014.

The OPEN Center will provide assistance and support to schools, educators, families, and students to ensure better awareness of the requirements and protections of federal non-discrimination laws. ""The creation of the OPEN Center is yet another example of this Department's focus on supporting school districts, colleges, and those closest to students,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""The OPEN Center underscores OCR's efforts to support all schools and provide technical assistance to help them come into compliance with federal civil rights law prior to the filing of a complaint. This agency will continue supporting school districts and colleges by working with them cooperatively to ensure that every child has access to a quality education."" While OCR typically enforces federal civil rights laws through the traditional complaint-resolution process, OCR will, through the provision of targeted support to recipient institutions and the public, also be able to work more proactively—prior to the filing of complaints—to ensure that schools are aware of their obligations under federal civil rights law. By investing resources in technical assistance and public education, OCR will provide not only much-needed assistance to recipients, but also better support students, families, and stakeholders. ""The OPEN Center is all about strengthening civil rights compliance through voluntary, proactive activities,"" said Assistant Secretary Kenneth L. Marcus. ""Instead of waiting for violations to occur before responding, OCR will get in front of the problem, partnering with educators and other institutions to better protect students. As the name implies, we want to be a better resource, more welcoming and supportive of students, families, educators, and communities."" The OPEN Center, established within OCR headquarters, will provide OCR with a dedicated team that focuses on education, prevention, and outreach. It will also provide for improved technical assistance to recipients and the public through a dedicated team to ensure that technical assistance is high-quality, accurate, thorough, and legally sound. The OPEN Center will be staffed by OCR civil rights attorneys and will be led by Acting Director, Christian Corrigan. OPEN Center inquiries can be sent to OPEN@ed.gov ."

The Department announced a proposed rule ensuring the equal treatment and constitutional rights of religious organizations and faith-based institutions, as well as First Amendment freedoms owed to students on campus. As directed by Congress, the agency will also release updated guidance regarding constitutionally protected prayer in schools. ""Our actions today will protect the constitutional rights of students, teachers, and faith-based institutions,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""The Department's efforts will level the playing field between religious and non-religious organizations competing for federal grants, as well as protect First Amendment freedoms on campus and the religious liberty of faith-based institutions. I proudly share President Trump's commitment to religious freedom and the First Amendment."" The Department's rule addresses five general areas of importance to religious organizations, faith-based institutions, and their students. First, along with several other agencies, the Department's proposed rule seeks to implement President Trump's Executive Order 13831, Executive Order on the Establishment of a White House Faith and Opportunity Initiative . The proposed rule would ensure that religious and non-religious organizations are treated equally by the federal government and that organizations are not discriminated against simply because they are religious in nature, removing unequal, burdensome regulatory requirements imposed by the Obama administration. The proposed rule would ensure that the Department's direct grant programs and state-administered formula grant programs are implemented in a manner consistent with religious liberty protections in federal law, including the First Amendment and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act . Second, student organizations, including faith-based student organizations, play an important role at public institutions of higher education. Their First Amendment rights, including the freedom of association, must also be protected. Accordingly, the proposed regulations require that, as a material condition of a direct grant or a subgrant from a state-administered formula grant program, a public institution of higher education not deny to a faith-based student organization any of the rights, benefits, or privileges otherwise afforded to non-faith-based student organizations. Third, the Department proposes to amend regulations governing the Strengthening Institutions Program, the Developing Hispanic-Serving Institutions Program, the Strengthening Historically Black Colleges and Universities Program, and the Strengthening Historically Black Graduate Institutions Program of the Higher Education Act. The proposed revisions address constitutional concerns about the prohibition to use development grants for activities or services if they merely relate to ""sectarian instruction"" and ""religious worship."" The proposed regulations prohibit use of such grants for activities or services that constitute religious instruction, religious worship, or proselytization consistent with the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and other federal laws. The Department also proposes to amend the definition of a ""school or department of divinity"" in a manner that is more consistent with the First Amendment and other federal laws. Fourth, in its proposed rule, the Department also seeks to clarify how an educational institution may demonstrate that it is controlled by a religious organization for purposes of Title IX. Neither Title IX nor its regulations define what it means for a school to be ""controlled by a religious organization."" Over the years, the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights (OCR) has posted on its website several internal memoranda on this question. Because these OCR memoranda constitute only non-binding, non-regulatory guidance, the Department desires to engage in notice and comment rulemaking on this issue and to obtain the views of the public in crafting an appropriate final regulation. Fifth, to implement Executive Order 13864, Improving Free Inquiry, Transparency, and Accountability at Colleges and Universities , the Department also proposes regulations to ensure public institutions of higher education that receive federal research or education grants comply with the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, as a material condition of a direct grant or a subgrant from a state-administered formula grant program. The Department also proposes regulations to ensure that private institutions of higher education that receive federal research or education grants comply with their stated institutional policies regarding freedom of speech, including academic freedom. Because state and federal courts remain the best arbiters of alleged violations of First Amendment freedoms, the Department proposes to determine that a public institution has not complied with the First Amendment only if there is a final, non-default judgment by a state or federal court that the public institution or an employee of the public institution, acting in his or her official capacity, violated the First Amendment. Similarly, the Department proposes to determine that a private institution has not complied with its stated institutional policies regarding freedom of speech only if there is a final, non-default judgment by a state or federal court that the private institution violated the institutional policy. In a separate action, for the first time since 2003, the Department will also issue today updated guidance on constitutionally protected prayer in public elementary and secondary schools. The Department is required by the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA), as amended by the Every Student Succeeds Act , to update this guidance every two years. The guidance explains the ESEA's requirement that states report which local educational agencies have not certified that they do not have any policy that prevents, or otherwise denies participation in, constitutionally protected prayer. The ESEA also requires states to report complaints against a local educational agency that allegedly denies a person, including a student or employee, the right to engage in constitutionally protected prayer. The guidance clarifies that the ESEA requires states to provide a clear process for students, parents, and teachers to report violations of their right to pray. Under the ESEA, states must fulfill these reporting requirements by November 1 of each year."

The new StudentAid.gov is now the singular place where students, parents, and borrowers can learn about available types of student aid, find the right repayment plan, complete loan counseling, and fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA®) form. The new StudentAid.gov consolidates into one singular location the student-facing portions of StudentLoans.gov, fsaid.ed.gov, and nslds.ed.gov. In addition to the revamped website, borrowers can now access all the loan servicer contact centers through one phone number: 1-800-4-FED-AID. This number includes a new interactive voice response function to direct customers to the appropriate place, eliminating confusion and frustration for borrowers. The my StudentAid mobile app has also been updated and enhanced so that customers can seamlessly switch between completing tasks on the app and the web. ""Federal Student Aid's customers visit our websites more than 120 million times each year,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""By centralizing the information they need on one website, providing one singular phone number to call, and continually improving our mobile app, we can better serve students and cut down on the confusion of navigating the federal student aid process."" As Secretary DeVos promised at this year's Federal Student Aid Conference, Aidan , FSA's new digital assistant, is also making its debut. Ten percent of federal student aid borrowers now have access to Aidan . The online virtual assistant can answer questions borrowers may have as they navigate the student aid experience. Aidan can already answer more than 800 questions about federal student aid and is learning more from feedback submitted by users during this pilot program. Aidan will be available to additional customers on a rolling basis. The improvements announced today are another major public-facing step in the Next Gen FSA transformation the Secretary announced in 2018 with the goal of modernizing the federal student aid process from application through repayment."

The $155 million in grant funds will be used to aid a variety of education-related disaster recovery efforts. Funds can be used for activities such as mental health and safety programs for students and staff, replacing instructional materials lost during storms, additional transportation costs for students, faculty and staff salaries, and debris removal and mold mitigation from schools. ""We know that full recovery from natural disasters can be a long and difficult process for everyone involved,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. ""Through our various grant programs, we will continue to come alongside state and local leaders and assist in their efforts to rebuild, recover and allow the learning process to continue for students and educators who may still be dealing with the trauma of these difficult events."" The new funding supports three grant programs administered by the Department's Disaster Recovery Unit in the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education and the Higher Education division of the Office of Postsecondary Education: Immediate Aid to Restart School Operations grants are awarded to state education agencies to provide assistance or services related to the restart of operations in, the reopening of, and the re-enrollment of students in public and non-public elementary and secondary schools that serve an area affected by a covered disaster or emergency. Temporary Emergency Impact Aid for Displaced Students grants are awarded to state education agencies to disperse to help districts pay the extra costs of providing education to students displaced by natural disasters. Emergency Assistance to Institutions of Higher Education grant awards are provided to institutions of higher education to mitigate the effects of a covered disaster or emergency, including renovation or reconstruction of damaged facilities. Priority is given to projects that support students who are, or are at risk of becoming, homeless in the aftermath of a natural disaster. Grant amounts are decided based on the impact data and estimated or actual recovery costs provided by applicants, as well as the number of applicants.

The Act contains several important higher education reforms championed by the Secretary that will benefit students for decades to come: ""This administration continues to put students first, and this historic bill is another example of our commitment to them. The more than 300,000 students who attend Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), along with millions more at Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs), will benefit from consistent funding for their treasured institutions. This law also marks a long-sought victory for simplifying and improving the FAFSA® for the nearly 20 million students and families who complete it each year. From day one, I have worked with Secretary Mnuchin, Sen. Alexander and many other congressional leaders from both sides of the aisle to advance these common-sense reforms signed into law today. From eliminating up to 22 questions on the FAFSA® form to reducing burdensome verification paperwork, applying for and receiving student aid will now be easier, faster and more secure than ever. Importantly, this law ensures students will not have to provide the government the same information twice, which also protects taxpayers from improper payments. ""The FUTURE Act will have a lasting impact on students and their families. President Trump will continue to support all students and ensure they can pursue the education needed to succeed in our thriving economy."""

In fact, in rankings released last week, the Department earned an A+ on the December 2019 Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA) scorecard. The Department achieved top marks in five of the seven graded categories, including transparency and risk management, software licensing, agency CIO authority enhancements, portfolio review, and data center optimization initiative. This is a major about-face for the agency, which, just four years ago, under the previous administration, scored an F. ""We committed from day one to putting students first and making sure that what’s best for them is at the center of everything we do,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""Through our Chief Information Officer Jason Gray’s leadership, we have been able to reform our IT infrastructure to better and more efficiently serve students while at the same time, reducing costs to taxpayers. I’m grateful to Jason for his vision and his commitment to the Department’s mission."" The FITARA scorecard, issued biannually, uses data from the Government Accountability Office to make determinations. This is the ninth iteration of the FITARA scorecard, which was first released in November 2015. The Department’s grade has risen steadily under the leadership of Secretary DeVos and CIO Jason Gray. Now, the Department is one of three leading agencies out of a group of 24."
10-Dec-19,https://web.archive.org/web/20210108025343/https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/secretary-devos-approves-new-methodology-providing-student-loan-relief-borrower-defense-applicants,Secretary DeVos Approves New Methodology for Providing Student Loan Relief to Borrower Defense Applicants,"WASHINGTON –Today, U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos announced the Department has implemented a new methodology for assessing borrower defense to repayment (BDR) claims, many of which were left behind by the previous administration. The new methodology relies on publicly available earnings data and a scientifically robust statistical methodology to determine harm. “Despite the mess we inherited from the previous administration, we committed from day one to getting this right for students and taxpayers,” said Secretary DeVos. “We cannot tolerate fraud in higher education, nor can we tolerate furiously giving away taxpayer money to those who have submitted a false claim or aren’t eligible for relief. This new methodology treats students fairly and ensures that taxpayers who did not go to college or who faithfully paid off their student loans do not shoulder student loan costs for those who didn’t suffer harm.” As illustrated in the chart below, the new borrower defense relief methodology relies on publicly available data to compare median earnings of graduates who have made BDR claims to the median earnings of graduates from comparable programs. If the earnings from the school in question under the BDR application are lower than the median for that program at all comparable schools, then they will be determined to have suffered harm and will receive student loan relief, either in full or in part: Earnings lower than two standard deviations from the median will result in full relief. Successful BDR applicants whose program earnings are lower than the median but higher than two standard deviations from the median will receive tiered relief of either 25%, 50%, or 75%, based on their program's earnings deviation from the median. To calculate harm and determine the relief amount, the Department is relying on publicly available 2017 Gainful Employment earnings data, Social Security Administration earnings, College Scorecard data and IRS information. Because of promises made by the prior administration, and damages likely caused to those borrowers by the Department’s continuous efforts to use Corinthian Colleges, Inc. (CCI) institutions as an example, the Department will award no less than 10% relief to all eligible CCI Borrower Defense applicants, regardless of program earnings. Hundreds of claims adjudicated utilizing the new methodology, mostly consisting of Corinthian and ITT borrowers, will be released this week. FSA will also resume notifying borrowers that their loans are ineligible for relief under the 2016 BDR regulation based on the following factors: Borrowers did not have Direct Loans related to the claim. Borrowers were not part of the pre-identified class of Corinthian Colleges for whom approval was provided in advance. Borrowers did not make an allegation or provide sufficient evidence that the institution violated an applicable state law. For example, borrowers who submitted a claim stating that their teacher was unfair or that they have not found a job they like are not eligible for relief under the applicable BDR provision. The decisions issued this week include thousands of claims that were effectively denied by the prior administration but were left behind for this administration to notify borrowers. For context, the prior administration’s final BDR report had indicated approximately 40% of pending claims at that point in time were deemed ineligible. Students deemed ineligible for relief, who have loans held by the Department, will have any interest accrued on their loan waived from the date their claim was submitted. This is the second robust adjudication process put in place by this administration to address pending claims. As many will recall, the Department first began adjudicating BDR claims in 2017 but was stopped by a California court based on technical, legal questions arising from a data-sharing agreement within the federal government. The Department appealed the court’s decision, but when it became obvious that the court was not going to move quickly, the Department began to develop the new methodology released today for adjudicating claims."

The proposed regulations are the result of historic consensus the Department reached during negotiated rulemaking earlier this year. Secretary DeVos said regarding the proposed TEACH Grants update, ""This proposed rule ensures educators who received TEACH Grants and who are meeting their service requirements do not have their grants converted to loans improperly or as a result of confusing bureaucratic paperwork. This new rule also recognizes, for the first time, the vital contributions of elementary school educators, whose service was not included in earlier TEACH Grant regulations."" The proposed regulations on TEACH Grants include important changes that will eliminate burdensome certification and annual reporting requirements, eliminate the possibility that a missed paperwork deadline will result in thousands of dollars in student loan debt for a teacher, and create opportunities and processes for resolving grants that were incorrectly converted to loans. These proposed regulations also expand access to TEACH Grants to elementary school educators who teach in high-need areas. The proposed regulations also respond to the Supreme Court ruling in Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer [1] to ensure that individuals and institutions are not forced to choose between upholding their deeply-held faith or participating in federal funding programs. ""Faith-based institutions should not have to worry about losing access to federal programs due to their faith,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""These new rules will ensure a level playing field and will guarantee that individuals and institutions can continue to practice their faith and adhere to their values without losing the federal funding opportunities otherwise available to others."" The proposed regulations make it clear that the Department cannot discriminate against otherwise eligible students and faith-based entities by disqualifying them from Title IV, Higher Education Act (HEA) programs solely because of their religious beliefs or status. The proposed revisions guard against such discrimination and make clear that Title IV, HEA programs remain available to all eligible entities and students regardless of their religious status or beliefs. The Department intends to publish final regulations by no later than November 1, 2020, so that they will be effective July 1, 2021. [1] 137 S. Ct. 2012 (2017)."

She detailed both what FSA can and is doing now, including continued enhancements to customer service through the transformative myStudentAid app, and what requires the action of others, including improving how FSA is structured and governed. ""From submitting the FAFSA® to submitting payments; from seeing what a loan will cost over time to participating in exit counseling—we are updating everything,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""And we're doing it so that students are better informed borrowers. So that students will be able to see what they owe, what they will owe, what ways they can repay what they owe, and acknowledge all of that each year before they borrow any more. Surprisingly, students will be able to do that for the first time ever. And if they do have questions—we know they do—they will be able to ask Aidan ."" Aidan, the new chatbot, will be able to answer many of the routine questions borrowers have about their loans including how to make a payment and what types of repayment plans for which they might qualify. If Aidan doesn't have the answer, he can show customers where to find it. To help FSA better achieve its mission, Secretary DeVos also discussed structural changes she believes would improve operations and better serve students, including that FSA become ""a standalone entity, wholly and entirely separate from the U.S. Department of Education."" Such reforms are needed to better manage what has become the nation's largest lender, with nearly $1.6 trillion in outstanding loans. Assessing the drawbacks of FSA's current organizational structure, Secretary DeVos said, ""FSA simply cannot satisfy the ever-changing political whims of Washington."" The new proposed leadership model for FSA ""is truly independent from interference, political or otherwise."" Since taking office, Secretary DeVos has made clear that if FSA is going to be the nation's largest private lender, it needs to function like a 21st century ""world-class financial institution"" that treats borrowers like the customers that they are. ""We can provide students with better information,"" she concluded. ""We can provide students with better products. We can ignore the Siren songs of easy—very expensive and very unfair—fixes. We can get this right for students, and for our country."" A full transcript of the remarks is below. Thank you for that introduction, Mark Brown. And let me add what a pleasure it has been having you on our team. You bring important focus, vision, and discipline to the job, and I'm so pleased to begin to see the results of your leadership. You ensure we ""aim high"" every day, General. I'm pleased to be back at this conference with people who work with and for students every day. Your role is crucial. You're with students in times of joy and sorrow as they navigate formative years. Students rely on you, and you make significant impacts on their lifelong learning journeys. So, let me thank you for all you do to put students first. Federal Student Aid was established in 1965 to do just that. To come alongside students who lack financial resources to pursue higher education. To expand access to learning for those who aren't wealthy, powerful, or well-connected. That's been the mission of federal student aid programs since the beginning. But students don't pursue higher education in the same way they did back then—more than 50 years ago. And students don't pay for higher education like they did then, either. Today, they use different financial instruments in a different, constantly iterating economy. At last year's conference, I urged everyone to rethink student lending. And with the limited tools Congress gave us, we are rethinking FSA. The financial aid process must be modern, streamlined, and simply easier for students—and for you. That's how processes are in every other area of finance. Think about how you pay for your car. Or how you pay for your home. Simplicity is commonplace in the private sector. I know a thing or two about that, as do many others on our team who haven't spent a lot of time working in government. Some might question the presence of outsiders in this space, but, as it's been said, maybe what students need is someone who doesn't yet know all the things you ""can't do."" So, we are modernizing FSA's infrastructure and totally revamping the way we connect with students. Last year, we called this initiative ""NextGen."" This year, ""NextGen"" is ""NowGen."" General Brown will talk about this in greater detail later. So, let me just say this: we are undertaking a rigorous transformation of government services, bringing everything together behind one, digital gateway. Now, this isn't exciting in the private sector—in fact, it's expected. But for government services, our long-overdue updates are well ahead of the curve. No longer will students have to sift through countless websites; there will be one website. No longer will students have to dial wrong numbers, be transferred to different ones, and then sit on hold indefinitely; there will be one phone number. No longer will students have to complete their FAFSA® tethered to a desktop; now, students can start on their tablet, continue on their phone while commuting to work…and complete it on any one of their devices—including through the new myStudentAid mobile app. You'll remember we exceeded expectations when we unveiled it last year. In the app, students will now have more real-time and transparent information with which to plan for their education. From submitting the FAFSA® to submitting payments; from seeing what a loan will cost over time to participating in exit counseling—we are updating everything. And we're doing it so that students are better informed borrowers. So that students will be able to see what they owe, what they will owe, what ways they can repay what they owe, and acknowledge all of that each year before they borrow any more. Surprisingly, students will be able to do that for the first time ever. And if they do have questions—we know they do—they will be able to ask Aidan . Aidan isn't the only way we're empowering students with relevant, accessible, and actionable information. Our transformative updates to the College Scorecard empower students to seamlessly access more information about their education than ever before. For the first time, students will be able to find data on debt and potential earnings by field of study. For example, if a student wants to study psychology, he can see what other graduates in the field are earning and how much debt they took on to earn that degree from different institutions. And for the first time, College Scorecard offers information on all types of higher education options including traditional degrees, two-year programs, certificates, apprenticeships, and even some graduate programs. Think about the power of having relevant and accessible information, and how having that data facilitates more informed decision-making. That's important. But implementing each of these tactical measures still isn't enough for FSA to truly ""sponsor the American mind."" FSA's mission is to serve students and their families, but its structure is set up to serve politicians and their policies. As it's been said, no one can serve two masters. Consider that initially the federal government's role in student lending was just a guarantor, and a lender of last resort. Congress never set up the U.S. Department of Education to be a bank, nor did it define the Secretary of Education as the nation's ""top banker."" But that's effectively what Congress expects based on its policies. FSA's portfolio has skyrocketed at more than 8 percent annual growth on average since 2010—almost four times faster than economic growth. And today, FSA holds more than $1.5 trillion in outstanding loans to 42 million borrowers. That portfolio makes Federal Student Aid bigger than Bank of America, bigger than J.P. Morgan, bigger than Capital One. Indeed, it represents the country's biggest consumer lender. Now consider this government monopoly was coupled with each new political project of each new Congress. Every couple of years, FSA—and the students it serves—have been pulled in a new political direction. Just look at today's parade of repayment options, forgiveness plans, unlimited lending, and complex rules that FSA—and you—have been asked to implement, and then explain to students and their families. Eight different repayment plans, five of which are income driven, each with different eligibility requirements. More than 30 variations of deferment and forbearance options. Fourteen forgiveness options. And 11 different servicers, all with totally separate websites and platforms, phone numbers, and forms. Is it any wonder students are having bad experiences? Students are borrowing tens of thousands of dollars, but many do not understand the implications of that debt. Is it any surprise, then, that both principal and interest are currently being paid down for only one in four loans? Nearly 11 million borrowers have loans that are delinquent or in default? And 43 percent of all loans are considered ""in distress""? It can only lead you to the conclusion that FSA is ""in distress."" Since the federal government inserted itself everywhere in student lending, everything has become more cumbersome and more confusing for everyone. And while everything about our world has changed, everything about Federal Student Aid's structure and governance has stayed the same. Congress might've created the first financial aid program, but it set in motion an untamed beast. Congress asked FSA to implement each new program and each new plan, with the same old infrastructure, and no common-sense governance model. FSA simply cannot satisfy the ever-changing political whims of Washington. In its current form—which no one likely ever imagined—it cannot fulfill its mission. Now, I'm not so sure the federal government should monopolize student lending, but if it does—and, for now, it essentially does—then it must provide services on par with world-class financial firms. And that starts with acting like a world-class financial firm. One that is truly independent from interference, political or otherwise. One that puts its customers—students and their families—at the center of everything. One that focuses on and achieves its mission. One has to wonder: Why isn't FSA a standalone government corporation, run by a professional, expert, and apolitical Board of Governors? A separate FSA would be better positioned to deliver world-class service to students and their families as they finance higher education. It would manage the student loan portfolio and work to secure its financial strength and sustainability. And it would do all the things it's been charged to do—only far better. This notion doesn't come out of ""left field."" You've all been attuned to it for some time. Through the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators, you all have offered some useful insights. NASFAA found that while Federal Student Aid is ranked for total assets alongside the country's biggest banks, the similarities end there. Banks rely on boards of directors for strategic direction and oversight. FSA has no such thing. This is an idea that warrants far more discussion. We should be discussing whether FSA would be stronger as a standalone entity—wholly and entirely separate from the U.S. Department of Education. We should be talking about the benefits of professional, experienced leadership who, as in the private sector, would be responsible for setting strategy for FSA, for overseeing the management of the loan portfolio, for ensuring institutions hold up their end of the bargain, and for reporting to Congress. To be clear, I don't think such an agency should look like another CFPB. Nor should it be a return to FFEL. And it would not report to the Secretary of Education. Under this scenario we're discussing, Federal Student Aid would be empowered to focus on its mission—partnering with institutions and all of you to serve students and their families. At the same time, students must be responsible consumers of education, seriously committed to their own success. They need to have the best possible tools, data, advice, and support. And they need to be free to learn. We can provide students with better information. We can provide students with better products. We can ignore the Siren songs of easy—very expensive and very unfair—fixes. We can get this right for students, and for our country. President Trump and this Administration are committed to transforming Federal Student Aid for students. Congress needs to come alongside us to make this happen. We live in some of the most exciting and opportunity-filled times ever. As our country's horizons are ever-broadening, so too is American imagination, American ingenuity, and American achievement. So, let's renew our commitment—each and every day—to each and every student's success. Thank you."

The Opportunity Zones priority will allow the Department to focus on grantees that do their work in an Opportunity Zone, grantees that are located in an Opportunity Zone, and grantees that will increase the impact of each federal dollar by partnering with a Qualified Opportunity Fund. ""We want to ensure federal dollars have the maximum positive impact on the students and communities that need it most,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""Through the Opportunity Zones priority, we can focus our discretionary resources on projects that will spur innovative approaches to education in areas of the country that are all too often left behind. I am grateful to the President for establishing Opportunity Zones and for his commitment to fighting for every student, no matter their ZIP Code, to have access to the education that works for them."" Last fiscal year, the Department encouraged projects in nine grant competitions to support students in Opportunity Zones. Of the 238 grants funded through these competitions, more than half indicated in their applications that their projects were aligned with the Opportunity Zones initiative. In the four 2019 competitions that either provided bonus points or established a separate competition track for applicants proposing to serve Opportunity Zones, the Department supported 50 grants, awarding over $30 million to support States, school districts, and other organizations working to improve educational outcomes in Opportunity Zones. In the State Charter School Facilities Incentive Grants Program, the Department awarded $6 million to the Indiana Department of Education to enhance an existing per-pupil facilities aid program for charter schools, with a focus on charter schools located in Opportunity Zones. In the Charter School Developers program, the Department made three new awards totaling $1.1 million to support the opening and expansion of charter schools in Opportunity Zones. Under the Perkins Innovation and Modernization program, the Department made nine awards totaling $1.5 million to support grants in Opportunity Zones to improve Career and Technical Education program effectiveness and alignment. In the School Climate Transformation Grant Program, the Department made 37 awards totaling $23 million to school districts overlapping with Opportunity Zones to support schools implementing a multi-tiered system of support for improving school climate. Governors have selected over 8,700 Opportunity Zones nationwide with diverse characteristics. Opportunity Zones are economically distressed, with substantially higher rates of unemployment, lower rates of educational attainment, lower median household income, and higher poverty rates, on average, than the rest of the nation. While ensuring its programs support high-quality projects that serve diverse urban and rural communities, the Department can use this priority amplify its work to efficiently target funds to these economically distressed areas."

Thanks to the groundbreaking redesign of the College Scorecard, students can now find customized, accessible, and relevant data on potential debt and earnings based on fields of study (including for 2-year programs, 4-year degrees, certificate programs, and some graduate programs), graduation rates, and even apprenticeships. This total Scorecard ""rethink,"" as Secretary DeVos says, builds on President Trump's Executive Order on Improving Free Inquiry, Transparency, and Accountability at Colleges and Universities and will truly help students find the right fit for them. ""Every student is unique,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""What they study, as well as when, where, and how they chose to pursue their education will impact their future. Students know this instinctively. That's why we worked to deliver a product that is customizable and transparent—a tool that provides real information students need to make informed, personalized decisions about their education. The Scorecard also ensures students can make apples-to-apples comparisons by providing the same data about all of the programs a student might be considering without regard to the type of school."" For the first time ever, students will now have access to information on the median earnings and median debt of a school's graduates, based on their chosen field of study. That means, for example, a student interested in studying engineering can now compare outcomes, such as first-year earnings and student loan debt, among engineering programs within an institution and among those offered at other schools. Students will be able to see if a career and technical education program at a two-year institution might generate a higher return on investment than a more traditional program at a four-year institution. Rather than having to rely on reputation-based rankings, the Scorecard will also allow students to choose a program based on the outcomes of students who have already completed that program. Previously, Scorecard users could only see the median earnings and median debt at the institutional level, which is a fairly meaningless metric given the diversity of programs and outcomes at any given single school. The Scorecard now shows the range of earnings among the various programs an institution offers. The Scorecard also builds upon prior updates to include all students, including transfer and part-time students, to provide comprehensive data on graduation rates. Instead of focusing only on first-time, full-time student graduation rates, the Scorecard allows users to calculate graduation rates whether they are full-time, part-time, first-time, or transfer students. With the click of a button, users can see the likelihood of graduation for students like them. ""This update to College Scorecard is truly a transformative one that places a strong emphasis on transparency,"" said Assistant Secretary for Planning, Evaluation, and Policy Development James Blew. ""I look forward to seeing how students, parents, and researchers alike use this new data to inform decision-making."" The Scorecard's search function in general is more intuitive and dynamic than before, allowing prospective students to more easily find and compare schools that meet their needs. Students and their parents can now search for schools by acceptance rate, ACT/SAT scores, and location (including a ""close to me"" feature). Today's updates build on the improvements announced earlier this year , which involved expanding the College Scorecard to include information on 2,100 certificate-granting institutions. The Secretary has encouraged all students to ""Rethink Education"" and consider the multitude of education options that can lead to success upon graduation. To visit the College Scorecard, go to https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/ or click on the College Scorecard link in the myStudentAid mobile app. In addition to its consumer website that highlights a subset of its available data, College Scorecard continues to make over 2,000 data elements available to developers, researchers, and others through an application program interface (API)."

This year’s slate includes six new members and one re-appointed member. The appointees’ terms officially began on Oct. 1, 2019, and will end on Sept. 30, 2023. The appointees will help set policy for the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) , also known as the Nation's Report Card. NAEP offers to the public and to education policymakers at the national, state and local levels, objective data on student performance in nearly a dozen subjects. The information NAEP provides helps education stakeholders evaluate the progress of American education. The 26-member nonpartisan, independent Governing Board determines the subjects and content of NAEP tests, sets the achievement levels for reporting and publicly releases the results. “It is a privilege to welcome this diverse and esteemed group of leaders to the National Assessment Governing Board this year,” said Secretary DeVos. “Their collective expertise will be a tremendous asset to the Board as it continues the important work of measuring student achievement in the United States. The troubling results in this year’s Nation’s Report Card show our nation has a long way to go in closing the achievement gap and ensuring all students have access to an education that unlocks their full potential.” The appointees and their roles on the Board are listed below: Alberto Carvalho, local school superintendent: Carvalho joined the Governing Board in 2015. He leads the nation’s fourth largest school system as superintendent of Miami-Dade County Public Schools (M-DCPS). During his tenure, M-DCPS has become one of the nation’s highest-performing urban school systems, receiving systemwide accreditation from AdvancEd in 2014. Frank Edelblut, chief state school officer: Edelblut is the commissioner of the New Hampshire Department of Education. In his role, he serves on a number of boards, including as a trustee for the University System of New Hampshire, as an ex-officio trustee for the Community College System of New Hampshire, and as a member of the New Hampshire Higher Education Commission. Edelblut previously was a Republican member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, where he served on the Finance Committee, Special Committee on Pensions, and the Child and Family Law Committee. Eric Hanushek, testing & measurement expert: Hanushek is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution of Stanford University in Stanford, Calif. He is a recognized leader in the economic analysis of education issues and has authored numerous widely-cited studies on the effects of class- size reduction, school accountability, teacher effectiveness, and other topics. Reginald McGregor, business representative: McGregor is the manager of engineering employee development and STEM outreach in the Research & Technology Strategy Group at Rolls-Royce Corporation in Indianapolis. He is also the president of the Metropolitan School District of Lawrence Township Board of Education. Martin West, state school board member: West is a member of the Massachusetts Board of Elementary and Secondary Education, professor of education at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, a faculty research fellow at the National Bureau of Economic Research, and editor-in-chief of Education Next . He is also deputy director of the Program on Education Policy and Governance at Harvard’s Kennedy School. Grover J. “Russ” Whitehurst, curriculum specialist: Whitehurst is the former director of the Brown Center on Education Policy and former senior fellow in Economic Studies at the Brookings Institution, where he conducted influential research on the impacts of curriculum materials on student achievement. As the founding director of the Institute of Education Sciences at the U.S. Department of Education, Whitehurst is widely acknowledged to have had a transforming effect on the rigor and relevance of education research. Carey Wright, chief state school officer: Wright is the state superintendent of education for Mississippi. Under her leadership, Mississippi has initiated education reforms that have resulted in unprecedented academic success and rising student achievement. In 2018, Quality Counts recognized Mississippi as one of the five most improved states in the nation. “We are thrilled to welcome these new members to the National Assessment Governing Board, where they will join an exceptional group of leaders with a strong tradition of serving the nation and their communities and a strong commitment to improving the nation’s understanding of student progress,” said Lesley Muldoon, executive director of the National Assessment Governing Board. Secretary DeVos will appoint three additional members to the 26-member Governing Board for the 2019-2023 term: a curriculum specialist, general public representative, and a 12th-grade teacher."

""This Administration continues to make strategic investments in STEM education and is working to ensure that all Americans access to high-quality STEM education no matter where they are in their life-long learning journeys,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. ""I'm thankful to the President for his leadership on this issue and his commitment to the success of all of America's students."" These funds deliver on the Administration's promise to support STEM education, as well as on the overall goals of the five-year federal STEM education strategic plan entitled Charting A Course For Success: America's Strategy for STEM Education . The Department continued to support the Plan's vision for a future where all Americans will have lifelong access to high-quality STEM education and the United States will be the global leader in STEM literacy, innovation, and employment. Of the overall investment, almost $345 million supported continuing the work of current grants that support STEM activities that have demonstrated that they meet all applicable grant requirements, including making substantial progress towards fulfilling the aims of their project proposals. These funds will be used to prepare the STEM teacher corps , provide graduate student fellowships in areas of national need, increase the number of low-income students who are prepared to enter and succeed in postsecondary education, and support state efforts to expand and improve the transition of high school Career and Technical Education (CTE) Students to postsecondary education and employment through apprenticeships, among other areas. In addition to the millions that went to continue past investments, the Department had the following programs (discretionary and research) in Fiscal Year 2019 that supported roughly $200 million in new awards that include STEM activities: Alaska Native Education Equity Program – $1.7 Million Braille Training (Rehabilitation Services Demonstrations and Training) – $340,000 College Assistance Migrant Program (CAMP) – $4.7 Million Comprehensive Centers Program – $5 Million Education Innovation and Research (EIR) – $78 million Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs (State Grants) (GEAR-UP) – $30.3 Million Graduate Assistance in Areas of National Need (GAANN) – $2.8 Million Education Research Grants Program – $5 Million National Center for Special Education Research (NCSER) Program Special Education Research Grants Program – $2 Million Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program – $5 Million Jacob K. Javits Gifted and Talented Students Education Program – $4 Million Minority Science and Engineering Improvement Program (MSEIP) – $6 Million Perkins Innovation & Modernization Grant Program – $1.5 Million Supporting Effective Educator Development (SEED) – $8.4 Million Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) – $24 Million TRIO – $19 Million (Of the eight TRIO programs, these funds are for Talent Search, Upward Bound Math-Science, and Ronald E. McNair Postbaccalaureate Achievement.) Finally, the Department's investments in 2019 also included almost $100 million in funds to support projects with a focus on Computer Science. In addition to the Department's discretionary grants portfolio, the Department supports STEM via its formula and federal student aid support.

The Secretary also announced the Department will extend the lookback period of eligibility for closed school discharges for students who attended another 24 Dream Center schools that closed in December 2018. ""The Department is committed to holding institutions and accreditors accountable to the students they serve,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. ""In this instance, students were failed and deserve to be made whole. By canceling these students' loans and restoring their Pell eligibility, as well as extending the closed school discharge period, we hope that these impacted students will now have the tools and resources they need to complete their education."" More than 1,500 borrowers who attended the Art Institute of Colorado or the Illinois Institute of Art will have an estimated 4,000 loans canceled. The decision to cancel student loans and restore Pell Grant eligibility comes because students were harmed by the Higher Learning Commission's classification of the institutions in a newly developed and improperly defined accreditation status after January 20, 2018. The Department is concerned that the Art Institute of Colorado and the Illinois Institute of Art were actually fully accredited from January 20, 2018, until their closings at the end of the year. Because HLC has required these two schools to note on student transcripts that credits and degrees earned during this period are from a non-accredited institution, students have been harmed as they seek transfer credit and employment elsewhere. The extension of the closed school discharge lookback period to June 29, 2018, will help approximately 300 additional borrowers. Typically, students who were enrolled when a school closes or who withdrew not more than 120 days before the school closed can have their federal student loans from that school forgiven if they meet certain requirements. That 120-day window can be extended in exceptional circumstances at the discretion of the Secretary. Borrowers who believe they qualify for the cancellation or closed school loan discharge should ensure that their federal student loan servicer has their current email address and mailing address on file in order to allow for timely communication. The Department is notifying federal student loan servicers of this decision. Servicers will also send borrowers impacted by the closed school discharge extension a notification and an application for discharge. Borrowers who do not qualify for a cancellation or a closed school discharge, but who are struggling to make student loan payments, should contact their student loan servicer to discuss repayment options. Information for students, including a list of impacted schools, is available at StudentAid.gov/about/announcements/dceh-schools.

Results for America provides a snapshot of how federal agencies are building and using evidence and data to get better results for young people, their families, and communities. Among nine federal agencies examined, the Department of Education ranked third on the Federal Standard of Excellence, with a total score of 73 points out of a possible 100. The Department of Education received the highest possible scores for leadership, related to federal agencies designating key personnel to lead evidence and data efforts, as well as common evidence standards, which examines how federal agencies classify evidence for use in research and funding decisions. Notably, Results for America recognized the Department for the strong use of evidence when allocating funds in competitive grant programs. “Evidence and data allow us to see how, when, and where federal dollars can have the greatest positive impact on students,” said Mark Schneider, director of the Institute of Education Sciences (IES). He added, “The nation invests strongly in education, and our goal is to make sure that students and taxpayers see excellent returns on that investment. The Department and IES are leading the charge to harness the right data to make strategic decisions.” ""The U.S. Department of Education is among the federal agencies leading the way in using evidence and data to improve its efficiency and effectiveness,"" said Jed Herrmann, vice president of state and federal policy implementation at Results for America. ""We are encouraged by the Department's ongoing use of evaluation to invest taxpayer dollars in what works."" Results for America noted that the Department “used a consistent evidence framework for its research and funding decisions, including the prioritization of evidence in its largest competitive grant programs.” Results for America’s full report on the Department of Education is available here ."

""These final regulations demonstrate our commitment to working with student, State, employer, and institutional representatives to develop sound policies that serve the best interests of students,” said Secretary DeVos. “These reforms are necessary to bring higher education into the current century, to be more responsive to the needs of students, and to reduce the skyrocketing cost of higher education.” The regulations also align accountability requirements with an institution’s mission rather than paperwork and process and seek to clarify that all institutional accreditors are held to the same standards by the Department of Education. As a result, students should not face barriers to career entry and mobility, or to continuing education, based solely on which accreditor oversees the school they attended. Secretary DeVos continued, “As we have done since the beginning of this Administration, we asked ourselves and our negotiating partners to consider why we do the things we do, and if there might be a better way moving forward. We rejected the idea that one-size-fits-all solutions make sense in a world where education needs continue to evolve in our dynamic economy. And we ended the stranglehold that a system designed when people traveled by horse and buggy continued to have on institutions. Accreditation has played a role in the bloat that has taken place in higher education administration, and it is time to right size bureaucracy and allow institutions to redirect their resources to students and teaching.” The State Authorization of Distance and Correspondence Education regulations have also been updated and streamlined. The revisions make clear an institution’s responsibilities and the role of State reciprocity agreements while ensuring students have the information they need to make informed decisions. States that join a reciprocity agreement can no longer layer additional State higher education authorization requirements on institutions that participate but can continue to apply other State laws and regulations that apply to all entities doing business in a State. The final regulations will provide students with more options to pursue a higher education credential of value, transfer credits between institutions, and qualify for career advancement. For example, these regulations: Level the playing field by ending unfounded distinctions between accreditors based on the geographic area in which they perform their work Create opportunities for new accreditors that give priority to student needs and outcomes rather than academic traditions that primarily benefit faculty Counter the inclination of faculty, professional societies, and licensing boards to rachet up the entry level postsecondary credential required to work in certain occupations Enable students and institutions to leverage state-of-the art facilities maintained by companies, unions, and trade associations – as well as the expertise of the subject matter experts these organizations employ – to improve educational quality and outcomes and reduce the cost of providing education to students in areas where equipment is expensive and technology evolves rapidly Enable more institutions, including rural institutions, to provide low-cost or no-cost dual enrollment opportunities to students while still in high school Speed up approval of new programs and curricular changes to ensure that what students learn in school keeps pace with what employers demand in the workplace Empower employers to help engage more actively in program development and review Inform student choice by helping students determine which programs are mostly likely to prepare them to meet the licensure or certification requirements in certain occupations Update Department rules to ensure that students who elect to complete their credential abroad have the opportunity to complete part of their program in the U.S. or to take courses offered by other institutions in the country in which they are enrolled The regulations will take effect on July 1, 2020, with the exception of select provisions necessary to implement new timelines for recognition of accrediting agencies.

The Department will also soon publish proposed rules based on the consensus agreements reached on topics related to distance education and innovation, as well as TEACH grants and the equitable treatment of faith-based institutions."

The results are, frankly, devastating. This country is in a student achievement crisis, and over the past decade it has continued to worsen, especially for our most vulnerable students. ""Two out of three of our nation’s children aren’t proficient readers. In fact, fourth grade reading declined in 17 states and eighth grade reading declined in 31. The gap between the highest and lowest performing students is widening, despite $1 trillion in Federal spending over 40 years designated specifically to help close it. ""This must be America’s wake-up call. We cannot abide these poor results any longer. We can neither excuse them away nor simply throw more money at the problem. ""This Administration has a transformational plan to help America’s forgotten students escape failing schools. By expanding education freedom, students can break out of the one-size-fits all system and learn in the ways that will unlock their full potential. They deserve it. Parents demand it. And, it’s the only way to bring about the change our country desperately needs.

Opportunity Scholarship Program (DCOSP) and to call on Congress to act immediately on its reauthorization. “The D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program is proof that empowering parents and students with freedom to choose their education works,” said Secretary DeVos. “As Congress considers reauthorization of this program, its members should listen to the life-changing success stories of those who received scholarships. All students deserve the freedom to find the right fit.” Since its enactment, DCOSP has helped more than 10,000 students in the District of Columbia find a school that best fits their needs. Parents and students who have benefitted from DCOSP recounted their education freedom success stories at today’s event. Michael White, a D.C. Opportunity Scholarship recipient who attends Cornerstone Schools, made the case for Education Freedom : “It is the fundamental belief that no matter what zip code you live in, no matter what street you live on, no matter where you are in your life, that you should have the ability to have a quality education and that your family should decide where exactly you go to school.” Shaniya Vereene, a senior at Cornerstone, said of her experience with DCOSP , “The Opportunity Scholarship Program relieves my family and I of financial distress, and allows me to focus more on my education. Thanks to the OSP, I have a better education and more financial freedom.” Ninety-four percent of D.C. parents who use the scholarships for their children are happy with their decision to pursue education freedom. Speaking about DCOSP, Deborah Ngongang, a mother whose four children benefited from the scholarship, explained, “I fight for this program because I know how much it means.” She spoke of her daughter’s experience, saying “She was accepted to three different schools, but I chose Emerson because it was a small school. And guess what? Somebody found her at Emerson doing a speech, and she is on the debate team…[and she goes to] law camp…She’s going to be a great lawyer; I can guarantee you that.” Carmen Jean-Baptiste, another parent of DCOSP recipients, noted how important it is for parents and students to work to protect the program and encouraged students to make the most of their opportunity. “You all who are here, continue to fight, continue to take advantage of the education… The opportunity scholarship is here… to fulfill your dream… because you all are our future.” Members of Congress also came to the Department to celebrate the success of DCOSP and encourage their colleagues to reauthorize the program. SOAR Act authorization of DCOSP expired Sept. 30, 2019. A continuing resolution that funds the program temporarily will expire Nov. 21, 2019. Senator Ron Johnson, who reintroduced the SOAR Act this year and is leading the charge on reauthorization, said , “The reason we’re here trying to reauthorize [DCOSP], and, by the way, we’re introducing a permanent reauthorization…and I hope we can pass this quickly and unanimously, so that no child in America, and certainly no child in D.C. ever has the devastating realization that they don’t have the freedom and opportunity to choose a school that works for them.” Congresswoman Virginia Foxx, the ranking member of the House Committee on Education and Labor, added , “We know education choice is powerful. Families should have the opportunity to make informed decisions that work for them and their individual needs rather than be forced to accept a one-size-fits-all government mandate. The DCOSP shows that scholarships will work, and that choice will work.” Congressman Andy Harris addressed students , “As you know, where you go to school makes a big difference. This program means wherever you call home, you are eligible to go to a school where you will succeed, where you will have a chance to be whatever you want to be, and don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.” To counter critics of the program, Congressman Ralph Norman asked , “What’s wrong with choice? If you’ve got money, you can pay for your child to get tutored, you can pay for your child to go to a private school, you can pay for your child to be in an establishment zip code here in Washington, D.C. But what about those who can’t afford it? That’s who we want to serve, everybody.” D.C.

The updates reflect changes to the statutory provisions governing equitable services by ESSA, emphasize collaboration and consultation between public and private school officials to provide needed services to eligible students, and consolidate information previously spread across multiple documents. Updated topics include allowable uses of funds, consultation between public and private school officials, obligation of funds to ensure services occur in a timely manner, carryover of unobligated funds to provide services in the next year, and calculation of the share of Title I funds available for equitable services. Two important clarifying topics include: The permissibility of inter-district pooling of Title I funds to provide equitable services The permissibility of religious organizations serving as third-party contractors to provide equitable services Pooling of Title I funds across districts does not change the total amount of funds generated for Title I equitable services, and it can only occur when agreed upon by private school officials and LEAs. Clarifying the flexibility to allow such a practice helps ensure that the lowest-achieving students in a group of schools receive Title I services, reduces burden on LEAs and private school officials, and promotes efficiency through the use of shared services. The updates also clarify the permissibility of religious organizations serving as third-party contractors to provide equitable services. This is consistent with the Secretary's March 11, 2019, letter to Congress in which she stated that the Department would no longer enforce a ban on LEAs from contracting with religious organizations to provide equitable services in light of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer . Secretary DeVos stated, ""We are pleased to support public and private school stakeholders who implement Title I equitable services. The Department is responding to questions from education leaders across the nation with direct answers that will aid them in delivering equitable services to students in need."" The Department's process reflects the additional transparency and accessibility focus of President Trump's recent Executive Order. A draft of the Department's updated document received over 500 comments from the public, which informed the final product. The Department also published a corresponding Summary Response to Public Comments , which provides a brief summary of significant changes and/or additions between the draft updated document published in the spring and the final version published on Oct. 7, 2019."

Currently, more than 70% of Opportunity Zones do not have a public charter school option available to students. One-fifth of Opportunity Zone residents lack a high school diploma. By creating and expanding high-quality public charter schools in Opportunity Zones, more families living in economically distressed communities will have access to additional education options that might better meet their child's needs. ""Access to high-quality, innovative education options is fundamental to the long-term success of not only students but also entire communities,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""The focus on opening charter schools in designated Opportunity Zones will have a long-lasting impact, and I'm looking forward to seeing how charter school leaders, nonprofit organizations, and others utilize the Qualified Opportunity Fund to invest in students and improve outcomes."" The Department awarded a new contract to Leed Management Consulting, Inc., of Silver Spring, Maryland, to conduct outreach to current and prospective high-quality charter operators, develop resources to assist with opening high-quality charter schools and serving students living in economically-distressed communities, and provide technical assistance to entities looking to create and expand high-quality charter schools in Opportunity Zones through the use of Qualified Opportunity Funds. The Department's Charter Schools Program awards funding on a competitive basis. In 2019, the Department of Education awarded more than $3.8 million in new funding to applicants serving Qualified Opportunity Zones, after adding a competitive preference priority in two of its Charter Schools Program grant competitions (Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) numbers 84.282B and 84.282E). Signed into law by President Donald J. Trump in 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act established Opportunity Zones and Qualified Opportunity Funds to incentivize investment in economically distressed areas across the United States by providing tax benefits to investors in order to spur economic development and job creation. A Qualified Opportunity Fund is an investment vehicle which is organized for the purpose of investing in Opportunity Zone(s). (See here for more.)"

The U.S. Department of Education made the awards under four grant programs, which support recommendations identified in the final report issued by the Federal Commission on School Safety. ""Our nation's schools must be safe places to learn, where students feel connected and supported,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""These grants allow local leaders to tailor their approach to school safety and mental health in ways that meet their students' individual needs and their particular school's unique challenges."" The four grant programs are as follows: The Trauma Recovery Demonstration Grant Program provides more than $6.7 million to five states -- Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii, Louisiana, and Nevada -- to fund model programs enabling students from low-income families who have experienced trauma that negatively affects their educational experience to access trauma-specific mental health services from their choice of provider in order to best meet their needs. The Mental Health Demonstration Grant Program provides $11 million to 27 State education agencies and school districts to support innovative partnerships to train and deploy school-based mental health service providers in schools. The purpose is to expand the pipeline of high-quality, trained professionals to address shortages of mental health services in high-need schools and to provide supports that encompass social and emotional learning, mental wellness, resilience, and positive connections between students and adults. Project Prevent provides more than $11.3 million to 15 school districts to increase their capacity to assist schools in communities with pervasive violence. These grants will enable schools to identify, assess, and serve students exposed to pervasive violence, provide mental health services for related trauma or anxiety, support conflict resolution programs, and implement other school-based violence prevention strategies in order to break the cycle of violence in these communities. The School Climate Transformation Grant Program provides $42.4 million to 69 school districts to help develop, enhance, or expand systems of support for, and technical assistance to, schools implementing a multi-tiered system of support for improving school climate. The program focuses on supporting communities that may uniquely benefit from implementing a multi-tiered system of support, including districts serving rural areas and/or members of a federally recognized Tribe, and districts located in a Qualified Opportunity Zone."

These grants will help foster meaningful professional development opportunities, especially in the often-lacking areas of STEM and computer science-focused training."" To be eligible, an applicant must form a partnership that includes a high-need school district, an IHE, and a program of education within a partner institution. Partnerships may also include nonprofit organizations. Over two-thirds of the funded projects are specifically designed to better prepare teachers for teaching STEM and computer science, including innovative ideas such as enabling teachers to earn micro-credentials in the field of computer science. Nearly half of the funded projects will take place in a Qualified Opportunity Zone (see here for more about Opportunity Zones.) The TQP program is authorized under Title II of the Higher Education Act with the purpose of improving student achievement, elevating the quality of the teacher workforce by enhancing preparation of prospective teachers and professional development of new teachers, and recruiting highly qualified individuals into the teacher workforce.

The I&M; Grant is designed to test new ideas to help prepare students for success in the workforce by identifying, supporting, and evaluating evidence-based strategies for improving CTE. The grants are also designed to ensure workforce skills taught in CTE programs funded under Perkins V align with local labor market needs. Grantees will create, develop, implement, replicate, or scale evidence-based innovations that modernize CTE, increase program effectiveness and alignment, and improve student outcomes. Grant funds under this competition may be used for a broad range of approaches including designing new courses, building capacity in computer science and coding, creating work-based learning opportunities for students, and integrating science and math content in applied courses. ""We know that access to high-quality Career and Technical Education options can open up new pathways to success for students,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. ""It's gratifying to see each of these grantees rethinking education and modernizing workforce training in their communities to ensure students have the skills they need for in-demand, high-paying jobs."" In July 2018, President Trump signed into law the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act (Perkins V), the federal government's principal source of funding for career and technical education (CTE). The program provides nearly $1.3 billion to states, school districts, and community colleges every year, of which the I&M; Grant is a part. Of the 64 eligible applications reviewed for this competition, nine grant recipients received the highest ranking from panels made up of reviewers with expertise in CTE, alignment of CTE programs to address labor market needs, and STEM. Three of the funded projects are serving rural communities, a priority because rural communities often have fewer resources and less ability to innovate in the ways that the I&M; grants encourage.

Students and parents who submit a FAFSA form can view their Student Aid Report (SAR) via the mobile app's myFAFSA feature. The SAR contains the Expected Family Contribution, which is the number that schools use to determine a student's eligibility for financial aid. Students will be able to access the SAR for both the 2020–21 FAFSA cycle that began today, as well as the 2019–20 FAFSA cycle. As a result of customer feedback, FSA made changes to the signature process in myFAFSA to make it easier and clearer. The myStudentAid mobile app now also features helpful checklists to guide students and parents through the next steps in the student aid process. Additionally, students and parents can enable push notifications in the app to get important reminders and updates from the Department's office of Federal Student Aid. FAFSA users will benefit from the IRS Data Retrieval Tool (IRS DRT), which securely transfers students' and parents' financial information into the FAFSA form, which is now mobile-friendly and will fit the screen size and shape of any device, including desktop or laptop computers, smartphones, and tablets. As part of ongoing efforts to enhance privacy protection, when students, parents, or preparers log in to fafsa.gov by providing the student's Social Security number (SSN), the SSN will be masked, as it currently is on the myStudentAid mobile app. By the end of the year, the Department will launch the my FSApay account, a free option for students at participating schools to receive their credit balance refunds. Through this limited pilot, students: will have convenient self-service options; can add money other than student aid funds to the account (for example, money from a parent or peer-to-peer transfers); and will not be charged fees, including ATM fees. The account will be accessible via the my StudentAid mobile app's myMoney feature. Also, in the coming months, a new ""digital front door"" for students and parents will consolidate multiple customer-facing websites into one platform. The Department will introduce more personalized communications, as well as enhanced financial literacy tools and resources to help students and parents be more informed about their federal student loans."

The proposal, which the Secretary introduced in February of this year, is the Trump administration's groundbreaking solution for improving educational outcomes and ensuring an equal opportunity for all students across the country. The policy will make a historic investment in America's students, injecting up to $5 billion yearly into locally-controlled scholarship programs that empower students to choose the learning environment and style that best meets their unique needs. The proposal has gained significant support in both the House and Senate, where companion bills have been introduced by Representative Bradley Byrne (R-AL) and Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX). Following the Secretary’s remarks and panel discussion, a second panel convened with state education leaders from Tennessee, Arizona, and Pennsylvania. They discussed the ways in which they are rethinking education in their states to better serve students and the creative ways in which Education Freedom Scholarships could support those efforts.

To view the Secretary’s remarks at AEI and the subsequent panel discussions moderated by Rick Hess, resident scholar and director of education policy studies at AEI, click here . QUOTES TO NOTE “Our Education Freedom Scholarships proposal…doesn’t grow the government bureaucracy one tiny bit…It doesn’t impose any new requirements on states or on families. It doesn’t take a single dollar from public school students, and it doesn’t spend a single dollar of government money. And it doesn’t entangle schools with federal strings or stifling red tape. In fact, it can’t. And that’s by design.” *** “Education Freedom Scholarships are the conservative answer to what ails American education. They also happen to be the answer that a super-majority of parents, particularly African American and Hispanic parents, say they’re looking for.” *** “The key element of the proposal is freedom. Freedom for everyone involved. Students, families, teachers, schools, states… any and all can choose to participate in the program. Or they can elect not to participate. That’s what freedom is all about.” *** “Education freedom is pro-parent and pro-student. It is not anti-public school. If your school is working for your child, stay put…Education freedom isn’t about elevating one type of school over another—it’s about trusting parents and believing in students.” *** “Big union bullying is…unfair to the many students and parents who simply want better futures for their sons and daughters. I’ve been blessed to get to know many, many families who exercise education freedom…They couldn’t care less about how a school is legally structured or how the funds flow. They care about their kids.”"

The data shows that CTE participation, especially focusing one's studies by taking two or more CTE classes within the same career cluster, is positively correlated with both future employment and future earnings. While 77% of students take at least one CTE class while in high school, only 37% of participants focus their studies on a single career cluster. Eight years after their expected graduation dates, students who focused on CTE courses while in high school had higher median annual earnings than students who did not. The top three most prevalent career clusters in the nation's high schools were: (1) Arts, Audio-Visual Technology, and Communication; (2) Business Management and Administration; and (3) Health Science. The data story is a compact resource for learning more about CTE at the national and state levels. Highlights include: Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) in CTE are critical subjects for the U.S. economy, and STEM and STEM-related career clusters represent one-third of all CTE concentrations in high school (35 percent). The percentage of concentrations in STEM and STEM-related career clusters varies widely by state. About three-fourths of all public school districts offer dual credit in CTE, that is, any CTE course that can earn both high school and postsecondary credit (73 percent). The percentage of public school districts that offer dual credit CTE courses is higher among districts with larger enrollments and in cities. Descriptive data related to the education and labor market outcomes of CTE concentrators and non-CTE concentrators show more favorable outcomes for CTE concentrators. For example, the median annual earnings eight years after high school graduation are $23,950 for CTE concentrators compared to $20,015 for non-concentrators—a difference of nearly $4,000. ""CTE opens pathways to success for students whether they choose to pursue postsecondary education or enter the workforce after high school,"" said Scott Stump, Assistant Secretary for Career, Technical and Adult Education. ""These data show that students who concentrate in a high-demand CTE field, such as STEM or health sciences, go on to reap benefits from their studies long after graduation."""

These grants provide funding to create, implement, or take to scale an evidence-based innovation to improve academic achievement for high-need students, and for a rigorous evaluation so that others may learn from its results. ""For too long, the one-size-fits-all approach to education has failed too many students,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""Through the EIR program, grantees have the opportunity to rethink education and approach student learning in new ways. I'm excited to see states, school districts and nonprofits proposing more creativity, innovation and personalization on behalf of students."" In addition to promoting innovation generally, the awards include over $30 million to eight grantees serving rural areas and over $78 million to 29 grantees focused on Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) education. Over 85% of the funded STEM projects include a specific focus on computer science.

25-Sep-19,https://web.archive.org/web/20210108025343/https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/trump-administration-releases-school-safety-district-guide,Trump Administration Releases School Safety District Guide,"WASHINGTON — Today, as part of National Preparedness Month, which is recognized each September to promote emergency planning, the U.S. Department of Education, along with the U.S. Departments of Justice, Homeland Security, and Health and Human Services, released a new planning guide to help districts support schools developing and maintaining customized emergency operations plans (EOPs). The Role of Districts in Developing High-Quality School Emergency Operations Plans (District Guide) delivers on an interagency recommendation from the Federal Commission on School Safety's final report to provide resources to assist schools and school districts in developing customized school EOPs with their community partners, such as first responders. ""Each of us has an important role to play in keeping our nation's students, teachers and faculty safe at school,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. ""While there is no one-size-fits-all solution, the District Guide is a helpful resource for districts as they work with school planning teams creating Emergency Operations Plans that are unique to their school community. We want local leaders to have the resources and support they need to help prevent school violence and effectively respond and recover should tragedy occur."" Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey A. Rosen said, ""The safety of our nation's students is one of the highest priorities of this Administration and the Department of Justice. The District Guide is yet another tool for our local school districts to use to keep students, teachers and faculty safe. We will continue to work tirelessly with our federal, state and local law enforcement partners to make sure our nation's schools are protected."" Elinore F. McCance-Katz, Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use added, ""HHS is pleased to have played a significant role in the President's Federal Commission on School Safety. Federal departments are working together to ensure that comprehensive school-based systems centered on positive environments, safety and security of students, and recognition of mental health needs are in place across America's communities."" Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin K. McAleenan said, ""The release of the District Guide is an important step in our work with the nation's schools to help districts prevent, mitigate against, respond to, and recover from emergency situations. It's our intent that this new resource will assist districts in their efforts to strengthen their schools' resilience and emergency planning processes."" School EOPs are designed to proactively address a variety of hazards and threats and formalize the roles and responsibilities of those schools, school districts and community partners with responsibilities in school safety, before, during and after possible emergencies and address prevention, mitigation, protection, response and recovery. The District Guide serves as a complement to the Guide for Developing High-Quality School Emergency Operations Plans ( School Guide ) and provides information that can assist school districts in fulfilling both their individual and shared emergency planning responsibilities. Specifically, the District Guide complements the earlier School Guide by recommending specific roles and responsibilities for district-level administrators and staffs. Districts' responsibilities include the following: Coordinating with schools and community partners to make EOPs a collaborative effort and help ensure integration with district, local, or regional, state, tribal, and federal agency EOPs. Laying out planning parameters for use by schools throughout the entire district. Supporting schools at each step as they develop EOPs that address and plan for the wide variety of prioritized hazards and threats specific to their school community's needs. The District Guide also contains a checklist of activities and responsibilities for districts that allows them to stay on course and track their progress over time. Core planning teams within school districts can use this guide to inform the development of local policies and procedures related to school EOP development. In the coming weeks, the agencies will collaborate again to conduct a webinar providing an overview of the District Guide. Hosted by the Department of Education's Readiness and Emergency Management for Schools (REMS) Technical Assistance (TA) Center, the federal partners will present a one-hour webinar so participants can learn about the key aspects of the District Guide, its relationship to the School Guide , and key planning resources. Watch for future announcements about the webinar along with the following supplementary materials the REMS TA Center created to support the use and implementation of the District Guide recommendations by school districts and their community partners: District Guide Fact Sheet. Access this fact sheet to get background information on threats and hazards facing school districts and how they prepare for, respond to, and recover from associated emergencies. In addition, the fact sheet provides an overview of the District Guide format, including an outline of the district core planning team's role in school EOP development. District Guide Specialized Training Package. Use this self-paced training to review how to use the District Guide with core planning teams at your school district. It provides a walkthrough of the guide and offers recommended exercises that teams can use to enhance district emergency management planning. State and district leaders may use this to train their colleagues and planning teams."

The FY 2016 national CDR is the percentage of borrowers who entered repayment on Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program or William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan (Direct Loan) Program loans between Oct. 1, 2015 and Sept. 30, 2016 and subsequently defaulted prior to Sept. 30, 2018. During the FY 2016 borrower cohort tracking period, 4,533,276 borrowers entered repayment, and 458,687 of them—10.1%—defaulted on their loans. These borrowers attended 6,130 postsecondary institutions across the country. The FY 2016 CDR represents the lowest national CDR since the three-year rate was first published in 2012 for FY 2009. Rate Trends From FY 2015 to FY 2016, CDRs decreased for public, private, and proprietary institutions. For public institutions, the rate fell from 10.3% in FY 2015 to 9.6% in FY 2016, a 6.8% decrease from the FY 2015 rate. Public schools include 1,659 of the total number of postsecondary institutions, or approximately 27%. Public schools represent 2,467,803 of the total number of borrowers who entered repayment in FY 2016, or approximately 54%. For private institutions, the rate fell from 7.1% in FY 2015 to 6.6% in FY 2016, a 7.0% decrease from the FY 2015 rate. Private schools include 1,726 of the total number of postsecondary institutions, or approximately 28%. Private schools represent 1,069,593 of the total number of borrowers who entered repayment in FY 2016, or approximately 24%. For proprietary institutions, the rate fell from 15.6% in FY 2015 to 15.2% in FY 2016, a 2.6% decrease from the FY 2015 rate. Proprietary schools include 2,353 of the total number of institutions, or approximately 38%. Proprietary schools represent 985,335 of the total number of borrowers who entered repayment in FY 2016, or approximately 22%. Additionally, 392 foreign institutions, which make up approximately 6% of the total number of institutions, saw their CDR decrease by 3.2% from FY 2015 to FY 2016. The Department's default management website provides information about the national student loan default rate, as well as rates for individual schools, states, types of postsecondary institutions, and other details. Sanctions Schools with high default rates may lose their eligibility to participate in federal student aid programs. This year, 15 schools are subject to sanctions, including one public, one private, and 13 proprietary institutions. These schools include: DC – Washington – Bennett Career Institute ID – Burley – Cosmetology School of Arts and Sciences IL – Chicago – Larry's Barber College KY – Louisville – American College of Barbering MO – Kansas City – Transformed Barber & Cosmetology Academy ND – Bismarck – United Tribes Technical College NJ – Cherry Hill – Harris School of Business NY – Rochester – Sharp Edgez Barber Institute PA – Lancaster – Champ's Barber School SC – Denmark – Denmark Technical College TN – Memphis – Vibe Barber College TX – Farmers Branch – PCCenter TX – Grand Prairie – MT Training Center TX – Dickinson – K&G 5 Star Barber College WI – Beloit – First Class Cosmetology School Eleven of these 15 schools are subject to a loss of eligibility based on a CDR of 40% or more for one year, while seven are subject to a loss of eligibility based on a CDR of 30% or more for three years. Three schools are subject to a loss of eligibility based on a CDR of 40% or more for one year and a rate of 30% or greater for three years. In certain circumstances, schools may avoid sanctions by submitting successful appeals. Four of the 15 schools subject to sanctions in FY 2016 were subject to sanctions in FY 2015, including Champ's Barber School, Larry's Barber College, Sharp Edgez Barber Institute, and United Tribes Technical College. All institutions with a default rate that is equal to or greater than 30% must establish a default prevention task force that prepares a plan to identify the factors causing the school's CDR to exceed 30% and submit the plan to the Department. The Department's office of Federal Student Aid (FSA) provides extensive assistance to higher education institutions, including webinars and online training; state, regional, and national association training forums; and in-person training at the annual FSA Training Conference. Helping Borrowers Better Manage Student Loans The Department offers a variety of resources to help borrowers effectively manage their federal student loans. In addition to providing information about affordable repayment plans at StudentAid.gov/repay , the Department conducts outreach campaigns, uses social media to answer questions in real time, and provides loan counseling for borrowers to help them select repayment plans based on their specific circumstances. The Department will continue to emphasize practical planning that leads to better borrowing and repayment outcomes. Through an initiative known as Next Gen FSA, the Department also will provide even more support for borrowers to effectively manage their student loan debt. By the end of 2019, the Department will introduce enhanced financial literacy and informed-borrower tools, including a loan simulator that will allow borrowers to ""test drive"" personalized scenarios, set repayment goals, and develop informed financial strategies. ### Visit the FSA Data Center for information about the national student loan default rate, as well as rates for individual schools, states, types of postsecondary institutions, and other details.

The guide, Opportunities and Responsibilities for State and Local Report Cards, is aimed at assisting education leaders with the design and implementation of state and school district report cards as required by the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA). It follows the release of a special Parent Guide to State and Local Report Cards issued by the Department of Education in 2018. ""State and local report cards should be a rich source of information for parents to understand exactly how their child's school is performing, how much is being spent on their child, and how it compares to other schools in their community,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""But, if report cards are hard to understand or obfuscate, they will not serve their intended purpose which is to empower families with relevant, accurate and actionable data. The information released today is meant to help state and local leaders make sure the report cards they are developing, as required by law, achieve ESSA's intended goal."" During development of the document, the Department held listening sessions with parents and other stakeholders to gather feedback about effective and accessible ways to represent data on state and local report cards. These insights guided the development of Opportunities and Responsibilities for State and Local Report Cards. Stakeholders emphasized the need to provide transparency about how well a child's school is performing and ensure that report cards provide information in a manner that parents and the general public can understand and use. The Department also published a draft version of the document for a 30-day public comment period earlier this year. This document clarifies the requirements for states and districts regarding the reporting requirements in section 1111(h) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), as amended by ESSA, and provides information states and districts may consider in developing and disseminating report cards.

The Department produced a question and answer (Q&A) guide after the Secretary heard from the field there was confusion about whether and when these funds could be used to help students and youth with disabilities access these valuable educational options. ""All students deserve the freedom to pursue an education that is challenging and allows them to reach their full potential,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""I hope this information will make clear what the law says and serve as a resource to families, Individualized Education Program (IEP) Teams and State VR agencies as they continue to collaborate and find ways to increase postsecondary opportunities – and success – for students and youth with disabilities."" Issued jointly by the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS) and the Office of Postsecondary Education (OPE), the Q&A document describes how State educational agencies, local educational agencies, and State VR agencies may coordinate to assist students and youth with disabilities, including students and youth with intellectual disabilities, in preparing for postsecondary success. The document reinforces the appropriate use of funds under the IDEA and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended by Title IV of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. The Q&A will be released today by Johnny Collett, Assistant Secretary for OSERS, at an Education Freedom Tour stop at the University of Missouri – Kansas City (UMKC) . While at UMKC, Assistant Secretary Collett will visit the Propel Program, a transition program for young adults with intellectual developmental disabilities that allows students an opportunity to explore employment and education on a major university campus. ""The Department is committed to ensuring that students and youth with disabilities are held to high expectations and have the resources and supports needed to expand their learning opportunities and prepare them for success in postsecondary education or careers,"" said Collett. Specifically, the Q&A addresses the following topics: The opportunity for students with disabilities to enroll in postsecondary education programs while still in high school; The opportunity for students and youth with disabilities to enroll in comprehensive transition and other postsecondary programs for individuals with disabilities after leaving high school; The coordination of transition-related services that students with disabilities may receive under the IDEA and under the VR program; and The financial aid available to students with disabilities enrolled in comprehensive transition and postsecondary education programs for students with intellectual disabilities offered at Institutions of Higher Education under the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended.

DeVos Calls for a ""New Birth of Freedom"" in Milwaukee, the Birthplace of Education Freedom, to Kick Off 2019 Back to School Tour","MILWAUKEE — Today, U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos began her 2019 Back-to-School Tour in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the birthplace of modern education freedom. In a speech at St. Marcus Lutheran School, Sec. DeVos noted the incredible progress the education freedom movement has made since visionary leaders like Annette ""Polly"" Williams and Howard Fuller ignited the parental choice movement 30 years ago but acknowledged there is still much work left to be done. Secretary DeVos urged leaders across the country to embrace the Administration's education freedom agenda so that every student in America can have unlimited access to the education that best helps them reach their fullest potential. Secretary DeVos said, ""Now is the time to ignite a new birth of freedom for all of America's students. We have a bold plan to do just that—an American education freedom agenda. The freedom to learn. The freedom to grow. The freedom to advance. The freedom to pursue the education that works for you. Students in control of their pathway to a successful education, career, and life. Families in control of how, when, and where their students will learn best. Teachers in control of their classrooms and their careers. States and communities—not Washington, D.C.—in control of local decisions."" QUOTES TO NOTE: ""Students: We're here because of you—and for you. In fact, everything about education should be focused solely on you. After all, as a nation, we've committed to help each student prepare for the future. Some people confuse that as a commitment to a building, to a system, or to a particular way of learning. But your education must be about who you are and all that you see for yourself, for your family, for your community, and importantly for our country."" *** ""There are still too many [students] who don't know how to read. There are still too many who don't know how to add, subtract, divide, or multiply. And too many have no power to do anything about it. That's because the education cabal puts other issues above what's right for students. Mixed-up priorities are borne out in the numbers. Consider that American taxpayers spend—on average— about $13,000 per student, per year. With an average class size of 21 students, that adds up to $273,000 per classroom, per year. We know the average classroom teacher makes about $60,000 annually. So, where does the rest of the money go? More than $200,000 per classroom and teachers are still buying school supplies out of their pockets. ""Well, here's the dirty little secret: it's to highly paid administrators, coordinators, consultants, assistant principals, assistant superintendents… layers and layers of bureaucracy. The growth in non-instructional school staff has increased nine times faster than student enrollment growth."" *** ""We know American families want more control and more options when it comes to education. That's why every poll shows growing, bipartisan support for education freedom. And for every approach to education freedom—public charter schools, vouchers, education savings accounts, tax credit scholarships—support crosses ethnic and political lines. Education freedom policies work. We just need more of them. Many more."" *** ""Think of Education Freedom Scholarships as keys to unlocking the opportunities you want to pursue. This isn't about picking a school building. That's thinking too small. Instead, think about unleashing thousands of not yet imagined ways for students of all ages to learn."" SECRETARY DEVOS' REMARKS AS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY: Thanks, everyone, for letting me join you today. It's hard to see summer end. But ""back to school"" season is an exciting time of year. I think it's useful, as we begin any new season, to reflect on where we've been, where we are, and importantly, where we want to go. Students, we're here because of you—and for you. In fact, everything about education should be focused solely on you. After all, as a nation, we've committed to help each student prepare for the future. Some people confuse that as a commitment to a building, to a system, or to a particular way of learning. But your education must be about who you are and all that you see for yourself, for your family, for your community, and importantly for our country. That's what I like about St. Marcus. This school community is built around giving students what they need. Something important is happening here. You're doing things differently, and as a result, students who learn here far and away outperform their peers. I think that has to do with how you are so intentional about cultivating the relationship between student, parent, and teacher. You call it a covenant—indeed, a sacred promise—to do everything in your power ""to ensure academic success."" Your students, your families, and your great teachers choose to commit to this covenant. You each acknowledge everyone has a role to play, and that you all depend on one another. This should be commonly understood. Obvious. Normal. But we know it all too often isn't, and it wasn't always this way in Milwaukee. Parents, teachers: you remember the problems you and your students faced years ago. Fewer than 60 percent of students finished high school. Students' confidence crushed, teachers frustrated, and parents heartbroken. Everyone wanted something different. Something better. Then, along came ""Polly."" You all know the ""mother"" of our movement, Annette ""Polly"" Williams. She wanted better for her own children, and for children in her own community. She couldn't bear to see her city's students struggling, so she did something about it. Polly worked with anyone and everyone to help students—and pushed back against anyone who didn't. She and civil rights icon Howard Fuller fought their own political party, the NAACP, and the unions. And they won when Governor Tommy Thompson, who was from a different political party, established the Milwaukee Parental Choice program. They all put politics aside and did what was right for kids. They believed that students matter. It didn't matter who their parents were, nor where they lived, nor what color they were, or who they knew, or how much they had in their pockets. All that mattered was that students were students. Polly's will to win 30 years ago was the first of many victories for students and families. At first, the program was small, able to empower only a few of Milwaukee's parents. But as demand expanded, so did the program. Today, the Parental Choice program and others like it serve about 37,000 students statewide, including almost every student here at St. Marcus. You wouldn't be here—and I wouldn't be here—if not for the courage of Polly, Howard, and the parents who joined them in the fight. So, I've come to Milwaukee—the birthplace of education freedom—to stand on the shoulders of giants and say: Now is the time to ignite a new birth of freedom for all of America's students. We have a bold plan to do just that—an American education freedom agenda. The freedom to learn. The freedom to grow. The freedom to advance. The freedom to pursue the education that works for you. Students in control of their pathway to a successful education, career, and life. Families in control of how, when, and where their students will learn best. Teachers in control of their classrooms and their careers. States and communities—not Washington, D.C.—in control of local decisions. Why is this freedom so desperately needed today? Because what we're doing—what we've been doing—isn't working. Open up our Nation's Report Card and you'll see what I mean. Two in three of our Nation's 8th graders aren't learning what they need to be prepared for their futures. And consider this: The United States ranks 24th in reading, 25th in science, and 40th in math in the world. Think about it. These statistics have very real consequences for our future. For one, students can't pass military entrance exams. Nearly one in four Americans who want to serve are turned away because they fail the Army's basic test. I also think of my recent visit to an Indiana prison. The warden told me that the biggest problem there is not violence or discipline. It's illiteracy. Then there's the story of a father whose son, a recent high school graduate, was honored in the local newspaper. Dad's pride turned to disappointment after he discovered his son couldn't read or comprehend the article. So, dad marched over to the high school principal's office with his son and newspaper in tow and asked his son to read the article to the principal. He couldn't. Then the father pointedly asked the principal how he could've graduated his son—or anyone—who can't read. There are still too many who don't know how to read. There are still too many who don't know how to add, subtract, divide, or multiply. And too many have no power to do anything about it. That's because the education cabal puts other issues above what's right for students. Mixed-up priorities are borne out in the numbers. Consider that American taxpayers spend—on average— about $13,000 per student, per year. With an average class size of 21 students, that adds up to $273,000 per classroom, per year. We know the average classroom teacher makes about $60,000 annually. So, where does the rest of the money go? More than $200,000 per classroom and teachers are still buying school supplies out of their pockets. Well, here's the dirty little secret: it's to highly paid administrators, coordinators, consultants, assistant principals, assistant superintendents—layers and layers of bureaucracy. The growth in non-instructional school staff has increased nine times faster than student enrollment growth. It just doesn't add up. And though Federal taxpayer spending is less than 9 percent of total education spending, over the past 40 years taxpayers have spent well-over one trillion dollars at the Federal level alone trying to improve student outcomes. And the research shows almost no progress in closing the achievement gap. Yet, there are many in Washington still arguing to spend more—way more—doing more of the same things. Our sole focus should be on how to do better—starting today. Doing better begins by expanding freedom. Let me paint a picture of what that might mean. Students, education freedom for you could look like this: If you need more time to learn a concept or lesson, you get it. If you need less time, you can move on. If you want to study a language or a subject that your school building doesn't offer, you can learn it somewhere else. If you don't like to study behind a desk and learn better in a lab or in a garden or between skyscrapers, you can do that. If you want hands-on experiences to help decide your learning pathway, you can have those. You should be free to learn in any way and in any place that works for you. Teachers, education freedom for you could look like this: If you want to try something new in your classroom that you think will better help your students, you can. If you want to mentor other teachers, you can do that, and you should be rewarded for it. If you want to control your professional development and career path, you'd have the power to do so. You should be free to teach in any way and in any place that works for you and your students—and you should be properly paid for your success. Parents, education freedom for you could look like this: If the government-assigned school isn't working for your child, you can take him or her anywhere else. And if your school is working for your child, you can stay put. Another parent's freedom to make a choice doesn't mean you have to make the same choice. If you want to homeschool your children for part of the week and send them to a classical academy the rest of the week, you can do that. If one type of learning or instruction is best for your son and another is better for your daughter, you have the flexibility to make those choices. If a school closer to your work is a better fit for your family, that's your choice. You should be free to make the decisions that work best for your children and your family. We know American families want more control and more options when it comes to education. That's why every poll shows growing, bipartisan support for education freedom. And for every approach to education freedom—public charter schools, vouchers, education savings accounts, tax credit scholarships—support crosses ethnic and political lines. Education freedom policies work. We just need more of them. Many more. That's why this Administration has put forward the most transformative idea for American education in decades: Education Freedom Scholarships. I hope you've seen our proposal. I don't want to dive into the details here; you can visit our website for those. What I do want to talk about is what Education Freedom Scholarships will mean. For the student who wants to gain valuable career skills by apprenticing, she can use an Education Freedom Scholarship to learn her craft while learning her core subjects. For the student who is bullied at his government-assigned school, he can use an Education Freedom Scholarship to learn elsewhere. To the student who wants to get a head start on college credit while completing her high school studies, she can use an Education Freedom Scholarship to do just that. For the single mom who works three jobs just to make ends meet while her kid is trapped in a school that's chronically failing him, she can use an Education Freedom Scholarship to give her son opportunities for a better life. Think of Education Freedom Scholarships as keys to unlocking the opportunities you want to pursue. This isn't about picking a school building. That's thinking too small. Instead, think about unleashing thousands of not yet imagined ways for students of all ages to learn. On last year's Back to School tour, I saw some great examples. This year, we'll head across the Midwest to see more innovations and options that are meeting kids' needs. Students, you are our future. Nothing should limit your success, and nothing should be off-limits if it helps you learn and grow. I loved learning about Terrance, a St. Marcus grad. His father died when he was young, but his mother Deanna was not about to let that derail TJ's bright future. He did well in school but wasn't being challenged and learning behind a desk all day didn't work for him. So, his mom used the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program to enroll TJ here at St. Marcus. And, for the first time, someone at school asked him what he was passionate about learning. TJ is a food artist. He wanted to know more about making his interest a profession. So, St. Marcus focused his studies around the culinary arts. He even prepared a few meals for his classmates using food grown right here at St. Marcus. And he's interning at a renowned local restaurant where he continues to develop his culinary skills. His mom believes that because of Milwaukee's voucher program, because of St. Marcus, because he was free to learn in ways that worked for him, TJ found his purpose. All of America's mothers and fathers want that for their sons and daughters. All of America's families want more options, more choices, more freedom. Everyone—no matter their age—needs the freedom to learn, to grow, to pursue their passions, to use their talents, and to achieve their fullest potential. In every student I meet across the country I am filled with great hope. Ahead there is daylight. Here's a glimpse into the future: American education is bustling. It's dynamic. It's innovative. Adaptive. Personalized. Relevant. And our students are number one in the world. So, let's recommit ourselves to the cause of education freedom—right here where it all began. Standing shoulder to shoulder with the first freedom students, let's resolve together—form our own covenant—to finish the work that was started here more than 30 years ago. Thank you all. May God bless America and our Nation's future, her students."
12-Sep-19,https://web.archive.org/web/20210108025343/https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-educations-office-civil-rights-requires-significant-corrective-action-chicago-public-schools-following-systemic-failure-address-sexual-violence,U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights Requires Significant Corrective Action from Chicago Public Schools Following Systemic Failure to Address Sexual Violence,"WASHINGTON — Today, the U.S. Department of Education announced that it has reached a resolution agreement with Chicago Public Schools (CPS) that will require significant structural and procedural changes within the District in order to protect students from sexual assault and abuse. The Office for Civil Rights (OCR) concluded that , for years, CPS's management, handling, and oversight of complaints of student-on-student and adult-on-student sexual harassment has violated Title IX. In May 2015 and November 2016, OCR received two individual complaints alleging that the District failed to respond to sexual harassment and sexual assault of students by both teachers and other students. OCR not only opened investigations into both incidents, but also initiated a systemic, district-wide investigation concerning whether the District failed to respond to complaints of sexual harassment, including sexual assault. OCR's investigation found that the District's Title IX investigations were inadequate, unreliable, and often conducted by untrained staff. In addition, there was no coordination of the District's Title IX responsibilities. Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Kenneth L. Marcus said, ""The Chicago Public Schools have inexcusably failed, for quite some time, to provide their students with the basic protections required by law. I am glad that CPS has now agreed to make a number of serious, substantive changes to come into compliance with Title IX. These issues must be addressed to ensure that all students in Chicago Public Schools have an opportunity to learn in a safe educational environment free from the threat of sexual harassment or sexual assault."" OCR found that CPS failed to respond promptly and equitably to complaints, did not provide services and remedies to the complainants, did not notify the complainants of investigation outcomes, and did not take effective action to provide a safe environment for all students. In many instances, the District did not respond adequately to complaints that District-affiliated adults engaged in sexual harassment, assault or grooming of students. Furthermore, CPS did not have a Title IX coordinator from 1999 to December 2018, and its poor recordkeeping made it impossible to coordinate its Title IX responsibilities. Based on the deficiencies in CPS's Title IX procedures and in the District's handling of complaints of sexual misconduct, OCR is requiring the District to take the following actions: Provide complainants who believe the District mishandled their complaints of sexual misconduct with the opportunity to receive a second, independent review of those complaints Review the actions of current and former District employees who failed to take appropriate responsive action to reports of sexual misconduct, and as appropriate, take responsive action concerning those employees Revise its Title IX structure to ensure that the Title IX Coordinator has full authority to effectively coordinate the District's efforts to comply with Title IX Develop a comprehensive process for responding to all complaints of sex discrimination and fully document responsive actions taken; and Change the District's Title IX procedures to ensure impartial investigation of sexual misconduct complaints, including a requirement that attorneys involved in a Title IX investigation recuse themselves from handling the same case against the District. Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs and activities that receive federal funds. Under Title IX, school districts like CPS have an obligation to respond promptly and equitably to allegations of sex-based harassment, including reports of sexual violence, and remedy the effects of such harassment."

The fine and required corrective action come after two separate investigations, one by the office of Federal Student Aid (FSA) and the other by the Office for Civil Rights (OCR), as directed by U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. ""What transpired at Michigan State was abhorrent, inexcusable, and a total and complete failure to follow the law and protect students,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""Michigan State will now pay for its failures and will be required to make meaningful changes to how it handles Title IX cases moving forward. No future student should have to endure what too many did because concerns about Larry Nassar and William Strampel were ignored. ""I want to thank each of the survivors who came forward and shared their stories. Doing so took an incredible amount of courage. Never again should incidents of sexual misconduct on campuses—or anywhere—be swept under the rug. Students, faculty and staff must all feel empowered to come forward, know that they will be taken seriously, and know that the Department of Education will hold schools accountable. ""I also want to thank our FSA and OCR investigators who have worked tirelessly to bring justice for students. They followed the facts and ensured today's resolution would drive meaningful change."" In February 2018, Secretary DeVos directed the Office for Civil Rights to launch a systemic investigation into MSU's handling of reports of sexual violence against former employee and adjunct professor, Dr. Larry Nassar. Concurrently, FSA continued its investigation into the University's compliance with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act (Clery Act). The Department will require MSU to pay $4.5 million in fines based on four serious findings of Clery Act noncompliance: Finding #1: Failure to Properly Classify Reported Incidents and Disclose Crime Statistics Finding #2: Failure to Issue Timely Warnings in Accordance with Federal Regulations Finding #3: Failure to Identify and Notify Campus Security Authorities and to Establish an Adequate System for Collecting Crimes Statistics from all Required Sources Finding #4: Lack of Administrative Capability As a result of these findings, MSU must take corrective actions that include the following: Employ an independent Clery Compliance Officer, who will report to a high-level executive; Establish a new Clery Compliance Committee that includes representation from more than 20 offices that play a role in campus safety, crime prevention, fire safety, emergency management, and substance abuse prevention; and Create a system of protective measures and expanded reporting to better ensure the safety of its student-athletes in both intercollegiate and recreational athletic programs. Similar steps will be taken to better ensure the safety of minor children who participate in camps or other youth programs that are sponsored by the University or that are held on its properties. ""Students are our focus, and we are committed to their safety on campus,"" said FSA Chief Operating Officer Mark Brown. ""Our findings and the required corrective actions should serve as a reminder to all schools that we take seriously our commitment to vigorously enforce the Clery Act and protect all students. Any school that falls short will be held accountable."" OCR conducted a separate Title IX directed investigation into MSU's handling of reports of sexual violence against Nassar. During its directed investigation, OCR reviewed hundreds of sexual assault reports, interviewed 47 witnesses including survivors, and reviewed tens of thousands of documents. OCR's investigation revealed that MSU failed to adequately respond to reports of sexual misconduct by Nassar and William Strampel (the former dean of MSU's College of Osteopathic Medicine and Nassar's supervisor), failed to take appropriate interim measures to protect its students while complaints against Nassar and Strampel were pending, and failed to take prompt and effective steps to end any harassment, eliminate the hostile environment, and prevent any further harassment from recurring. As a result of the investigation, MSU signed a resolution agreement to address the Title IX violations, which, among several provisions, requires that the University do the following: Make substantial changes to the University's Title IX procedures and ensure that certain officials recuse themselves from Title IX matters; Take remedial actions to address the impact of the sexual misconduct by Nassar and Strampel on students, faculty and other staff within the College, the Sports Medicine Clinic, and related facilities, programs and services; Provide a process for those victims of Dr. Nassar, who have not otherwise had an opportunity to seek remedy, to come forward and seek remedies to which they might be entitled; Review the actions of current and former employees of the University who had notice but who failed to take appropriate action in response to reports of sexual misconduct by Nassar or Strampel and consider appropriate sanctions against those employees; Address the campus climate around issues of sexual harassment and sexual violence, strengthen staff training, and assess the need for additional student services; and Exercise adequate Title IX oversight of the University's youth programs by notifying Youth Program participants of its Title IX grievance procedure and that the procedures apply to Youth Programs. ""This resolution should demonstrate, beyond any doubt, this administration's commitment to the vigorous enforcement of civil rights,"" said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Kenneth L. Marcus. ""There should be no question that we will hold colleges and universities accountable if they perpetuate sexual violence by failing to meet their obligations under Title IX.""

Under Title IX, universities such as MSU have an obligation to take immediate and appropriate steps to investigate allegations of sex-based harassment, including reports of sexual violence. If an investigation reveals that the harassment creates a hostile environment, the educational institutions must take prompt and effective steps to end the harassment, eliminate the hostile environment, prevent its recurrence and, as appropriate, remedy its effects. Enacted in 1990, the Clery Act requires higher education institutions to collect data on sexual assault crimes, hate crimes, Violence Against Women Act offenses, and other criminal offenses committed on their campus and in certain adjacent areas, and to report that data to employees and students annually. The Clery Act also requires schools to notify students of existing threats to campus safety and to train personnel to accurately report crimes."

The Institutional Accountability regulations, posted on the Department's website today, come after more than two years of deliberations, public hearings, negotiated rulemaking with a wide variety of higher education stakeholders and careful consideration of tens of thousands of public comments. ""If a school defrauds students, it must be held accountable,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. ""There is no place for fraud in higher education, and it will not be tolerated by this Administration. From the recent college admissions scandal and intentional misrepresentations by schools to boost their U.S. News & World Report rankings to fraudulent marketing practices from proprietary intuitions, too many institutions of higher education are falling short. The new regulations are aimed at preventing this behavior because students deserve better, and all institutions must do better. ""I called for this regulatory reset more than two years ago, as it became clear the old rules just weren't working. I want to thank all those who provided thoughtful feedback during the process. We made substantive changes to our proposed rule based on your input. We believe this final rule corrects the wrongs of the 2016 rule through common sense and carefully crafted reforms that hold colleges and universities accountable and treat students and taxpayers fairly."" The final Institutional Accountability regulations, which would apply to all federal student loans made on or after July 1, 2020, would: Grant borrowers the right to assert borrower defense to repayment claims against institutions, regardless of whether the loan is in default or in collection proceedings. Maintain the current rule's preponderance of the evidence standard for all borrower defense to repayment claims. Allow borrowers ample opportunity to file defense to repayment claims – three years from either the student's date of graduation or withdrawal from the institution. Create streamlined and fair procedures, regardless of the borrower's current repayment status, that ensure basic due process for all parties. Give students the ability to allege a specific amount of financial harm and to obtain relief in an amount determined by the Department, which may be greater or lesser than their original claim amount. Extend the closed school discharge window from 120 days to 180 days, ensuring that students have a meaningful opportunity to obtain relief if they cannot complete their programs due to school closures. Reduce precipitous closures by encouraging institutions to close only after the completion of well-planned teach-outs that allow students a reasonable opportunity to finish their programs. Allow students to choose between accepting an institution's offer of a teach-out opportunity or submitting a closed school discharge to the Department. Provide fair, clear and verifiable financial triggers for recalculating an institution's financial responsibility composite score and triggering additional security to protect taxpayers. Update composite score calculations to reflect changes to Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) accounting standards. Provide taxpayers with a net federal budget savings over the 2020-2029 loan cohorts of $11.1 billion, including $9.8 billion for changes to the defense to repayment provisions and $1.3 billion for changes related to closed school discharges. The regulations will take effect July 1, 2020; however, the regulations relating to financial responsibility will be available for immediate implementation.

23-Aug-19,https://web.archive.org/web/20210108025343/https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-continues-work-improve-civil-rights-data-quality,U.S. Department of Education Continues Work to Improve Civil Rights Data Quality,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos announced today that the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights (OCR) and the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) will work collaboratively to improve the information collected in the Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC). The partnership between OCR and NCES will help to ensure that the CRDC data is valid, reliable and authenticated in a manner that provides a more accurate picture of key civil rights issues in education. ""OCR has worked to continuously improve CRDC data quality—and has taken unprecedented steps to ensure school districts report accurate data to the Department,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. ""This agreement between OCR and NCES is one additional step to make sure that we are doing everything we can to help states and school districts provide correct CRDC data that can be relied on by the public, parents and families."" Under the new agreement, NCES and OCR will work together to support school districts by providing technical assistance resources, training and prompt feedback on identified issues. Through this partnership, OCR and NCES will also work together to review and revise data quality procedures when needed to reflect lessons learned during collection and review of CRDC data. ""NCES is able to bring its appropriate expertise in data quality assessment, data collection and the preparation of data collected under the CRDC,"" said Kenneth L. Marcus, assistant secretary for civil rights. ""While OCR will continue to oversee the CRDC, the specialized experience NCES will contribute to this process is invaluable—and will only result on the more accurate collection and reporting of civil rights data in schools. I'm looking forward to this partnership with NCES."" Mark Schneider, director of the Institute of Education Sciences (IES), which oversees NCES, said, ""NCES is responsible for providing scientific evidence that is critical to education practice and policy. By providing valid and reliable data through surveys, research and evaluations, the quality of education data about American schools will continue to improve. I look forward to this exciting partnership with the Office for Civil Rights to raise the caliber of work that is done through the CRDC."" This agreement with NCES is yet another step toward improving the collection and reporting of CRDC data. Over the past year, OCR has increased funding to its technical assistance center, which provides support to school districts and works to ensure that they have the information they need to accurately report CRDC data. Additionally, OCR has been working with districts to ensure that the improvement action plans submitted by school districts specifically address data quality. These efforts are already yielding results. With the recent close of the 2017-2018 collection, a record 99.81% of school districts reported their CRDC data to OCR. That success is sure to continue as OCR embarks on its partnership with NCES. OCR relies on the collection and dissemination of data—on key educational and civil rights issues—to carry out its mission of ensuring equal access to education for all students. The CRDC provides data to the public, researchers and policy makers, and informs OCR's work through the initiation of proactive compliance reviews, monitoring under corrective action plans and the investigation of complaints.

Trump signed a Presidential Memorandum that will significantly streamline the process to erase federal student loan debt for totally and permanently disabled veterans. Through a process called Total and Permanent Disability (TPD) Discharge, veterans will now have their student loan debt discharged unless they decide to opt-out of the process. The Department anticipates notifying more than 25,000 eligible veterans and continuing the discharge process on a quarterly basis. The memorandum issued today builds on improvements to the TPD discharge process implemented by U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos and U.S. Secretary of Veterans Affairs Robert Wilkie. In April 2018 , the Department established a data matching process with the VA to identify totally and permanently disabled veterans who are eligible for student loan relief. Since April 2018, this process has resulted in Secretary DeVos providing more than $650 million in student loan relief to more than 22,000 eligible veterans. ""Supporting and caring for those who have sacrificed much in service to our country is a priority for President Trump and the entire Administration,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""I appreciate the President's strong leadership on this issue and his willingness to provide much-needed student loan relief. We will continue to prioritize the needs of our nation's veterans and provide them the help and support they have earned and deserve."" Veterans will still have the right to weigh their options and to decline loan discharge within 60 days of notification of their eligibility. Veterans may elect to decline loan relief either because of potential tax liability in some states, or because receiving loan relief could make it more difficult to take future student loans. Eligible veterans who do not opt out of the program will have their remaining student loan balance discharged and will be reimbursed for payments made following the date of their disability discharge."

""American families want more control and more options when it comes to education, which is why every poll conducted shows the growing, bipartisan support for education freedom. This research is just the latest indication that voices of America’s parents are growing louder in demanding something other than a government-assigned, union-controlled school for their children. Behind each percentage point in the column for education freedom is the face of another forgotten voter who has been taken for granted for far too long. I hear it from students who want to learn more and learn differently, but are constrained by their assigned school building. I’ve heard it from parents across this country who worry that this generation won’t be prepared for the modern economy. And I hear it from teachers who are denied by the one-size-fits-all system the freedom and flexibility to teach in the ways they know will be most effective. ""Clearly, our Education Freedom Scholarships proposal is the solution American families want. This common-sense approach puts students and parents in control, without taking a single cent from public schools or teachers. It’s time opponents of education freedom tamped down their overheated political rhetoric and instead focused on improving student outcomes. They should take note that this poll shows students rank the quality of their own schools lower than anyone else does. ""Education freedom is on the march across this nation. Congress would be wise to heed the call of America’s families."""

The NEA recently sued the department over its delay in implementing Obama-era rules that govern state standards for online education. The rules require, among other things, that all institutions providing distance education to students in another state document that the state has a process for those students to complain against that institution. Unfortunately, not all states have the required complaint processes or interstate agreements in place. As a result, the 2016 regulation would deny federal aid to a number of students receiving distance education because their institutions cannot meet the complaint process requirement in one or more states. In delaying the rule, the Department had clearly articulated that states were not well positioned to implement it and that there would be severe consequences to students as a result. That led, among other things, to the Department achieving a historic consensus in negotiated rulemaking on an amended state authorization rule that would address this and other problems in the 2016 rule. The NEA ignored that bipartisan agreement and instead pursued its litigation, resulting in today’s unfortunate circumstances. “This is just one of many consequences of the previous administration’s flawed state authorization rule that we worked to help students avoid. But the NEA has chosen to try and score political points rather than put students first,” said Secretary DeVos. “I urge the NEA to do the right thing and stop blocking the Department’s efforts to delay the 2016 State Authorization Distance Education regulation so that students enrolled in distance education programs at nonprofit and public institutions may continue their education. Groups like the American Council on Education and Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education have warned that the poorly written regulation would give rise to 'unintended consequences with the possibility of significant harm to students.’ That day has come. It’s time for the NEA and its allies to drop the pointless politics, get out of the way and let the Department fix these regulations so students can focus on their education.”"

""The GAO report released today further proves what I've long said: there is significant risk in the federal student loan portfolio. For years there have been deliberate efforts to make the maze of student aid more complex for students and less accountable to the American taxpayers who underwrite it. Today's report is just the latest proof that many of the policy ideas previously pursued were poorly implemented. ""Misrepresenting income or family size is wrong, and we must have a system in place to ensure that dishonest people do not get away with it. We didn't create that problem, but rest assured we will fix it. ""As the GAO highlights, the lack of accountability built into these programs creates significant risk for taxpayers. That's why the Department has already looked at ways to better verify income and family size for all borrowers enrolled in income-driven repayment programs. However, without Congressional action, we are unable to partner with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to independently verify this information. I am again calling on Congress to provide the Department the authority to independently verify income using IRS data. ""If Congress provides the Department with this authority, we could significantly reduce the risk of fraud and improper payments, save taxpayers money, and reduce the burden on borrowers when they annually recertify their income with the Department. ""While access to this IRS data is vital, until Congress passes legislation, we will work to be responsive to the GAO recommendations. The Department is also working to identify and refer cases of suspected fraud to the Department of Justice for prosecution."""

Georgia and North Carolina will take part in the innovative assessments pilot program, part of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), during the 2019-2020 school year. ""I'm pleased that Georgia and North Carolina are rethinking how to assess student achievement in ways that are more relevant and connected to the classroom,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. ""This pilot program gives states that are willing to try a new approach an opportunity to assess student achievement without sacrificing rigor or skirting accountability. I look forward to seeing the impact this study will have on student outcomes."" The Innovative Assessment Demonstration Authority (IADA) program is designed to encourage local involvement in the development of the next generation of assessments. As part of the program, states can pilot new and innovative assessments on a small scale, avoid double-testing students on both pilot and statewide exams, and develop strategies for implementing such innovative assessments statewide over time. Georgia will pilot two different innovative assessments: one based on the use of adaptive interim assessments, and the other based on the use of on-demand assessments designed to provide real-time data on student performance. Both assessments utilize technology to provide educators with valuable data that can be used to target support during the school year. North Carolina's new innovative assessment will rely on the use of a customized, end-of-year assessment (called a ""route"") for each student, developed in response to a student's performance on two formative assessments taken during the school year. Each route represents a cluster of test questions designed to measure a student's achievement accurately and efficiently. To participate in the pilot, states must apply and demonstrate how their innovative assessments are developed in collaboration with local stakeholders, aligned to challenging state academic standards and accessible to all students through use of principles of universal design for learning, among other requirements. Georgia and North Carolina join two other pilot states, Louisiana and New Hampshire, which were granted flexibility as part of the IADA in 2018."

In fact, OCR has, on average, resolved almost double the number of civil rights complaints per year compared to the prior eight fiscal years. Additionally, OCR has achieved a 60% increase in the number of complaint resolutions that required schools to make changes to protect students’ civil rights. “From day one, our approach has been clear and unwavering: vigorously enforce civil rights laws, treat students as individuals, and resolve cases both efficiently and effectively,” said Secretary DeVos. “The backlog of cases we inherited should have troubled everyone, as we know justice delayed is justice denied. While many have tried to distort the nature of our approach, the numbers don’t lie. Our approach has been more effective at supporting students and delivering meaningful results.” By the numbers: In FY 2017 and 2018, OCR resolved, on average, 16,000 complaints per year compared to an average of 8,200 complaint resolutions per year under the previous administration In the last two years, OCR has seen a 60% increase over the previous eight years in the annual number of complaint resolutions requiring a school to make a substantive change to protect students’ civil rights, including: A 30% increase in Title VI (race/national origin) resolutions requiring corrective action from a school A 60% increase in the number of disability-related resolutions requiring corrective action An 80% increase in Title IX (sex discrimination) case resolutions requiring corrective action In 2018 alone, OCR resolved nearly as many sexual violence complaints that required corrective action to protect students’ civil rights as the prior administration resolved in all eight years combined In FY 2017 and 2018, OCR resolved 31 complaints annually per full-time staff compared to only 14.5 complaints annually per full-time staff during the previous eight years In FY 2017 and 2018, OCR resolved, on average, 3,297 more complaints annually than it received. In the eight fiscal years prior, OCR resolved, on average, 1,262 fewer complaints than it received, which resulted in the current administration inheriting more than 7,800 unresolved cases “We are reorienting OCR to a neutral, impartial law enforcement agency and that is having tremendous, positive impacts on America’s students and their families,” said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Kenneth L. Marcus. “Instead of seeing every case as an opportunity to advance a political agenda, we are focused on the needs of each individual student and on faithfully executing the laws. This is the right thing to do, and the data show it works.” The mission of OCR is to ensure equal access to education and to promote educational excellence throughout the nation through the vigorous enforcement of civil rights. OCR primarily carries out its enforcement responsibilities by investigating and resolving individual complaints filed with the Department of Education. A complaint of discrimination can be filed by anyone who believes that an education institution that receives federal financial assistance has discriminated against someone on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, disability, or age. The person or organization filing the complaint need not be a victim of the alleged discrimination but may complain on behalf of another person or group.

The Trump administration championed the passage of this new law which is designed to improve career and technical education (CTE) and help students gain the skills they need to compete for in-demand, high-wage jobs in their communities. As of today, the Department has received, reviewed, and approved every state’s Perkins V one-year transition plan. ""Our team is so encouraged by the way states have embraced the spirit of this new law and are rethinking career and technical education on behalf of their students,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. ""The work is just beginning though. As states begin to think about their long-term career and technical education strategies, I would encourage them to continue to act boldly and break down the silos that exist between education and industry so that all students are prepared for the in-demand, high-paying jobs of today's economy and tomorrow's."" Perkins V will provide nearly $1.3 billion to states, school districts, and community colleges this year alone for career and technical education initiatives. The new law gives local leaders greater freedom and flexibility than ever before to decide how best to use the federal investment in CTE to prepare young people and adults for careers. Examples of innovative ideas found in state transition plans include the following: Changing the amount of federal funding that states direct to community colleges and high schools based on labor market demands and employer needs. Building partnerships between high schools and postsecondary institutions by encouraging the submission of a single local ""consortia"" application, which allows for the pooling of resources for shared purposes. Refining definition of size, scope, and quality of career and technical education programs to incorporate more elements of the Department's Programs of Study Framework and the Association for Career and Technical Education's Definition of High-Quality CTE . Piloting online courses for students, teachers, and faculty members. Requiring that all students complete ""Individualized Success Plans."" Experimenting with competency-based learning and integrating traditional academic coursework with technical skill coursework. ""States are well on their way to realizing the promise of Perkins V,"" said Scott Stump, the Department's assistant secretary for career, technical and adult education. ""Innovations like these will expand opportunities for more of America's learners to acquire the right knowledge and skills, at the right time, for the right next step in their careers and lives."" Full four-year Perkins V state plans are due to the Office of Career, Technical, and Adult Education in April 2020. The Department will continue to provide technical assistance to states as they develop their long-term plans."

According to local school officials, the funding will be used to provide students with much needed mental health services. The district plans to hire multiple social workers and one paraprofessional for each school in the Bay district. “Hurricane Michael caused major disruptions to the lives and daily routines of students, parents and teachers alike,” said Secretary DeVos. “While the state has recovered from most of the physical damage caused by the storm, many in Bay County are still working to recover emotionally. This SERV grant will help fill that need. I want to commend Senator Rubio, Senator Scott and Governor and First Lady DeSantis for their commitment to the students of Bay County and Northwest Florida. We will continue to partner with them to ensure students get access to the resources and counseling they need to heal.” “Hurricane Michael’s damage had a tremendous impact on schools in the Florida Panhandle, which is why I asked Secretary DeVos to quickly approve these Project SERV applications,” Senator Marco Rubio said. “I applaud Secretary DeVos for getting these much needed funds to Bay County so that students can get the help they need as they and their families continue to rebuild from this terrible tragedy.” Governor DeSantis added , “Once in office, I took swift action to ensure that Bay County and Northwest Florida will fully recover from this storm. While that includes recovering from the physical damage, it also means fully recovering from the psychological damage Hurricane Michael caused. I thank the U.S. Department of Education for this grant award to help our children and schools, and I look forward to continued work with our federal partners to rebuild and restore Bay County and Northwest Florida.” First Lady Casey DeSantis says she has visited Bay County to hear first-hand from those directly affected by the hurricane. “While each experience was unique, it is clear that the pain inflicted by Michael went far beyond the physical destruction,” she said. “The invisible wounds caused by such a traumatic experience are just as serious and we must proactively address the mental health of our Northwest Florida communities, especially when it comes to our children. This Project SERV grant awarded by the U.S. Department of Education will bring essential mental health support services to the students and staff of Bay County Schools and over time help make the community whole again.” The $1,256,574 million award from the Department is the first SERV grant Florida has applied for and received for Hurricane Michael recovery efforts."

The guidance explains how ESSA changed the longstanding requirement in order to reduce administrative burden, simplify compliance, and promote effective spending. While important and well-intentioned, the supplement not supplant requirement had become restrictive and burdensome—to the point that some school districts made ineffective spending choices to avoid noncompliance. Under ESSA, the supplement not supplant requirement changed to provide more flexibility to school districts while still ensuring that federal dollars are supplemental to state and local funds, and cannot be used to replace them. “Schools need to spend resources on what’s best for students, not what’s least likely to come up in an audit,” said Secretary DeVos. “Teachers and school leaders consistently tell me the ever-growing paperwork burden is one of the biggest impediments to focusing on what really matters: the kids. This proposal does not change the legal obligations school districts have to make appropriate investments in education. It simply makes clear that a school district has significant flexibility in how it demonstrates compliance with the law.” The release of final guidance follows a 30-day public comment period during which the public submitted largely positive feedback about the draft document. One commenter described being pleased that the document adhered closely to the statute, and another commenter conveyed a belief that the document will be of major assistance to states and school districts. Other commenters requested additional descriptive detail, which, when possible, was added. All public comments were carefully considered. In order to comply with the new supplement not supplant requirement, a school district need only show that its methodology to allocate state and local resources to schools does not take into account a school’s Title I status. For many school districts, the requirement can be met using the school district’s current methodology for allocating state and local resources. To view the final document, click here ."

Compared to the previous 88-page document issued in 2012 , the new, streamlined 28-page handbook provides clearer, more concise requirements for accrediting agencies so they know what kind of and how much evidence they should submit to meet compliance requirements. “Too much of the accreditation process has become about paperwork and not people. The current process for recognizing accreditors generates accreditor applications that are tens of thousands of pages long, but it does little to improve the quality of education for students,” said Secretary DeVos. “Reducing unnecessary and burdensome bureaucracy in this area refocuses accreditor’s time and energy on what matters most – the student experience. Putting every student’s needs first in everything we do is the very core of our ‘Rethink’ agenda.” These changes respond to the President’s Executive Order 13777, Enforcing the Regulatory Reform Agenda , as well as the bipartisan Task Force on Federal Regulation of Higher Education . It also builds on recent recommendations from the Department’s Office of Inspector General , which the Department endorsed, that highlighted the need for greater clarity and clearer processes for all parties to follow. “As we seek public comment on our Accreditation Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, we have also taken a hard look at the way in which we implement our current regulations in order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the process,” Secretary DeVos added. Among other improvements, the new handbook adds a site visit by Department staff to the accreditor to allow for review of accreditor files and documents, and to obtain a more complete understanding of the accreditor’s processes and past actions. It also provides applicants with clear direction as to which documents to submit to the Department as part of their application. Today’s update to the handbook is the latest in a series of periodic revisions to help accreditors navigate accreditation regulations. The streamlined document is based on the current accreditation rules, and its use will be voluntary for agencies over the next year. The Department will publish a subsequent revision of the handbook after the publication of new accreditation regulations this fall."

Comprised of undergraduate, graduate, and professional students, Competitiveness Scholars are recognized for successfully preparing to compete for top opportunities that improve long-term outcomes. Each was nominated and endorsed by their institution President, which itself is an honorable mention. Johnathan Holifield, executive director of the Initiative, said, “The Initiative’s watchword is competitiveness and these students are fine examples of the depth and diversity of competitive talent at our institutions. We are honored to recognize them.” Scholars were selected from among several highly distinguished HBCU students chosen based on their academic achievement, campus and civic involvement and entrepreneurial ethos or ""go-getter"" spirit. In the course of their one-year term, Competitiveness Scholars will learn and share proven and promising practices that support individual and institutional achievement, with the goal of strengthening prospects for career and life success. “We’re looking forward to working with and learning from this new cohort of HBCU Competitiveness Scholars,” said Elyse Jones, the Initiative’s coordinator for the Scholars Program. “We have lots of unique, fun and interactive opportunities planned for this year that will provide new opportunities for these representatives, exposing them to critical national conversations and powerful thought leaders.” Billy Hawkins, president of Talladega College and a member of the President’s Board of Advisors on HBCUs, said, “Over my career, I’ve learned a lot about leadership from HBCU students. Recognition programs such as the Competitiveness Scholars showcase the talent, leadership and spirit of students at Talladega College and across the HBCU landscape. Congratulations to the 2019 cohort – we’re looking for great things from you.” Rodney Ellis, chancellor of Southern University at Shreveport and a member of the President’s Board of Advisors on HBCUs, added, “Academics, civic engagement, entrepreneurship and leadership are achieved through action, not position. Congratulations to the students from the Southern University System and other HBCUs for taking the necessary actions and leveraging their positions as students to achieve impact.” Competitiveness Scholars will assemble during the 2019 National HBCU Week Conference, Sept. 8-11 at the Renaissance Washington DC Hotel – the theme of which is Enhancing HBCU Competitiveness: Student Achievement. Quality Partnerships. Institutional Performance. They will participate in workshops designed to strengthen their leadership, wealth creation and management and civic engagement and will be encouraged to seek out ongoing personal and professional development in the areas of innovation and entrepreneurship. Competitiveness Scholars are recognized for the 2019-2020 academic school year. Throughout this period, the Initiative will facilitate engagement activities, as well as provide information and resources that scholars can take advantage of or disseminate to fellow students. Scholars are encouraged to fully take advantage of the opportunities provided, engage with one another and showcase their individual and collective talents across the HBCU spectrum. Competitiveness Scholars will receive their recognition at the HBCU week conference during the Initiative's Excellence in Innovation and Competitiveness Awards luncheon ceremony on Sept. 9.

This week's actions demonstrate that this Administration continues to listen to students and taxpayers. One of the most important aspects of the final rules and additional guidance will be to ensure taxpayers who choose to donate to state tax-credit scholarships are not penalized. ""We are deeply grateful to the families, donors, non-profits, and state and federal policymakers who raised their voices about the benefits of education freedom and who articulated the unintended consequences of the proposed rule during the public comment process. The final rules and additional guidance announced this week are fair to students and taxpayers alike."""

These changes, which were developed by consensus from a diverse negotiated rulemaking panel earlier this year, are designed to promote innovation, protect students while ensuring they have access to the higher education options that meet their unique needs, and reduce irrelevant and overburdensome regulations on higher education institutions. ""Reaching consensus on accreditation reform shows that, despite the naysayers, we can work together to rethink higher education, protect students through meaningful accountability, support innovative and diverse educational options, and allow colleges and universities to be more responsive to students' educational needs and career aspirations,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""With these reforms, our nation's colleges and universities can spend more time and effort on serving students and less time, energy, and money focused on bureaucratic compliance. At the Department, we will ensure that accreditation demonstrates a college or university is effectively serving students in accordance with its unique mission, including religious mission, rather than that it has simply filled out enough paperwork."" The consensus language also simplifies state authorization requirements for distance education and correspondence courses offered by schools, allowing colleges and universities to focus their resources on their students rather than hard-to-understand regulatory requirements and costly state fees. The Department's proposed regulations would provide students with more options to take classes that prepare them for lifelong learning, as well as a career. For example: Students enrolled in programs that lead to occupational licensure—whether enrolled online or in ground-based programs—would know whether the program satisfies the requirements of various states. Students would be put first and given more options to complete their degree when a college or university closes. Students, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds, would have greater opportunities, as the proposed rules discourage entrenched interests from trying to close doors to careers through credential inflation. The public will now have an opportunity to weigh in on the proposed regulations, which the Department plans to finalize this fall. The 30-day period for public comment will begin when the regulations are officially published in the Federal Register this week. To view the proposed rule in its entirety, click here . The Department will also soon publish proposed rules that capture the consensus agreements on topics related to distance education and innovation, as well as TEACH grants and faith-based institutions."

The students come from more than 25,000 public, private and military schools from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Outlying Areas—American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands—and American military bases abroad. ""The President and I are honored to celebrate your accomplishments and join your family and community in honoring you,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. ""By setting goals for your education and working hard to reach them, you are building a bright future for yourself and inspiring others to following their own paths to success."" PEAP was founded in 1983. Every year since then, the program has provided our nation's schools with the opportunity to recognize graduating students who meet high standards of academic excellence and those who have given their best effort, often overcoming obstacles to their learning. Each year, eligible graduating K-12 students are selected by their school principal for recognition in two categories: The President's Award for Educational Excellence —This award recognizes academic success in the classroom. To be eligible, students must meet requirements, including grade point average or other school-set criteria and choice of state tests or teacher recommendations. The President's Award for Educational Achievement —This award recognizes students that show outstanding educational growth, improvement, commitment or intellectual development in their academic subjects but do not meet the criteria for the Educational Excellence Award. Its purpose is to encourage and reward students who give their best effort, often in the face of special obstacles. Criterion for this award is developed at each school. Individual recognition is bestowed by the President and the U.S. Secretary of Education, in partnership with the National Association of Elementary School Principals and the National Association of Secondary School Principals. The award includes a congratulatory letter to the student and certificate signed by the President, the Secretary, and the school principal. Unlike other awards programs, the principal has sole discretion in choosing recipients based on eligibility. There is no limit on the number of awards, as long as students meet the criteria for each award set by the school.

The tool now includes information on 2,100 additional postsecondary education options and more comprehensive information about graduation rates. The Department is also releasing preliminary information on student loan debt by field of study available to download. ""We committed to students that we would continually improve the College Scorecard so that they could access relevant, accurate and actionable data as they make decisions about their education after high school,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""The updates released today are another step in fulfilling that promise. We look forward to seeing how students, parents, institutions and researchers utilize this important information."" For the first time, the College Scorecard consumer tool now has information on 2,100 non-degree granting institutions (institutions that only award certificates). Adding these types of institutions into the consumer site gives prospective students and their advocates a more complete sense of all their postsecondary options. Previously, the Scorecard consumer site provided profiles for approximately 3,700 degree-granting institutions. The College Scorecard now also includes information on graduation rates for non-first-time and non-full-time students and the percentage of students who transferred or were still enrolled in school. Previously, the consumer site only presented graduation rates for first-time full-time students which may not be representative of all students at many institutions. The Department also updated the College Scorecard to include the most recent data for key metrics such as average annual cost, graduation rate, and student demographics and other data from the National Center for Education Statistics' (NCES) Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) . Since 2015, the Scorecard provided data updates each fall with the last major update conducted in September 2018. Based on user feedback, the Department transitioned to updating major data metrics multiple times throughout the year when subsets of data become available. Finally, building on President Trump's March 2019 Executive Order on Improving Free Inquiry, Transparency, and Accountability at Colleges and Universities , the College Scorecard released new preliminary loan debt data by field of study to the College Scorecard data webpage. For years, the College Scorecard provided undergraduate loan debt information at only the institution-level even though the amount borrowed to attend school can vary substantially depending on which program the borrower is enrolled. Institutions are being asked to update their historical enrollment data from which these loan debt metrics are derived. These adjustments will be reflected in a subsequent release of loan debt data metrics by field of study this fall. For prospective students, families, researchers and others interested in examining loan debt data by field of study, please note that the data released today are considered preliminary and future improved versions will be calculated after institutions have time to adjust their historical enrollment data."

The new Federal Work-Study (FWS) Experiment will provide institutions with increased flexibilities that will enable students to earn work-study benefits while participating in apprenticeships, internships and work-based learning programs, as well as earn work-study wages while completing required clinical rotations, externships and student teaching. “For decades, the Federal Work-Study program has allowed students to support themselves while earning a college degree, but for too long, the majority of the work options students have had access to have been irrelevant to their chosen field of study,” said Secretary DeVos. “That will change with this experimental site. We want all students to have access to relevant earn-and-learn experiences that will prepare them for future employment.” The Secretary also announced today the Department will expand the Second Chance Pell experiment by allowing new cohorts of colleges and universities to participate. This important experiment has already provided a number of students with new educational opportunities that prepare them for college and workplace success. Adding additional students and institutions to the experiment will help to improve the Department’s ability to evaluate the program’s effectiveness. “We are eager to expand the Second Chance Pell experiment, which has shown significant promise,” said Secretary DeVos. “We hope that through this expansion, we can reach more students and utilize the information gathered to better inform Congress about future updates to the Higher Education Act .” The Federal Work-Study Experiment This new experiment will test the effectiveness of engaging more students in private-sector employment, increasing the number of work-based learning opportunities available to students and providing greater flexibility in the number of hours a student may work. Additionally, the experiment will measure the effectiveness of improving student retention and completion, increasing student work-readiness, and improving post-graduate employment opportunities. Under the current FWS program, nearly 92 percent of all funds are spent to support students in on-campus employment, while just over eight percent support students working for non-profit organizations. Less than one-tenth of one percent, or just $726,000 of the billion-dollar FWS program, are spent to support students in private-sector employment, where many students are likely to seek permanent employment. The experiment will eliminate a number of the barriers that made engagement with private-sector employers undesirable for many colleges and universities. Under this experiment, an institution is no longer limited in the amount of its FWS funding it can allocate to private-sector employers, and it will remove other requirements related to community service work opportunities. The experiment also will study the impact of paying students engaged in required externships, clinical rotations or student teaching on factors such as completion, student satisfaction and reduced borrowing. The Department will increase the amount of Job Location and Development (JLD) funds available to institutions participating in the experiment to assist them in fostering long-term partnerships with employers that can benefit FWS and non-FWS students alike. The experiment will allow institutions to use JLD funds to retain apprenticeship intermediaries to help increase the number of apprenticeship opportunities available to students. Apprenticeship intermediaries are organizations or firms that work with employers to help them identify potential apprentices and screen them according to the employer’s needs, develop on-the-job training materials, assess apprenticeship performance and/or work with partnering education providers to ensure that classroom learning and on-the-job training are aligned. [1] Finally, the experiment will reduce the wage share for certain private-sector employers—such as small businesses—to equal that of non-profit employers. It is a myth that all non-profit organizations are financially disadvantaged, and all private-sector organizations are financially flush. Therefore, it does not make sense to require a higher wage share of a small start-up company than is required of a large, well-funded, non-profit organization. The Department hopes that employers that benefit from wage subsidies through the FWS program will be more generous in covering the cost of tuition and fees or in providing other benefits to students. The goal is to produce spillover effects that engage employers more actively in curriculum and program review. The experiment will allow institutions to offer many of the same advantages to small, private-sector employers that institutions already offer to non-profit organizations, and it will facilitate the development of new partnerships between employers and institutions to ensure that students leave college well-prepared to enter the workforce. The experiment will be rigorously evaluated by comparing results between similar groups of institutions and/or students to determine potential benefits or drawbacks related to employment outcomes, the development of workforce partnerships, and other goals. The Second Chance Pell Experiment This experiment provides need-based Pell Grants to individuals incarcerated in state and federal prisons so that they can enroll in postsecondary programs offered by local colleges and universities. Currently, there are 64 schools in 26 states participating in this experiment. In 2015, more than 200 schools submitted applications seeking to participate. The goal is to give more institutions a chance to participate. In the first two years, 40 institutions were awarded approximately $35.6 million in Pell Grants to about 8,800 incarcerated students. Institutions offered more than 1,000 different courses with an average of 19 per site. To date, 954 credentials have been awarded, including credentials to 578 individuals while they were incarcerated, and 34 to those who completed their program after returning to their community. According to a recent study by the Vera Institute, incarcerated individuals who participate in prison education programs are 43 percent less likely to return to prison than those who do not. Although some of the students enrolled in these programs are pursuing career and technical education, others are pursuing general studies and liberal arts degrees. About the Experimental Sites Initiative The Experimental Sites Initiative (ESI) is a limited waiver authority provided under the Higher Education Act (HEA) to evaluate new policy ideas for potential broader applicability. Under the ESI, the Secretary has authority to grant waivers of certain federal student aid program statutory or regulatory requirements to allow a limited number of institutions to participate in experiments to test alternative methods of administering the federal student aid programs.

""I want to congratulate this year's class of Presidential Scholars on their achievement both inside of the classroom and out,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. ""Their hard work and commitment to excellence, no matter what challenge they are tackling, will serve them well throughout their lifelong learning journeys. I have no doubt that many of tomorrow's leaders are among this year's class of Scholars."" The White House Commission on Presidential Scholars selects scholars annually based on their academic success, artistic and technical excellence, essays, school evaluations and transcripts, as well as evidence of community service, leadership and demonstrated commitment to high ideals. Of the 3.6 million students expected to graduate from high school this year, more than 5,200 candidates qualified for the 2019 awards determined by outstanding performance on the College Board SAT and ACT exams or through nominations made by Chief State School Officers , other partner recognition organizations and the National YoungArts Foundation's nationwide YoungArts™ competition . As directed by Presidential Executive Order, the 2019 U.S. Presidential Scholars are comprised of one young man and one young woman from each state, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, and U.S. families living abroad, as well as 15 chosen at-large, 20 Scholars in the Arts and 20 Scholars in Career and Technical Education. Created in 1964, the U.S. Presidential Scholars Program has honored over 7,500 of the nation's top-performing students with an annual ceremony in Washington, D.C. The program was expanded in 1979 to recognize students who demonstrate exceptional talent in the visual, literary and performing arts. In 2015, the program was again extended to recognize students who demonstrate ability and accomplishment in career and technical education fields. The 2019 ceremony will be held June 23, when each honoree will receive a Presidential Scholar Medallion.

Matt Bevin, announced today that Marshall County School District (MCSD) in Kentucky has been awarded a second Project School Emergency Response to Violence (SERV) grant totaling $460,064. This grant will assist MCSD in its continued recovery efforts following the Jan. 23, 2018, shooting that took the lives of two students and injured 14 others. ""I'm inspired today by the resolve and determination of the students in this community,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""While the road to recovering following a tragedy like the one you all have endured is a long one, we at the Department are committed to being a partner in that recovery. I'm grateful to Gov. Bevin for his continued commitment to improving school safety, and we know that this second allocation of Project SERV funds will be utilized in a way that helps students and teachers continue to heal and feel safer at school."" According to education officials in Kentucky, the Project SERV grant will be used to hire additional school resource officers, hall monitors and a school nurse. The funds will also be used to allow students who are not yet ready to return to school to continue their studies through an at-home, online program. ""We are grateful to Secretary DeVos and the U.S. Department of Education for another significant grant allocation in support of the Marshall County community,"" said Gov. Bevin. ""Following the tragic events of January 2018, West Kentuckians showcased to the world their exceptional strength, faith and resiliency. Our Commonwealth continues to stand united with the students, educators and families of MCHS, as we utilize every potential resource available to help them heal and move forward together."" The Marshall County School District was previously awarded a Project SERV grant totaling $138,213."

Matt Bevin and Kentucky Education Commissioner Wayne Lewis for a conversation on education freedom and the importance of giving every student in Kentucky the opportunity to access the education option that works best for them. The Secretary, Governor and Commissioner hosted more than 20 families, educators, stakeholders and elected officials at the Newtown campus of Bluegrass Community Technical College for the roundtable discussion. The participants discussed the Secretary’s Education Freedom Scholarship proposal and how these scholarships could expand education opportunities in the state. “I am encouraged to see leaders like Gov. Bevin and Commissioner Lewis working to expand education opportunities in their state,” said Secretary DeVos. “They are dedicated to rethinking education and improving outcomes for all students. “During our roundtable, we received great feedback on our Education Freedom Scholarships proposal,” Secretary DeVos added. “If passed, Kentucky could receive up to $72 million for scholarships for students. These funds could be used for a myriad of opportunities, including access to apprenticeship programs, summer and afterschool education programs, or transportation to and out of district public schools. The sky is truly the limit as leaders here in Kentucky assess their students’ needs and how best to utilize this additional money to meet those needs.” Gov. Bevin stated, “We are grateful to Secretary DeVos for her visit to Kentucky today and for her strong advocacy for education reform nationwide. In the Commonwealth, we are striving to equip every single child with the best possible opportunity to succeed, and we appreciate the U.S. Department of Education’s partnership in this vital endeavor.” Commissioner Lewis added, “If passed by Congress, Education Freedom Scholarships could be used to advance the Kentucky Department of Education’s priorities, namely increasing participation in high-quality, early-learning experiences and increasing student access to dual credit coursework and career and technical education courses and programs. We have made a lot of progress but we still have work to do to ensure every Kentucky student—regardless of district, background, or disability status—has access to the rigorous, high-quality programs and courses needed to prepare them for success in postsecondary education and the workforce.” Today’s event in Kentucky is one of many the Secretary plans to host around the country to highlight the benefits of expanding education freedom through the Education Freedom Scholarships proposal.

This guide, produced jointly by the Department's Office of Elementary and Secondary Education and Office for Special Education and Rehabilitative Services, provides best practices and includes resources school leaders and teachers can utilize as they work to achieve a positive school climate, lower disciplinary issues and enhance school safety. ""We know that fostering a positive school climate is critical to the well-being, safety and long-term success of all students,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""In the absence of a safe and positive learning environment, a student may feel disconnected, disregard consequences, and engage in bullying or other destructive behaviors. As teachers and school leaders assess the unique needs of their school communities, we hope this guide helps them make the decisions that are right for their students and also provides parents and guardians with effective tools to support teachers in making those decisions."" The Q&A; document, which is available on the Department of Education's website, provides parents and educators with useful decision-making frameworks and implementation tools, as well as best practices that school leaders can consider as they work to foster positive and inclusive learning environments. Examples from schools across the country are included to illustrate the various interventions communities are employing to enhance student behavior and achievement. With recent research highlighting the importance of evaluating school climate through a range of indicators, the guide provides diagnostic tools so educators can collect and utilize data to drive their climate improvement strategy. Additionally, the Parent and Educator Guide to School Climate Resources provides information to teachers and school leaders on how they can receive support from the Department's two technical assistance centers dedicated to promoting safe and supportive schools, including the National Center of Safe and Supportive Learning Environments ( https://safesupportivelearning.ed.gov ), and the Technical Assistance Center on Positive Behavioral Interventions and Sup­ports ( www.pbis.org ). The guide includes an appendix of additional resources spanning the work of government agencies and private organizations, equipping parents and educators to create positive learning environments for all students.

The package of higher education regulations is aimed at rethinking higher education to improve outcomes and accountability for students, institutions and taxpayers. The draft regulations, which will next be published for public comment, come after months of negotiated rulemaking that engaged a wide variety of higher education stakeholders. “Today’s historic action proves just how much can be accomplished on behalf of students when we put their needs above all else,” said Secretary DeVos. “Rethinking higher education required each person at the negotiating table to challenge assumptions and examine past practice in order to better serve students. I commend them for doing just that. “The committee recognized that higher education has changed in many ways since the last reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, including in the use of innovative technologies. These changes will allow students to work at their own pace to earn a college degree, obtain credit for proving what they already know and earn a credential aligned with employers’ job requirements. The new policies and procedures will also work against unnecessary credential inflation that drives up cost and reduces the opportunity for low-income students to prepare for certain jobs. “These much-needed reforms will promote competition and raise standards for our accreditors, ensure that teachers get the proper credit for service in high-need fields, restore respect for an institution’s mission, particularly faith-based institutions, put more teeth into teach-out plans and agreements to protect students from precipitous closures and engage employers more fully to ensure that the workforce elements of higher education align with employer needs. “Everyone at the negotiating table -- students, employers, veterans, accreditors, financial aid administrators, student legal aid organizations, and minority-serving, faith-based, online, two-year and four-year, public, non-profit and proprietary colleges and universities -- overcame the naysayers to achieve consensus. I want to thank all of the negotiators and our entire team for their hard work and congratulate them on a job well done.”"

The Secretary and Governor hosted more than 30 families, educators, stakeholders and elected officials at the Tennessee State Capitol building to discuss the recently announced Education Freedom Scholarships policy proposal, answer questions on the plan and engage on how these scholarships could help enhance school choice efforts in the state. During the meeting, Secretary DeVos praised Tennessee's current work to expand education options for families and encouraged the stakeholders in attendance to continue their involvement in rethinking education in their communities. ""I'm pleased to see education leaders in Tennessee willing to act boldly on behalf of their students,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""Governor Lee is passionate about improving education outcomes and is working hard to introduce creative changes to the current system. Expanding access to Education Savings Accounts and to innovative charter schools would truly empower more parents to create the custom education experience best suited for their child. ""During our roundtable, we also received a lot of positive feedback on our Education Freedom Scholarships proposal which would truly compliment the in-demand, state-based reforms taking shape here. Scholarships, which could total more than $100 million for Tennessee students, could be used to expand students' access to dual enrollment courses, apprenticeship programs, transportation to an out of district public school, or other education opportunities. I look forward to seeing how this proposal, coupled with the important reforms taking shape in Tennessee will give each child access to an education that is personalized for them, unleashes their creativity, and unlocks their potential."" Governor Lee stated, ""Working to provide our kids the best possible education is something we all must strive for, and in Tennessee, we are doing everything we can to provide high-quality options for every student. I thank Sec. DeVos for coming to Tennessee today to help champion reforms and put a focus on students at the national level."" The roundtable participants shared stories from their communities and gave examples of how this program could benefit them, as well as addressed the shortcomings and challenges the current system has placed on families. Following the roundtable, Secretary DeVos and Governor Lee visited LEAD Cameron, a public charter middle school in Nashville with a proven turnaround success story. According to school leadership, LEAD Cameron has moved from one of the state's lowest performing ""Priority Schools"" to currently ranking in the top five percent for academic growth. The Secretary will continue to travel around the country to tout the benefits of Education Freedom Scholarships and to explain how they can complement state-based education choice policies making their way through state legislatures.

""Make no mistake: we are focused every day on raising expectations and improving outcomes for infants and toddlers, children and youth with disabilities, and are committed to confronting and addressing anything that stands in the way of their success. ""The President's budget reflects that commitment. It supports our nation's 7 million students with disabilities through a $13.2 billion request for IDEA funding, the same funding level appropriated by Congress. All of that money goes directly to states to ensure students with disabilities have the resources and supports they need. The budget also requests an additional $225.6 million for competitively awarded grants to support teacher preparation, research and technical assistance to support students with disabilities. ""The Special Olympics is not a federal program. It's a private organization. I love its work, and I have personally supported its mission. Because of its important work, it is able to raise more than $100 million every year. There are dozens of worthy nonprofits that support students and adults with disabilities that don't get a dime of federal grant money. But given our current budget realities, the federal government cannot fund every worthy program, particularly ones that enjoy robust support from private donations."""

President Donald J. Trump's Executive Order on ‘Improving Free Inquiry, Transparency, and Accountability at Colleges and Universities' once again demonstrates this Administration's commitment to supporting and empowering students with meaningful resources as they pursue their life-long learning journeys and future careers. ""Per the Executive Order, the Department will continue its efforts to update the College Scorecard so that it includes clear information on the cost of college, expected earnings after graduation, and student loan repayment rates. We will also continue our Federal Student Aid modernization efforts that began with the launch of our first ever mobile app. Right now, students can use the app to complete the FAFSA . And, building on the President's directive, the app's capabilities will expand to give students access to information about loan balances, payments, and repayment options right at their fingertips. We believe that these important reforms, along with the Department's ambitious negotiated rulemaking agenda, will make college more affordable, break down barriers to innovation in higher education, and encourage new approaches and new partnerships for the benefit of students. ""As students pursue their education, they should never face limits on what, when, where, or how they learn. They should be empowered to pursue truth through the free exchange of all ideas, especially ideas with which they may not agree. Free inquiry is an essential feature of our democracy, and I applaud the President's continued support for America's students."""

Right now, there are 7.3 million unfilled jobs in the United States, yet too many Americans remain out of the workforce because they lack the skills necessary to seize these opportunities. We must do better for our students and workers. There should be multiple educational pathways to a successful career, and the federal government shouldn't pick winners and losers amongst them. At the same time, higher education should be more affordable, nimble and relevant. Institutions of higher education need to be freed-up to implement new ideas that could fill the many gaps between education and the economy. The Department of Education is currently leading that effort through ambitious negotiated rulemaking which seeks to break down the barriers to innovation in higher education and encourage new approaches and new partnerships. ""The higher education reform principles released today provide an important roadmap for working with Congress to rethink higher education and pass meaningful reforms. Ideas like simplifying loan repayment, short-term and second-chance Pell and streamlining the FAFSA are common-sense, bipartisan and should be passed immediately. ""I thank President Trump for his leadership on this critical issue, and I look forward to working with Congress on improving educational opportunities for all of America's students."""

The U.S. Department of Education, in consultation with the U.S. Department of Justice, determined the statutory provisions in Section 1117(d)(2)(B) and 8501(d)(2)(B) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) that require an equitable services provider to “be independent of … any religious organization” are unconstitutional because they categorically exclude religious organizations based solely on their religious identity. These provisions run counter to the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer, 137 S. Ct. 2012 (2017) that, under the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, otherwise eligible recipients cannot be disqualified from a public benefit solely because of their religious character. Given this decision, the Department will no longer enforce these provisions that previously restricted school districts from contracting with religious organizations to provide equitable services on the same basis as any other organization. “The Trinity Lutheran decision reaffirmed the long-understood intent of the First Amendment to not restrict the free exercise of religion,” said Secretary DeVos. “Those seeking to provide high-quality educational services to students and teachers should not be discriminated against simply based on the religious character of their organization.” The Department will continue to enforce all other applicable provisions of federal law. In particular, under ESEA Sections 1117(a)(2) and 8501(a)(2), school districts must continue to ensure that any contractor is independent of the private school for which it is providing services and that the educational services and other benefits being provided by the contractor are “secular, neutral and non-ideological.”"

This budget reflects the Administration's continued commitment to expanding education freedom, protecting our nation's most vulnerable students, ensuring school safety and returning power over education decisions to those closest to students. And, for the first time, the budget proposes an innovative approach to providing teachers the freedom and flexibility to chart their own course for professional development through teacher vouchers. ""This budget at its core is about education freedom—freedom for America's students to pursue their life-long learning journeys in the ways and places that work best for them, freedom for teachers to develop their talents and pursue their passions and freedom from the top-down 'Washington knows best' approach that has proven ineffective and even harmful to students,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. ""I've spoken with hundreds of teachers as I've traveled across the country and hosted teacher roundtables at the Department, and I heard far too often how limited most teachers are in their own professional development. They have little to no say in the courses they take. They have very little freedom to explore subject areas that interest them. And, too many of our nation's teachers, don't have access to high quality mentoring or residency programs. I'm excited about the teacher voucher program included in this budget that not only provides much needed freedom and flexibility for teachers, but also respects them as the professionals they are. ""This budget also reflects this Administration's continued commitment to ensuring our nation's students are safe at school. While there is no one-size-fits all solution to preventing school violence, the Administration's proposal ensures states and local leaders have the resources they need to develop their own safety plans. ""We have also reaffirmed our commitment to spending taxpayer dollars wisely and efficiently by consolidating or eliminating duplicative and ineffective federal programs. Tough decisions were made, but we made sure that this budget protects our most vulnerable students by requesting level-funding for Title I and IDEA. ""I look forward to working with Congress to pass a budget that truly puts the needs of students, parents, teachers and local leaders first, because it is my sincere belief that if we give them the freedom to break free from the one-size-fits-all 'school system,' we will truly begin to unleash our nation's full potential."" Highlights from the President's FY 2020 Budget Request include: 1. Education freedom for more of our nation’s students Education Freedom Scholarships (EFS) would provide up to $5 billion in extra education funding to help students across the country access the education that is right for them.

Ted Cruz (R-TX) and U.S. Rep. Bradley Byrne (R-AL), unveiled Education Freedom Scholarships (EFS), the Trump Administration's key proposal to expand and improve the education options available to students across the country. The policy will make a historic investment in America's students, injecting up to $5 billion yearly into locally controlled scholarship programs that empower students to choose the learning environment and style that best meets their unique needs. The policy would not rely on any funds currently allocated to public education, nor would it create a new federal education program. Participation would be voluntary for students, schools, and states. ""I believe every student in America deserves the opportunity to pursue the education that best meets his or her needs,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""No student should feel stuck in a school that just isn't working for them, or feel hopeless because they live on the 'wrong' side of town. Education Freedom Scholarships will finally give students the opportunity to learn in places and grow in ways that have too often been denied to them. This historic investment in students honors the fact that each one of them is unique and deserves an education that's personalized for them, unleashes their creativity, and unlocks their potential."" EFS will be funded through taxpayers' voluntary contributions to state‐identified Scholarship Granting Organizations (SGOs). Those taxpayers will then receive a non‐refundable, dollar‐for‐dollar federal tax credit. EFS will not create a new federal education program but instead will allow states to decide whether to participate and how to select eligible students, education providers, and allowable education expenses. ""The key element of the proposal is freedom for all involved,"" Secretary DeVos added. ""Students, families, teachers, schools, states—all can participate, if they choose, and do so in the ways that work best for them. The major shift is that a student's needs and preferences, not their address or family income, will determine the type and quality of education they can pursue."" Some of the ways states could potentially expand students' access to educational opportunities include but are not limited to: Advanced, remedial, and elective courses; Apprenticeships and industry certifications; Concurrent and dual enrollment; Private and home education; Special education services and therapies; Transportation to education providers outside of a family's zoned school; Tutoring, especially for students in low‐performing schools; and Summer and after-school education programs. ""A quality education is the gateway to the American dream and stable, family-sustaining employment,"" Sen. Cruz said. ""The Education Freedom Scholarships and Opportunity Act will drive increased investment in our students by creating a federal tax credit for taxpayers that donate to scholarship organizations. Our bill enables all students to access a personalized education experience that meets their individual needs by providing access to scholarships for private and home education; apprenticeships, industry certifications, concurrent and dual enrollment; tutoring; educational therapy; after-school education programs; transportation; and more."" Rep. Byrne added, ""Every student in America should have the opportunity to receive a high-quality education, and we can help accomplish that goal through a new federal tax credit. This model has succeeded at creating opportunity for students in my home state of Alabama, and I am hopeful through this legislation that we can create similar opportunities for students around the country. I applaud the leadership of President Trump and Secretary DeVos to expand choice and freedom in education, and I am committed to working with them and Sen. Cruz to see this legislation across the finish line."" For more information on EFS, please visit www.ed.gov/freedom ."

The Federal Commission on School Safety (FCSS) released an in-depth report last December, which observed that “substantial misunderstanding remains at the local level among officials and educators concerning (FERPA), and in particular its application to school-based threats.” This FAQ document, titled, School Resource Officers, School Law Enforcement Units and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) , consolidates previously issued guidance and technical assistance into a single resource to help raise schools’ and districts’ awareness of these provisions. ""One key takeaway from the commission’s work was that the federal government needs to do a much better job of providing useable information that’s simple, streamlined and clear,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""FERPA is an area where widespread confusion remains, and this clarification will give local school leaders and law enforcement the tools they need to protect student privacy while ensuring the health and safety of students and others in the school community."" The document consists of 37 commonly asked questions about schools’ and school districts’ responsibilities under FERPA relating to disclosures of student information to school resource officers (SROs), law enforcement units and others, and seeks to explain and clarify how FERPA protects student privacy while ensuring the health and safety of students and others in the school community. The FAQ document includes answers to common FERPA questions involving school safety, such as: Can law enforcement unit officials who are off-duty police officers or SROs be considered school officials under FERPA and, therefore, have access to students’ education records? Does FERPA permit schools and districts to disclose education records, without consent, to outside law-enforcement officials who serve on a school’s threat assessment team? When is it permissible for schools or districts to disclose student education records under FERPA’s health or safety emergency exception? Does FERPA permit school officials to release information that they personally observed or of which they have personal knowledge? The full FAQ document can be found here .

Trump reaffirmed his commitment to expanding education freedom and empowering every student with opportunities to learn where and how works best. U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos released the following statement on the President's remarks: ""Too many American students are far too limited by the current education 'system' that assigns them to a school building based solely on where they live. That means their family income largely dictates their education options. But the freedom to choose the right education should not only be for the rich, powerful and connected. All students should have the freedom to pursue an education that develops their talents, unleashes their unique potential and prepares them for a successful life. ""The President was exactly right tonight to remind the nation of his call to expand education freedom. I look forward to continuing to work with Congress on ways to give students opportunities to pursue the education that engages their curiosity, unlocks their creativity and empowers them to reach their fullest potential. It's time to do what's best for kids and get to work."""

The guidance explains how ESSA changed the longstanding requirement in order to reduce administrative burden, simplify the compliance demonstration and promote effective spending. While important and well-intentioned, the supplement not supplant requirement had become restrictive and burdensome—to the point that some school districts made ineffective spending choices in an effort to avoid noncompliance. Under ESSA, the supplement not supplant requirement changed to provide more flexibility to school districts while still ensuring that federal dollars are supplemental to state and local funds and cannot be used to replace them. ""Schools need to spend resources on what's best for students, not what's least likely to come up in an audit,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""Teachers and school leaders consistently tell me the ever-growing paperwork burden is one of the biggest impediments to focusing on what really matters: the kids. This proposal does not change the legal obligations school districts have to make appropriate investments in education. It simply makes clear that a school district has significant flexibility in how it demonstrates compliance with the law."" In order to comply, a school district need only show that its methodology to allocate state and local resources to schools does not take into account a school's Title I status. For many school districts, the requirement can be met using the school district's current methodology for allocating state and local resources. There will be a public comment period of 30 days to allow educators, parents and others to provide feedback on the draft non-regulatory guidance document.

The Office for Civil Rights (OCR), in partnership with the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS), will oversee this proactive approach which will protect students with disabilities by providing technical assistance and support to schools, districts, and state education agencies, and strengthen enforcement activities. “This initiative will not only allow us to support children with disabilities, but will also provide technical assistance to help meet the professional learning needs of those within the system serving students,” Secretary DeVos said. “The only way to ensure the success of all children with disabilities is to meet the needs of each child with a disability. This initiative furthers that important mission.” The Department’s Initiative to Address the Inappropriate Use of Restraint and Seclusion will not only include components that help schools and districts understand how federal law applies to the use of restraint and seclusion, but the Department will also support schools seeking resources and information on the appropriate use of interventions and supports to address the behavioral needs of students with disabilities. The Department’s initiative will include the following three components: Compliance Reviews OCR’s 12 regional offices will conduct compliance reviews on recipients’ use of restraint and seclusion on children with disabilities. Compliance reviews will focus on the possible inappropriate use of restraint and seclusion, and the effect of such practices on the school’s obligation to provide a free appropriate public education (FAPE) for all children with disabilities. OCR will conduct compliance reviews and work with public schools to correct noncompliance. CRDC Data Collection OCR will conduct data quality reviews and work directly with school districts to review and improve restraint and seclusion data submitted as a part of the Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC). OCR will provide technical assistance to schools on data quality, to ensure that they are collecting and reporting accurate data relating to the use of restraint and seclusion. Support for Recipients OCR will provide technical assistance to public schools on the legal requirements of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act relating to the use of restraint and seclusion on children with disabilities. OCR will partner with OSERS to provide joint technical assistance to support recipients in understanding how Section 504, Title II, and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) informs the development and implementation of policies governing the use of restraint and seclusion. OSERS will support recipients identified by OCR through compliance reviews or through the complaint resolution process to ensure they have access to appropriate technical assistance and support. OSERS will support schools to ensure they have access to technical assistance and available resources as they establish or enhance environments where the implementation of interventions and supports reduces the need for reliance on less effective and potentially dangerous practices. OSERS will consider how current investments may be utilized to provide support and training to schools, districts, and states. OSERS and OCR will jointly plan and conduct webinars for interested parties related to the use of appropriate interventions and supports for all students. “In collaboration with OSERS, we will work to ensure that recipients are aware of their legal obligation under Section 504 and Title II, and that we have accurate information and data on the use of restraint and seclusion,” said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Kenneth L. Marcus. “Working directly with schools and districts provides an excellent opportunity to help recipients and support their efforts toward compliance to ensure that all children have an opportunity to succeed in the classroom.” “OSERS has long focused on improving results and outcomes for children with disabilities,” said Assistant Secretary for Special Education and Rehabilitative Services Johnny W. Collett. “Rethinking special education and challenging the status quo includes examining systems that keep us from making the kind of improvement we know is necessary. This initiative furthers our ongoing efforts to examine any practice that limits opportunities for children with disabilities.”"

In making its final determination, FSA reviewed carefully the Department’s Office of Inspector General’s (OIG) report, examined WGU’s records regarding interactions between students and academic staff during the year audited, and also reviewed the favorable findings of WGU’s accrediting agency regarding the institution’s academic model. FSA determined that, particularly in light of a lack of clear guidance from the Department at the time of the audit period, WGU’s efforts to comply with the governing law and regulations were reasonable and undertaken in good faith. OIG ultimately agreed with FSA’s issuance of the final audit determination. FSA’s final audit determination comes after OIG performed an audit on WGU and concluded the university should return $712 million in federal student aid funds that it had received after purportedly being ineligible. The OIG’s audit covered the period from July 1, 2013, through June 30, 2014, and concerned WGU’s online competency-based academic model and the amount of interaction that occurred between students and instructional staff at WGU. WGU’s model relies on the use of student mentors to engage with students on a regular basis. Students at WGU do not attend scheduled classes and instead learn at their own pace, earning credit only when they demonstrate mastery of the competencies in the program. FSA’s final determination is a culmination of an audit resolution process in which the OIG issues its final audit report (which contains findings and recommendations to FSA), and FSA drafts a final audit determination, which is reviewed by the Office of Inspector General. While the Department has since clarified the eligibility issues in this audit through guidance issued in December 2014, the topic of distance learning is being addressed as part of a Department negotiated rule-making session starting on Monday. The Department is hopeful that further clarification will be part of future regulations that will help spur the growth of high-quality innovative programs.

Utilizing the information gathered, the Commission report offers a holistic approach to improving school safety, ranging from supporting the social and emotional well-being of students to enhancing physical building security. Acknowledging there can be no one-size-fits-all solution to this complex problem, the final report serves as a resource guide for families, educators, law enforcement officers, health professionals, and elected leaders to use as they consider the best ways to prevent, mitigate, and recover from acts of violence in schools. The recommendations are based on efforts that are already working in states and local communities. ""Each of us has an important role to play in keeping our students safe while at school,"" said Chair of the Federal Commission on School Safety and U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos . ""Through the Commission's work, it has become even clearer there is no single policy that will make our schools safer. What will work for schools in Montana will be different than what will work for schools in Manhattan. With that in mind, this report provides a wide-ranging menu of best practices and resources that all state, community, and school leaders should consider while developing school safety plans and procedures that will work for their students and teachers."" Acting Attorney General Matthew G. Whitaker said, ""The Trump administration is taking action to prevent and deter violence in our schools. The Department of Justice is already directing funding to hire school resource officers, improving our background check systems, and prosecuting violent offenders at record levels. Today's report provides a substantive blueprint for this Administration's next steps to protect our young people. The Department of Justice will continue to support first responders and provide training for law enforcement officers and school personnel. I want to thank all of my fellow commissioners for their hard work on this report and thank the President for making our kids a priority."" U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar added, ""Improving Americans' mental health to help make our schools, communities, and families safer and healthier is an urgent challenge and a priority for the Trump Administration. We know that rates of mental illness continue to be of great concern, and the Commission's findings show an urgent need to identify youth at risk for mental illness and connect them with needed treatment and services. Making these connections to treatment within schools can be an important step toward improved mental health for our children and increased safety in our schools."" Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen M. Nielsen said, ""I am proud of the work of the Federal Commission on School Safety, which today offers a bold vision of secure and violence-free schools. This report provides actionable recommendations for communities, schools, and students to protect themselves and prevent acts of violence. The Department of Homeland Security is committed to the security of all Americans and will continue to work with our partners toward ending school violence."" COMMISSION BACKGROUND In the wake of the tragic shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in February, President Donald J. Trump established the Commission and tasked its members with studying and recommending ways to make our nation's schools more secure. Over the nine months that followed, the Commissioners, including U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker (who succeeded former Attorney General Jeff Sessions as a Commissioner), Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar, and Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen, held more than a dozen meetings, field visits, and listening sessions. Commission meetings provided a forum for presentations from subject matter experts, educators, law enforcement officials, and individuals affected by school violence. Field visits involved travel to schools to learn first-hand about current best practices in school safety. Listening sessions occurred in regions across the country and provided opportunities for the public to offer recommendations to the Commission. In total, the Commissioners heard from dozens of experts from nearly 40 states and reviewed more than 1,500 comments from the public via safety@ed.gov. REPORT OVERVIEW The Federal Commission on School Safety Report contains 19 chapters divided into three sections based on well-established phases of security planning: PREVENT Character Development and a Culture of Connectedness Cyberbullying and School Safety Curating a Healthier and Safer Approach: Issues of Mental Health and Counseling for Our Young Integrating Mental Health, Primary Care, Family Services, and Court-Ordered Treatment Using Suspicious Activity Reporting and Threat Assessments to Enhance School Safety Effects of Press Coverage of Mass Shootings Violent Entertainment and Rating Systems The Obama Administration's ""Rethink School Discipline"" Guidance The Effectiveness and Appropriateness of Psychotropic Medication for Treatment of Troubled Youth The Efficacy of Age Restrictions for Firearm Purchases Extreme Risk Protection Order Laws Improvements to the FBI's Public Access Line PROTECT & MITIGATE Training School Personnel to Help Ensure Student Safety Emergency and Crisis Training for Law Enforcement The Transition of Military Veterans and Retired Law Enforcement Officials into New Careers in Education Best Practices for School Building Security The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act and Other Statutory and Regulatory Privacy Protections The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Other Statutory and Regulatory Privacy Protections RESPOND & RECOVER Active Shooter Preparedness and Mitigation To view the report in its entirety, click here .

The Rethink CTE Summit expanded on the Department’s Rethink Education initiative and served as an implementation launch of the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act (Perkins V). Secretary DeVos and Assistant Secretary Stump encouraged those in attendance to take advantage of the new law and collaborate with state and local education agencies on ways to “rethink” CTE through the development of each state’s plan. “Too many students are unprepared for successful careers today, and beyond,” Secretary DeVos told the crowd. “And too many are treated more like commodities instead of as the individuals they are, each with unique abilities and aspirations. As innovators in education and business, you are in a position to help students get ready – for life and careers – with out-of-the-box learning opportunities. You are in a position to rethink education.” Assistant Secretary Stump said, “It is time for Career and Technical Education in the U.S. to be a nimble, demand-driven talent development system. To achieve this goal, we will need you as employers, educators, associations and philanthropic organizations, to engage and prepare your networks to be valuable contributors to each state’s Perkins V Plans.” Discussion topics for the all-day session included leveraging opportunities in Perkins V, putting policy into practice and expanding stakeholder engagement."

He'd tell you of his love for Bar, how proud he was of his children and how enamored he was by his grandchildren, because George H.W. Bush cared about people more than anything else. His dedication to others and his love for country are why he and his family worked so tirelessly to improve educational opportunities, especially expanding the power of literacy, for all. ""As we mourn, we take comfort in knowing that America now has a 1,001st point of light shining down from the Heavens on us.

In remarks she delivered at the annual Federal Student Aid (FSA) Training Conference in Atlanta, Secretary DeVos called America's higher education system ""the envy of the world"" but warned that if significant policy changes aren't made to the way student aid is distributed, administered and managed, ""the program on which so many students rely will be in serious jeopardy."" The Secretary then laid out four core principles from which decision makers can start when taking action to address the problem: "" First , people—human capital—are our greatest national resource. It's in our nation's interest to support individual students' interests, to support their potential, their creativity, their destiny. Every person should have the opportunity to pursue the education that's right for them. And so, supporting and encouraging a multitude of pathways makes common sense. "" Second , innovation must be unleashed. If it is, it will advance opportunity, efficiency, and results in education as it has in every other industry. "" Third , better, more accessible information is necessary for policymakers, for students, for parents, and for taxpayers. ""And finally , nothing is free. Someone, somewhere ultimately pays the bills."" Additional Speech Highlights The myStudentAid mobile app There were plenty of folks who declared it could not be done. They said the Department was ""overpromising what it could deliver."" That what was required was ""overwhelming"" ... the time frame was ""impractically"" ambitious. ... Today, the app makes it easier for students to complete their FAFSA. In the near future, a student will be able to see how much he or she owes at any moment in time, what repayment options are available, and how those options will impact the total amount owed over time. Financial literacy One major goal of the NextGen initiatives is to facilitate a partnership with you to improve student financial literacy. Imagine how students would benefit if they could easily and continually plan and budget for their education, if they could seamlessly access personalized insights about the outcomes of the program they are considering or in which they are enrolled. Think about the power of having hard numbers, and how having that information could help a student make more informed—and better—decisions. We are working to bring new tools like these online soon, so that in partnership with you, we can all fulfill our charge to help students earn their degrees and be positioned to succeed when they enter repayment. A crisis in higher education I'm here to raise a warning flag with American students and American taxpayers: We have a crisis in higher education. Our higher ed system is the envy of the world, but if we, as a country, do not make important policy changes in the way we distribute, administer, and manage federal student loans, the program on which so many students rely will be in serious jeopardy. ... Federal Student Aid was established to come alongside students who lack financial resources to pursue higher education. Since its first iteration in 1965, however, it has outgrown its structure and its governance. That reality has increasingly significant implications for American families and the American economy. ... It took 42 years—1965 until 2007—for the student loan balance to grow to $500 billion. It took only six years for the loan balance to double to $1 trillion in 2013—one-seventh the amount of time it took to get to $500 billion. And today, only five years later, FSA holds nearly $1.5 trillion in outstanding loans. ... Only 24 percent of FSA borrowers—one in four—are currently paying down both principal and interest. ... As for FSA's portfolio today, too many loans are either delinquent, in default, or are plans on which students are paying so little, their loan balance continues to grow.

They represent students and families ""in distress"" with very real implications for our economy and our future. ... Since 2010, when the previous administration orchestrated a government takeover of student lending, FSA's portfolio has skyrocketed. Over 8 percent annual growth. Two times faster than the growth of the cost of attendance and almost four times faster than the growth of our economy. Finding solutions Here are a few principles I think are important as we look to solutions. First , people—human capital—are our greatest national resource. It's in our nation's interest to support individual students' interests, to support their potential, their creativity, their destiny. Every person should have the opportunity to pursue the education that's right for them. And so, supporting and encouraging a multitude of pathways makes common sense. We shouldn't imply or decree that one, traditional pathway is the right thing for everyone. Second , innovation must be unleashed. If it is, it will advance opportunity, efficiency, and results in education as it has in every other industry. Third , better, more accessible information is necessary for policymakers, for students, for parents, and for taxpayers. And finally , nothing is free. Someone, somewhere ultimately pays the bills. ... Each of us has a contribution to make and a role to play in resolving our present crisis in higher education. FULL SPEECH (as prepared for delivery) Thank you, Jim, for that kind introduction and for your leadership at FSA. I'm pleased to be back at this conference with all of you who work so hard to educate, support, and serve students. The role you play in their lives is essential. You are there for them as they take steps on their lifelong learning journeys. They might not always say it, but I will: your impact on students is significant. So, let me take this opportunity to thank you. At last year's conference, I challenged Wayne Johnson and the team at FSA to rethink how we serve students. ""Rethink"" means everyone must question everything to ensure nothing limits students from being prepared for what comes next. When it comes to FSA, ""rethink"" means asking what we need to do to ensure that the services we deliver are on par with those of world-class financial firms and world-class customer experiences. The answer begins with modernizing our infrastructure and improving the way we connect with students through the full life of their higher education and through their student loan repayment. Repaying a student loan should not be complicated and it should not be frustrating. You can pay your car loan on your phone and manage your mortgage on an app. A student loan should be just as easy to handle! The first step of our ""NextGen"" modernization effort is the myStudentAid mobile app. We did what was alleged to be impossible: we made a government form look almost appealing! Seriously, we did more than make it look good. And there were plenty of folks who declared it could not be done. They said the Department was ""overpromising what it could deliver."" That what was required was ""overwhelming"" ... the time frame was ""impractically"" ambitious. Well... How many of you have it on your phone, too? As you know, the myStudentAid app launched exactly on schedule. And it's already making an impact. It has been downloaded nearly 250 thousand times and more than 375 thousand FAFSAs have been submitted on a mobile device! I've met with a number of students across the country, some of whom have given great feedback for tweaks and improvements, and others who've shared how happy they are to have this tool at their fingertips. I hope you've heard similar stories. Today the app makes it easier for students to complete their FAFSA. In the near future, a student will be able to see how much he or she owes at any moment in time, what repayment options are available, and how those options will impact the total amount owed over time. Overall, these NextGen initiatives are the most significant changes to Federal Student Aid... ever. And we're only getting started. Wayne will have more later on next steps for our platform development. But this morning, we need to discuss something even more important than ""NextGen"" initiatives. We need to have an honest conversation about student loans. I'm here to raise a warning flag with American students and American taxpayers: We have a crisis in higher education. Our higher ed system is the envy of the world, but if we, as a country, do not make important policy changes in the way we distribute, administer, and manage federal student loans, the program on which so many students rely will be in serious jeopardy. This crisis demands the attention of Congress, the American taxpayer, colleges and universities, parents, and students. In a word, everyone . Federal Student Aid was established to come alongside students who lack financial resources to pursue higher education. Since its first iteration in 1965, however, it has outgrown its structure and its governance. That reality has increasingly significant implications for American families and the American economy. It took 42 years—1965 until 2007—for the student loan balance to grow to 500 billion dollars. It took only six years for the loan balance to double—to one trillion dollars—in 2013. One-seventh the amount of time it took to get to 500 billion. And today , only five years later, FSA holds nearly 1.5 trillion dollars in outstanding loans. 1.5 trillion dollars is almost impossible to fathom. So, let me put it this way: 1.5 trillion dollars is more than 10 thousand dollars of someone else's student loan debt for each and every American taxpayer—145 million of them. At 1.5 trillion dollars, FSA's loan portfolio is now one-third of the Federal government's balance sheet. Last year, uncollateralized student loans—which are all of them, by the way—accounted for over 30 percent of all federal assets. One third of the balance sheet. Only through government accounting is this student loan portfolio counted as anything but an asset embedded with significant risk. In the commercial world, no bank regulator would allow this portfolio to be valued at full, face value. Federal Student Aid has a consumer loan portfolio larger than any private bank. Behemoths like Bank of America or J.P. Morgan pale in comparison. FSA also is the largest direct loan portfolio in the whole Federal government—by far—surpassing all other federal direct loans combined by 1.1 trillion dollars. And yet, only 24 percent of FSA borrowers—one in four—are currently paying down both principal and interest. Nearly 20 percent of all loans are delinquent or in default. That's seven times the rate of delinquency on credit card debt. And since 2010, the debt level of individual borrowers has ballooned. 70 percent of loan growth since then has been driven by increases in individual borrower debt load, only 30 percent is due to a growth in the number of borrowers. Nearly three quarters of accumulated debt represents the same students taking out more and more loans. This phenomenon is true for all types of higher ed institutions. And this trend line continues to grow. As for FSA's portfolio today, too many loans are either delinquent, in default, or are plans on which students are paying so little, their loan balance continues to grow. Ultimately, 43 percent of all loans are currently considered ""in distress."" These loans aren't just financial products. They represent students and families ""in distress"" with very real implications for our economy and our future. Take a look at this. Since 2010 when the previous administration orchestrated a government takeover of student lending, FSA's portfolio has skyrocketed. Over 8 percent annual growth. Two times faster than the growth of the cost of attendance and almost four times faster than the growth of our economy. Tuition, fees, room and board have grown at twice the rate of inflation and almost two and a half times median income. It has something to do with what one of my predecessors famously pointed out decades ago. When the federal government loans more taxpayer money, schools raise their rates. FSA financing accounts for 80 percent of the actual tuition and fee revenue received by schools. Today, FSA's portfolio is nearly 10 percent of our nation's debt. Stop and absorb that for a moment... ten percent of our total national debt. The student loan program is not only burying students in debt, it is also burying taxpayers and it's stealing from future generations. How did this happen? Well, as you know, in 2010 under the guise of helping expand the Pell grant program and paying for ObamaCare, the previous administration federalized the student loan portfolio. That move was paired with a consistent drumbeat of not-so-subtle signals that a traditional 4-year college degree is the only path to and measure for success. And lots of people believed that centrally-planning everything in Washington would make higher education more accessible for students, and more lucrative for the federal government. But the opposite is happening. The parade of programs, repayment options, and complex rules serves no one well. Everything has become more cumbersome and confusing for everyone . The government monopoly has proven costly to taxpayers and it hasn't been a panacea for students either. We know students are having poor experiences. With more than 30 variations of 10 different repayment plans, each with their own set of burdensome requirements, it's no wonder this government maze doesn't work. Students are taking out tens of thousands of dollars in debt but many are misinformed or uninformed as to the implications of taking on that debt and their responsibilities to pay it back. Consider the current language of loans. We give students ""award letters,"" which suggest they are gifts. We all know, however, they are ""debt letters."" And we call the loan ""aid,"" as though it's a grant that doesn't need to be paid back. Then there's the matter of communication. FSA communicates with students essentially twice: the first time when they take out the loan, and the second time when the loan comes due. FSA has not focused on helping students fully understand their responsibilities. Instead, FSA applauds itself on getting more taxpayer money out the door in a one-size-fits-all approach. We are changing that. We all share the goal of helping students succeed—in learning and in life. One major goal of the NextGen initiatives is to facilitate a partnership with you to improve student financial literacy. Imagine how students would benefit if they could easily and continually plan and budget for their education, if they could seamlessly access personalized insights about the outcomes of the program they are considering or in which they are enrolled. Think about the power of having hard numbers, and how having that information could help a student make more informed—and better—decisions. We are working to bring new tools like these online soon, so that in partnership with you, we can all fulfill our charge to help students earn their degree and be positioned to succeed when they enter repayment. Because this higher education crisis is borne out in more than just numbers. Behind all the slides and statistics I've shown are the faces of students who can barely peer over their mountain of debt. Behind the debt are dashed hopes, delayed adulthoods, and struggling families. One recent study found ""Millennials with student loan debt tend to have larger mortgages on lower-value homes."" Home ownership was once—and still is—an essential part of the American Dream. But a recent Pew survey pointed out that over 32 percent of Millennials are still living with mom and dad. That's the highest it's been since 1940. And for today's indebted adult learners who are the mom or dad, where do they go? We just cannot continue to perpetuate a system that has such dire results. Policies should never entice students into greater debt. Nor should they put taxpayer dollars at greater risk. Today, we are doing both. Now, there are too many who want to play the ""blame game"" or to demagogue this topic. Instead, we have to get serious about fixing it. We all have a role to play. Here are a few principles I think are important as we look to solutions. First, people—human capital—are our greatest national resource. It's in our nation's interest to support individual students' interests, to support their potential, their creativity, their destiny. Every person should have the opportunity to pursue the education that's right for them. And so, supporting and encouraging a multitude of pathways makes common sense. We shouldn't imply or decree that one, traditional pathway is the right thing for everyone. Second, innovation must be unleashed. If it is, it will advance opportunity, efficiency, and results in education as it has in every other industry. Third, better, more accessible information is necessary for policymakers, for students, for parents, and for taxpayers. And finally, nothing is free. Someone, somewhere ultimately pays the bills. As Secretary, I can move on a few, small tactical measures. And we are working daily to improve every part of FSA's operations and I'm committed to doing everything I can to solve this crisis. I know you also work daily to do your best for every student who walks through your door. But, ultimately, no one person or group can make a dent on this higher ed crisis without an honest conversation about real solutions. There's a fitting metaphor that comes to mind. When a thunderstorm looms on the horizon, pilots have a couple of choices to make. They can either adjust their flight path ten degrees when they are a long distance away from the storm. Or they can stay on their original course and then be forced to make a jarring and abrupt turn when they fly right up to the bad weather. We face that same decision here. The federal government must become a more responsible lender. Congress must recognize and be honest about the unmistakable implications of its favored programs on students, on taxpayers, and on rising costs. Schools must become honest about their individual roles in the cost-value proposition. Every school should focus on helping each student find the right pathway. And they should help students graduate with high-quality career prospects and with low debt. Students—our human capital—must equip themselves to be responsible consumers of education with a serious commitment to their own success. They need to have the best possible tools, data, advice, and support. And then they need to understand the implications of their decisions. Each of us has a contribution to make and a role to play in resolving our present crisis in higher education. I'm confident we can—and we will—rise to this challenge. Because Americans have never shied away from challenges. We live in some of the most exciting and opportunity-filled times ever. Let's ensure our rising generations can seize each and every opportunity, and that the only thing that limits them... is their imagination. Thank you and may God bless our nation and her students.

Marcus. “Since joining the OCR team in June, I’ve reviewed our Case Processing Manual and received important and constructive feedback on it. While we continue to work to improve the timeliness of OCR’s case processing, we have determined that additional revisions will help improve our work and allow us to be more responsive to students, stakeholders and our staff.” The CPM provides guidelines for field investigators working to investigate and resolve complaints and to ensure schools comply with the laws and regulations enforced by OCR. The CPM underwent its last revision in March of 2018. Key revisions to the CPM include the following: Requires OCR to comport with the First Amendment when investigating and resolving complaints. Restores appeals for complainants, who can appeal findings of insufficient evidence, as well as certain types of dismissals, and provides recipients with the opportunity to respond to appeals. Eliminates section 108(t) from the earlier CPM, which had provided that OCR would dismiss a complaint that is part of a pattern of complaints that places an unreasonable burden on OCR’s resources. As an important complement to the CPM revisions, OCR is implementing post-case closure Quality Assurance Reviews to assure consistency and quality in case processing among the 12 regional OCR offices. OCR will also use the reviews to identify areas where further training is necessary, and to identify and share best practices among the regional offices. The CPM retains several important changes from its March 2018 revision: Investigation and resolution activities focus on the individual allegation(s) stated by the complainant. OCR will also undertake systemic investigations only where it is appropriate to do so in light of the allegations or based on facts ascertained in the investigation. Increased opportunities for the resolution of complaints through the Rapid Resolution Process (RRP) and the Facilitated Resolution Between the Parties (FRBP) process. These processes permit the parties to resolve a complaint themselves with OCR’s facilitation. Expanded timeframes for the negotiation of resolution agreements with recipients.

The proposed regulation under Title IX, the federal civil rights law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs or activities that receive federal funding, was developed after more than a year of research, deliberation, and gathering input from students, advocates, school administrators, Title IX coordinators, and other stakeholders. ""Throughout this process, my focus was, is, and always will be on ensuring that every student can learn in a safe and nurturing environment,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. ""That starts with having clear policies and fair processes that every student can rely on. Every survivor of sexual violence must be taken seriously, and every student accused of sexual misconduct must know that guilt is not predetermined. We can, and must, condemn sexual violence and punish those who perpetrate it, while ensuring a fair grievance process. Those are not mutually exclusive ideas. They are the very essence of how Americans understand justice to function."" The Department's proposed rule takes the important and historic step of defining sexual harassment under Title IX and what it means for a student to report it, requires schools to respond meaningfully to every report of sexual harassment, and ensures that due process protections are in place for all students. The Department's proposed rule seeks to ensure that all schools clearly understand their legal obligations under Title IX and that all students clearly understand their options and rights. Key provisions The proposed rule would require schools to respond meaningfully to every known report of sexual harassment and to investigate every formal complaint. The proposed rule highlights the importance of supportive measures designed to preserve or restore a student's access to the school's education program or activity, with or without a formal complaint. Supportive measures may include the following: Academic course adjustments Counseling No-contact orders Dorm room reassignments Leaves of absence Class schedule changes Where there has been a finding of responsibility, the proposed rule would require remedies for the survivor to restore or preserve access to the school's education program or activity. The proposed rule would require schools to apply basic due process protections for students, including a presumption of innocence throughout the grievance process; written notice of allegations and an equal opportunity to review all evidence collected; and the right to cross- examination, subject to ""rape shield"" protections. Colleges and universities would be required to hold a live hearing where cross-examination would be conducted through the parties' advisors. Personal confrontation between the complainant and respondent would not be permitted. To promote impartial decisions, schools would not be allowed to use a ""single investigator"" or ""investigator-only"" model. Under the proposed rule, if a school chooses to offer an appeal, both parties can appeal. Consistent with U.S. Supreme Court Title IX cases, the proposed rule defines sexual harassment as unwelcome conduct on the basis of sex that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to the school's education program or activity. The proposed rule adopts the Clery Act definition of sexual assault and includes it in the definition of sexual harassment under Title IX. ""It is our goal with this proposed rule to ensure that Title IX grievance proceedings become more transparent, consistent, and reliable in their processes and outcomes,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""Far too many students have been forced to go to court to ensure their rights are protected because the Department has not set out legally binding rules that hold schools accountable for responding to allegations of sexual harassment in a supportive, fair manner. By following proper legal procedures and receiving input on our proposed rule, we will ultimately have a final regulation that ensures that Title IX protects all students."" The Department's proposed Title IX rule will be open for public comment for 60 days from the date of publication in the Federal Register.

For the first time, students and parents can access the FAFSA on their cell phone and tablets, thanks to the newly launched myStudentAid app. While this is a major first step in our efforts to transform FSA, there is still much work to be done to simplify the FAFSA® and make the student loan repayment process more streamlined and easier to navigate. I look forward to working with Chairman Alexander and Congress on these important reforms.” Secretary DeVos meets with students at Sevier County High School Every year, 20 million students complete the FAFSA. In October, the U.S. Department of Education launched a new mobile app to make it simpler and easier to apply for and, in the future, pay back federal student loans using a smartphone or tablet. To date, more than 209,000 people have downloaded the mobile app and more than 2.9 million have completed the 2019-20 FAFSA. Approximately 10 percent of the FAFSA submissions have come through the mobile app, opening access to more students, especially those who lack regular access to a computer. “We have apps on our phones that allow us to do anything from booking an airplane ticket to placing an Amazon order, so while it may seem very ordinary to fill out the FAFSA on an app, this is the first year it's possible,” Sen. Alexander said. “Last year, about 775 high school students in Sevier County filled out the FAFSA – along with another 400,000 Tennesseans – but many others did not fill it out. I am glad Secretary DeVos is taking steps to make it easier for students to apply for federal and state financial aid, including Pell Grants, Tennessee Promise, and the Tennessee Hope Scholarship.” Senator Alexander demonstrating the length of the FAFSA paper form"

In total, the Department obligated $279 million in STEM discretionary grant funds in Fiscal Year 2018. ""It's important that all students have access to a high-quality STEM education,"" U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos said. ""These discretionary grant programs and this Administration's increased focus on STEM will help ensure our nation's students are exposed to STEM early in their lifelong education journeys and will have the tools needed for success in the 21 st century economy."" The Department's efforts to support STEM education, through the Secretary's STEM discretionary grant priority, include funding for: Education Innovation and Research (EIR) — $66.8 million Supporting Effective Educator Development (SEED) —$28.2 million Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) —$16.4 million Pathways to Apprenticeship for High School Career and Technical Education (CTE) Students —$3.6 million Innovative approaches to literacy (IAL) —$26.7 Indian Education Discretionary Grants Programs: Professional Development Grants Program —$6.2 million Training Program for Federal TRIO Programs —$1.2 million GEAR UP Competition: New Partnership Awards —$108 million GEAR UP Competition: New State Awards —$20.4 million Center on Early STEM Learning for Young Children with Disabilities 1.45 million While these investments mark a significant step toward advancing STEM education in the United States, there is still more work to be done. According to the Department's newly released data story on STEM, 80 percent of all eighth-graders attend a school that offers Algebra 1, but only 24 percent of these students are actually enrolled in the course. As many have acknowledged, this ""leak"" in the STEM pipeline can have long-term effects on students' education, since Algebra 1 is considered the gatekeeper course to advanced math and science courses. According to the primary data source, the 2015-16 Civil Rights Data Collection , students' access to algebra in eighth grade is inconsistent across the country and access to STEM education can be impacted by a number of factors, such as the location of the school or the type of school a student attends. Students enrolled in magnet or traditional public schools were more likely to have access to Algebra 1 than at other types of schools. Similarly students attending suburban schools were more likely to have access than students in other areas. Enrollment is just as important as access, but data show not all students with access were enrolled at the same rate. Asian students were more likely to be enrolled in Algebra 1 in eighth grade—34 percent—compared with only 12 percent of eighth grade black students. In addition, a slightly higher percentage of female students (25 percent) compared with male students (22 percent) were enrolled in Algebra 1 in eighth grade. This Administration knows that a strong STEM education is a pathway to successful careers, and that's why it is committed to ensuring equal access to a strong STEM education for all students."

ESSA directs states and districts to publish report cards that show important measures of state, district and school performance, and progress. Specifically, states and districts will report on graduation rates, student achievement, school climate, state accountability, teacher qualifications and other key indicators. For the first time ever, states will be required to report funding from federal, state and local sources, and how much money is spent per pupil. Parents will be able to utilize this valuable information to make informed decisions about their child’s current education, as well as future learning pathways. “Parents deserve to know what is happening in their child’s school,” said Secretary DeVos. “They should not have to parse through a 500-page legal document to understand how a law or policy affects their children’s education. This guide demonstrates our ongoing commitment to providing parents with user-friendly tools and the information necessary to make informed decisions. Informed parents become empowered and engaged parents who are able to better advocate on behalf of their children.” For more information on ESSA report cards, please see the parent guide that is available here . ESSA requires that report cards be concise, understandable and accessible to the public. Later this week, the Department’s Office of Educational Technology is hosting a Report Card Design Challenge.

The focus of the discussion was on professional development, retention and teacher recognition. The Secretary heard from several teachers who talked about the importance of access to meaningful professional development that can improve teacher performance and student outcomes, the need to be fairly compensated for their work and expertise and the desire to be recognized as professionals who can provide valuable input at the school, local, state and federal levels. “I’m grateful for the opportunity to have met with this outstanding group of teacher leaders,” said Secretary DeVos. “For too long, in too many schools, teachers have been given a binary choice—stay in the classroom or become an administrator. Teachers need access to additional pathways for growth, improvement and recognition. I look forward to continuing this important conversation as we work to find ways to elevate and improve the teaching profession and ensure teachers are valued as the professionals they are.” Yesterday’s teacher roundtable was one of several the Secretary has hosted over the last few months with teachers from across the country."

Beverly Perdue Appointed Chair of the National Assessment Governing Board,"WASHINGTON—Former North Carolina Gov. Beverly Perdue has been appointed to serve as chair of the National Assessment Governing Board , U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos announced today. Perdue will be the first female chair in the 30-year history of the board, which she joined as a member in October 2017. During her time on the board, she has served on the committee on standards, design and methodology. Perdue, who served as North Carolina's first female governor from 2009 to 2013, will lead the 26-member nonpartisan, independent governing board that sets policy for the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). Known as ""the Nation's Report Card,"" NAEP provides the public and national, state and local education policymakers with objective data on student performance in nearly a dozen subjects. The relevant information that NAEP provides about U.S. student achievement helps education stakeholders evaluate the progress of American education. The board determines the subjects and content of NAEP tests, sets the achievement levels for reporting and publicly releases the results. ""I am delighted to welcome former North Carolina Gov. Beverly Perdue as the chair of the National Assessment Governing Board,"" Secretary DeVos said. ""Her years of experience and time spent in the classroom as a public school teacher will be vital to the work of the board as it continues its efforts to strengthen and advance education opportunities for students across our country."" During her early career, Perdue was a public school teacher. Her political career began in 1986 when she was elected to the North Carolina House of Representatives for two terms. During 25 years of public service, she also represented North Carolina as a state senator, lieutenant governor and governor. While in the State Senate, she led the Education and Appropriations Committee. Since she left office, Perdue has continued to support teachers and has initiated many education efforts, including founding and chairing digiLEARN, a non-profit institution designed to accelerate personal learning options for students and instructional opportunities for teachers. digiLEARN focuses on using technology to create data-based learning and assessments for students, along with professional development opportunities for teachers that allow them to lead from their classrooms. Perdue also has served as a Resident Fellow at the Harvard Institute of Politics and a Distinguished Visiting Fellow at Duke University's Sanford School of Public Policy. She also consults on a number of national and state education issues. ""I am honored to be chosen for this position, and I look forward to working with my colleagues on the board to close our nation's achievement gap and ensure that all students, regardless of geography or circumstance, have access to a great education that prepares them for the jobs of tomorrow,"" Perdue said. NAEP is a congressionally authorized project sponsored by the U.S. Department of Education. The National Center for Education Statistics , within the Institute of Education Sciences, administers NAEP. The commissioner of education statistics is responsible by law for carrying out the NAEP project."

The study provides the first national look at how districts and educators use educational technology to instruct English learner students—the fastest-growing student population in the country. Today’s students are entering classrooms that have seen rapid adoption of digital technologies in instruction. With these new technologies, teachers of English learner (EL) students, whether they are general education teachers or specialists in EL student instruction, have exciting new tools to support learning. This toolkit brings suggestions and resources for educators who want to utilize new technology-based resources to help their EL students gain proficiency in English and meet academic goals. The toolkit offers five guiding principles for educators to apply in exploring new ways of working with and supporting EL students through technology. In addition, the toolkit has a companion—The Developer Toolkit which provides guidance for developers on the needs of English learner students and their teachers, tips on supports to include with their products that may be especially useful for English learners and ways they can communicate about their products with districts and educators of English learner students to facilitate adoption. “This toolkit provides important resources for educators and educational technology developers alike who are eager to serve the unique needs of our nation’s EL students,” said Jose A. Viana, assistant deputy secretary and director of the Office of English Language Acquisition, which commissioned the study. “And since many districts now require that supports for English learner students be available in any educational technology they purchase, this study and the information it provides is very timely.”"

The ""Dear Parent"" letter, written in plain language, was released at a roundtable with parents, students and educators in Mississippi as part of the Secretary's ""Rethink School"" tour. The guide is available here . ""At the core of ESSA is an acknowledgment that Washington doesn't know best when it comes to educating our nation's students,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""Our focus is on returning power to the hands of parents, states and local educators, where it belongs. Parents should not have to parse through a 500-page legal document to understand how a law or policy affects their children's education."" DeVos continued, ""Because states and districts have significant flexibility in how they meet the requirements of the law, parents should know and have a voice in how they use that flexibility to best help their children. These new resources will help empower those closest to students with information they need to be informed advocates as education decisions are made at the state and local level."" ESSA marked a seminal step taken by Congress to devolve power over education out of Washington and return it into the hands of states and local educators. The flexibilities included in ESSA are wide-ranging, including: allowing states the opportunity to implement innovative tests, not just a statewide test; broad discretion for states to design accountability systems to hold schools accountable for student achievement; a public school choice option for students in schools identified for comprehensive improvement; the ability to use federal funds to provide ""direct student services"" that it otherwise couldn't, such as enabling students to enroll in different courses; and the opportunity to combine funds to better support students. The guide includes a 19-slide presentation that highlights the different ways states and districts can meet the letter of the law. Along with the guide, a summary document highlights the options that ESSA provides to states and school districts, and a more technical document explains how ESSA's flexibility can affect the way that states, districts and schools meet the law's requirements for academic standards, testing and more. You can find these materials, along with all the other ESSA resources, here: https://www2.ed.gov/policy/elsec/leg/essa/index.html . Supportive Statements for the Parents' Guide to ESSA Flexibilities Governor Matt Bevin of Kentucky: ""We are grateful to Secretary DeVos and the U.S. Department of Education for issuing this Parent Guide regarding important flexibilities provided by the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA). State and local input is a vital component to ensuring student success, and this thoughtful effort will help empower parents, educators and communities to be engaged advocates in the education of each individual child."" Commissioner Michael Johnson of the Alaska Department of Education: ""The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) has created greater flexibility by allowing states to create systems that are tailored to their unique needs. ESSA outlines a variety of ways to measure student achievement; states have the opportunity to create an accountability system that is more meaningful for a local context; and permitting the braiding and blending of federal, state and local funds to maximize impact. Building on this flexibility, additional creativity is needed by all stakeholders to make sure we are meeting the needs of all students."" Commissioner Wayne Lewis of the Kentucky Department of Education: ""A major welcoming shift in the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) is the focus on meaningful parent and family engagement. Kentucky embraces finding new ways for parents to engage in their child's education and become part of the decision making process at their school and at the state level. Such engagement can be intimidating to parents. That is why the package of parent- and community-friendly documents the U.S. Department of Education has created are so important. They cut through the jargon that is often found in education to give parents and community members a quick understanding of what the law requires, and what steps they can take to help improve student achievement at their schools."" Superintendent Elsie Arntzen of the Montana Office of Public Instruction: ""Montana is working continuously on transparency on all of our communications to parents, education stakeholders and communities across our state. These documents are part of putting believability back into government serving students."" Commissioner Frank Edelblut of the New Hampshire Department of Education: ""Children thrive when families play an active role in their education. Informed parents are better equipped to fill that role. So, we appreciate this supportive resource from the U.S. Department of Education that helps our parents, educators and communities better understand the federal education laws affecting their children."" Secretary-Designate Chris Ruszkowski of the New Mexico Department of Public Education: ""New Mexico has harnessed the power of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) over the past three years by continuing to raise the bar for every student, and by providing the right balance of accountability and autonomy for every school statewide. This Parent Guide will help us stay the course and with continuous improvement, there is no limit to what we can achieve."" Superintendent Jillian Balow of the Wyoming Department of Education: ""In Wyoming, our students do better when everyone comes to the table and contributes - parents, teachers, administrators, legislators and of course our partners at the U.S. Department of Education. We believe that the more information there is to share, the better prepared our students will be to enter college, a career or the military. This new, easy to understand packet of information from the U.S. Department of Education is exactly what we've been waiting for to engage parents and students."""

Under the Open Textbooks Pilot Program , funded by Congress in the FY 2018 omnibus spending bill, UC Davis will head a consortium of 12 campuses that will begin by creating open textbooks focused on high-enrollment courses like chemistry, as well as career-technical education (CTE) fields. Technical textbooks are among the more expensive books that students must purchase, as they often must be updated frequently to keep pace with changing technologies. “The cost of college textbooks has almost doubled in the past 10 years,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. “This program is an important step toward reducing barriers, expanding access and increasing choice for students who want to attend college or learn a trade. I commend Senators Durbin, King, and Smith, as well as Representatives Polis and Sinema for theircommitment to getting this pilot program passed through Congress, and I look forward to working together to make textbooks more easily accessible for students, professors and the public.” According to the program’s July 30 Federal Register notice , the cost of college textbooks jumped 88 percent between 2006 and 2016. In the 2016-17 academic year, the average college student budget for books and supplies had risen to $1,263 for students at four-year institutions and $1,458 at two–year schools. Open textbooks are defined as textbooks that reside in the public domain or have been released under a license that permits their free use, reuse, modification and sharing with others. UC Davis plans to launch its efforts by expanding the existing LibreTexts open textbook service. LibreTexts is a multi-institution venture aimed at developing the next generation of open-access texts to improve postsecondary education at all levels of higher learning. “Our effort will build on the best practices that we established over the past decade in the development of the LibreTexts,” UC Davis said in its application. “These are the same efforts that make LibreTexts the largest, highest-ranked and most-visited open educational resource (OER). To this end, we propose to expand the LibreTexts into an expansive living library of content that can be customized to faculty needs.” The high-enrollment field of chemistry will be a priority in the expansion of the LibreText library where open textbooks will be developed “to enable a zero textbook cost (ZTC) option for an American Chemical Society, ACS-certified curriculum for a bachelor’s degree,” according to the grant application. In addition, a new “trade” library will be dedicated to career and technical education fields. Besides UC Davis, the consortium with access to the pilot program text will include: the University of Arkansas, Little Rock (AR), Saint Mary's College (IN), Prince George Community College (MD), Hope College (MI), American River College (CA), Contra Costa College (CA), Cosumnes River College (CA), Diablo Valley College (CA), Folsom Lake College (CA), Los Medanos College (CA) and Sacramento City College (CA). The California State University system is also a partner."

This year, the Secretary will visit Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana. During the past month, senior department leaders, including Deputy Secretary Mick Zais, Acting Under Secretary Diane Auer Jones, Assistant Secretary for Elementary and Secondary Education Frank Brogan, and Assistant Secretary for Career, Technical and Adult Education Scott Stump, visited 42 states, as well as D.C., Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands as part of the Department’s back-to-school tour. “Our team is crossing the country this year to challenge local leaders, educators and parents to rethink school,” said Secretary DeVos. “We know the current system is leaving too many students unprepared, so we must question everything about the way we do school in this country. There’s no more time for tinkering around the edges. No more trying the same things and expecting different results. I’m excited to highlight pockets of innovation around the country that are truly challenging the status quo and working to ensure all children can have access to the education that fits their learning style and prepares them for a successful future.” The Rethink School Tour challenges everyone, everywhere to question everything to ensure nothing limits students from being prepared for what comes next in their education, careers and in life. The Secretary and department officials will continue to highlight schools and visit with teachers, students, parents and local leaders who are unafraid to question the standard operating procedures that arbitrarily limit students from reaching their fullest potential. The questions raised and discussed on the tour include: Why limit educators? Why assign kids to schools based on their addresses? Why group kids by age? Why force all students to learn at the same speed? Why measure education by hours and days? Why suggest a college degree is the only path to success? Why believe learning stops at graduation? Most stops on the tour are open press with the opportunity for several interviews with Secretary DeVos. Additional details on stops in each state will be forthcoming over the next few days."

Additionally, more than $800,000 was provided for similar relief to students in South Carolina, totaling more than $2.8 million for the two states. “Our hearts go out to the thousands of students in North Carolina whose lives were impacted by Hurricane Florence,” said Secretary DeVos. “The Department will continue to do all that it can to assist students, faculty and institutions in the Carolinas as they work to recover from this disaster.” The money is being made available through the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) program. Each year, the Department awards supplemental funding for the program from amounts returned unused by other institutions participating in FSEOG. This year’s supplemental funds are being targeted at 38 institutions located in counties in North and South Carolina designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency for individual or public assistance as a result of Hurricane Florence.

The PACE will use local assessments as part of the annual determination of student proficiency for accountability. The assessments will be informed by local teachers, integrated into students’ day-to-day work and reduce the overall amount of standardized testing. Louisiana was the first state to receive approval to utilize this flexibility. Its pilot program will measure student understanding in English language arts (ELA) and social studies by assessing students on passages from books used in daily classroom instruction at regular intervals, rather than randomly-selected texts once during the school year. The Innovative Assessment Demonstration Authority (IADA) program is designed to lower barriers to innovation and encourage local involvement in the development of the next generation of assessments. As part of the program, states can pilot new and innovative assessments on a small scale, avoid double-testing students on both pilot and statewide exams and develop strategies for implementing such innovative assessments statewide over time. To participate in the pilot, states must apply and demonstrate how their innovative assessments are developed in collaboration with local stakeholders, aligned to challenging state academic standards and accessible to all students through use of principles of universal design for learning, among other requirements."

The myStudentAid app will allow students and parents to easily and securely complete the 2019 – 20 Free Application for Federal Student Aid ( FAFSA® ) using the app's myFAFSA component. ""The future of the FAFSA is here,"" said Education Secretary Betsy DeVos."" ""Now, students and their families have federal student aid tools in the palm of their hand, which will help them achieve their higher education goals, learn more about the schools to which they are applying, and gain greater access to important information about their financial future. Many said this wasn't possible, but we refuse to let anything limit us from doing what's best for students."" The mobile app is available for iOS and Android devices and allows students and parents to begin, complete, and submit a new or renewal FAFSA for the 2019–20 FAFSA processing cycle. Through a customized experience based on their role—student, parent, or preparer—app users receive guidance on how to complete the FAFSA, making the overall process more positive, engaging, and user-friendly. The first application was received from New York at 1:06 a.m., six minutes into the new processing year. The app provides several useful and time-saving features. Students can use the app's myCollegeScorecard feature to easily view and compare additional information about the schools they selected on their FAFSA. Eligible students and parents may use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool (IRS DRT) to electronically transfer federal tax return information into their FAFSA form. Plus, eligible students and families in certain states can transfer their FAFSA information into their state aid application. Participating states include Iowa, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Vermont. In addition to being able to fill out the FAFSA, the myStudentAid mobile app will help students and parents manage their username and password (FSA ID) through the Profile feature; view federal student aid history using the myFederalLoans option; get in touch with Federal Student Aid contact centers to have questions answered; and access StudentAid.gov , Federal Student Aid's key source of information about the federal student aid programs, application process, and loan repayment options. The mobile app also provides the same data protections as filling out the FAFSA on fafsa.gov. In an effort to provide a more mobile-friendly user experience, the fafsa.gov site was refreshed this summer with a new look and feel and also was redesigned so that pages fit the screen size and shape of any device, including desktop or laptop computers and smartphones and tablets. The app is the first public-facing step in the implementation of the Next Generation Financial Services Environment (NextGen), which will create an improved, world-class customer experience for FSA's millions of customers, while creating a more agile, flexible operating model that will streamline FSA's operations.

This year's Governing Board appointees include four new members and one re-appointed member—the Board's current Vice Chair Tonya Matthews. The appointees' terms begin on Oct. 1, 2018, and end on Sept. 30, 2022. The appointees will help set policy for the N ational Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) , also known as the Nation's Report Card. NAEP offers to the public and to education policymakers at the national, state and local levels, objective data on student performance in nearly a dozen subjects. The information NAEP provides helps education stakeholders evaluate the progress of American education. The 26-member nonpartisan, independent Governing Board determines the subjects and content of NAEP tests, sets the achievement levels for reporting and publicly releases the results. ""I'm pleased to welcome this diverse group of leaders from across the country to the National Assessment Governing Board,"" Secretary DeVos said. ""The board plays an important role in assessing student achievement, and I am confident that their collective experience will be a valuable asset as we work to ensure that all students have equal access to a great education that gives them the opportunity to reach their fullest potential."" The appointees and the roles they represent on the Board are listed below: Paul Gasparini, Secondary School Principal: Gasparini is the principal of Jamesville-DeWitt High School in Dewitt, New York, a position he has held for 17 years. Gasparini chairs the Central New York High School Principals Consortium, and his accolades include being named state high school principal of the year by the School Administrators Association of New York state. Julia Keleher, Chief State School Officer: Keleher was appointed as Puerto Rico's secretary of education in December 2016. She has more than 20 years of experience in education at the federal, state, district and school levels. Keleher is also an adjunct professor at The George Washington University, where she teaches graduate-level courses in the Business School and the Graduate School of Education and Human Development. Tonya Matthews, General Public Representative: Matthews joined the Governing Board in 2014. She is the founder of The STEMinista Project—an initiative to engage girls' interest in science and technology careers. Mostly recently, Matthews served as president and chief executive officer of the Michigan Science Center, a science museum for children and young adults in Detroit. Mark Miller, Eighth-Grade Teacher: Miller is a mathematics teacher and chair of the mathematics department at Cheyenne Mountain Junior High School in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Miller has more than 20 years of experience teaching mathematics at the junior-high level. Miller is a National Board Certified Teacher and serves on a standard-setting panel for the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards. His accolades include being nominated for the Presidential Award for Excellence in Mathematics and Science. Nardi Routten, Fourth-Grade Teacher: Routten is a fourth-grade teacher at Chester A. Moore Elementary in Fort Pierce, Florida. She has taught third- and fourth-graders in St. Lucie County for more than 20 years. Routten, a National Board Certified Teacher, has received local and national recognition for her excellence in teaching, including the Milken Educator Award in 2014. ""We are excited to have such a breadth of talent and expertise join the Board and contribute to a group of leaders who are dedicated to maintaining NAEP's rigor and quality, while making the assessment useful and relevant for the public,"" said Lisa Stooksberry, deputy executive director for the Governing Board. Every year, the Governing Board conducts a nationwide search for Board nominees. After the nominations period ends, the Governing Board narrows the pool of nominees to a list of finalists from which the U.S. Secretary of Education selects Board members. The Governing Board is now accepting nominations for Board members whose terms will begin Oct. 1, 2019. To learn more about the open Board positions and the nomination process, visit http://bit.ly/JoinTheBoard11 . Nominations are due by 5 p.m. EST on Oct. 31, 2018. The National Assessment Governing Board is an independent, nonpartisan board whose members include governors, state legislators, local and state school officials, educators, business representatives and members of the general public. Congress created the 26-member Governing Board in 1988 to set policy for the National Assessment of Educational Progress. For more information about the Governing Board, visit www.nagb.org ."

""Florida's plan meets the requirements of the law, so I am pleased to approve it,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""Today marks a significant milestone in the implementation of this important law. As we move into the next phase, we look forward to working with states as they bring their plans on paper to life and use the flexibilities afforded in ESSA to innovate and improve educational opportunities for all students. ""As I said several months ago, we don't evaluate football teams solely on who has the better game plan on paper,"" Secretary DeVos continues. ""We evaluate them by what happens on the field. We are eager to see how local leaders work to improve education 'on the field' across the country."" Allowing states more flexibility in how they deliver education to students is at the core of ESSA. Each state crafted a plan that it feels will best offer educational opportunities to meet the needs of the state and its students. The opportunities provided by ESSA for state and local innovation go beyond the approval of state plans. The Department has been and will continue to work with states, Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico, as well as school districts, to improve implementation of the law and to encourage expanded use of evidence-based interventions and practices. This work will help ensure that all students, particularly educationally disadvantaged students, meet challenging state academic standards and graduate from high school ready for whatever comes next in their lifelong learning journey. The Department has a variety of mechanisms, such as technical assistance and monitoring, to support states and school districts in addressing needs unique to their contexts and students, and ensuring they are meeting ESSA's requirements. ESSA's guardrails are essential to ensuring that every child, including our most vulnerable students, has the opportunity to succeed. The following are some of the unique elements from Florida's approved plan as highlighted by the state: Preserves the focus on improving outcomes for all students, including progress, achievement, acceleration and graduation, by maintaining high standards and the state's transparent accountability system Builds on the state's success by continued monitoring of school progress, specific feedback and guidance, and oversight in districts where schools perform poorly Supports the hard work of teachers and students by providing more detailed information about our schools, including progress of our English Learners, that can help families make informed decisions about their students' education and school improvement. ""We are thrilled that Florida's ESSA plan will ensure we remain on the positive trajectory for which we have become known,"" said Florida Education Commissioner Pam Stewart. ""The 2017 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) results showed that Florida's students excelled while much of the nation remained flat, and, just this month, Education Week ranked Florida 4th in the nation for K-12 student achievement. These and Florida's many other education accomplishments are the result of hard work in our schools, high expectations for every student and a strong accountability system. With this plan, Florida will continue these student-centered policies, which will keep our students on track for even greater success."""
26-Sep-18,https://web.archive.org/web/20210108025343/https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/national-student-loan-cohort-default-rate-falls,National Student Loan Cohort Default Rate Falls,"The U.S. Department of Education (Department) today announced that the Fiscal Year (FY) 2015 national federal student loan cohort default rate (also referred to as the CDR) decreased by 6.1 percent compared to the FY 2014 national rate, from 11.5 percent to 10.8 percent. The FY 2015 CDR represents the lowest national cohort default rate since the three-year rate was first released in 2012. The FY 2015 national cohort default rate is the percentage of a school's borrowers who entered repayment on Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program or William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan (Direct Loan) Program loans between Oct. 1, 2014 and Sept. 30, 2015, and subsequently defaulted prior to Sept. 30, 2017. During the tracking period for the FY 2015 borrower cohort—from Oct. 1, 2014 to Sept. 30, 2017—more than 4.9 million borrowers entered repayment, and 531,653 of them, or 10.8 percent, defaulted on their loans. Those borrowers attended 6,155 postsecondary institutions across the nation. Rate Trends From FY 2014 to FY 2015, cohort default rates fell for public and private institutions, while rising slightly among borrowers who attended proprietary schools. For public institutions, the FY 2015 rate, 10.3 percent, fell from 11.3 percent in FY 2014. Public institutions make up approximately 27 percent—or 1,660—of the total number of schools and represent approximately 53 percent of borrowers who entered repayment that year. The rate dropped among private schools from 7.4 percent in FY 2014 to 7.1 percent in FY 2015. Private schools comprise approximately 28 percent—or 1,726—of the total number of schools. Among the 2,364 proprietary institutions in the borrower cohort, the default rate went from 15.5 percent for FY 2014 to 15.6 percent for FY 2015. Proprietary schools accounted for approximately 38 percent of the total number of schools. Additionally, 405 foreign schools saw their rate remain at 3.5 percent for FY 2014 and FY 2015. Foreign institutions make up nearly 7 percent of all postsecondary schools. The Department's default management website provides information about the national student loan default rate, as well as rates by individual schools, states, types of postsecondary institutions, and other details. Sanctions Schools with high default rates may lose their eligibility to participate in federal student aid programs. This year, 12 schools are subject to sanctions, including one public, two private, and nine proprietary institutions. Those schools include: CA—Corona—Advance Beauty Techs Academy FL—Oakland Park—Florida Academy of Health and Beauty IL—Chicago—Larry's Barber College KY—Cumberland—Southeast Kentucky Community and Technical College MA—Worcester—Rob Roy Academy NY—Niagara Falls—Cheryl Fell's School of Business NY—Rochester—Sharp Edge Barber Institute ND—Bismarck—United Tribes Technical College PA—Lancaster—Champ's Barber School PR—Saint Just—Theological University of the Caribbean TN—Madison—Nashville Barber and Style Academy WI—Beloit—First Class Cosmetology School Five schools are subject to a loss of eligibility based on a cohort default rate of 40 percent or more for one year, while five schools are subject to a loss of eligibility based on a cohort default rate of 30 percent or greater for three years. Two schools are subject to a loss of eligibility based on a cohort default rate of 40 percent or more for one year and a rate of 30 percent or greater for three years. In certain circumstances, schools may avoid sanctions by submitting a successful adjustment, appeal, or data challenge. All institutions with a default rate that is equal to or greater than 30 percent must establish a default prevention task force that prepares a plan to identify the factors causing the school's cohort default rate to exceed 30 percent and submit the plan to the Department. Two schools subject to sanctions for high FY 2014 and FY 2015 cohort default rates—Southeast Kentucky Community and Technical College and United Tribes Technical College—will not lose eligibility to participate in the federal student aid programs, if certain conditions are met, due to a provision written into the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018 . The provision, which will last until the end of FY 2019, permits the secretary to exempt schools located in high poverty areas with high default rates. The Department's office of Federal Student Aid provides extensive assistance to higher education institutions, including webinars and online training; state, regional, and national association training forums; and face-to-face training events. Resources to Help Borrowers Manage Student Loan Debt The Department offers a wealth of information and resources to assist borrowers with successfully managing their federal student loan debt. In addition to helping borrowers find an affordable repayment plan at StudentAid.gov/repay , the Department contacts borrowers through email outreach campaigns, offers loan counseling that allows borrowers the ability to select their repayment plan based on their individual circumstances during exit counseling, and answers questions in real-time via social media. Borrowers will receive even more support in managing their student loan debt once the Next Generation (Next Gen) Financial Services Environment is implemented. In part, Next Gen will allow Federal Student Aid to further enhance its outreach to borrowers—through a mobile-first, mobile-complete, mobile-continuous platform—designed to help borrowers make informed decisions about their entire educational experience, including successful loan repayment."

The camp, which was open to Washington, D.C. area girls who attend Title 1 Schools, doubled in size with support from the Department of Education. President Donald J. Trump donated his second quarter salary to the Department of Education to fund a STEM-focused camp. At the camp, students learned about the science of flight and were exposed to a wide array of aviation-related activities and career paths. During the Secretary's visit she worked with a group of girls to build and fly their own drones, was a passenger in an FAA-certified flight simulator and toured the Boeing Aviation Hangar. ""It was a joy to be with this promising group of young girls as they discovered just how fun and interesting STEM can be,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""I hope this experience inspires and empowers them to explore STEM career fields and perhaps become our future astronauts, cyber security experts and airplane pilots."" This year the Department will invest more than $200 million dollars in discretionary grants to promote STEM education."

The program assists with the cost of educating students displaced by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria or the 2017 California wildfires. ""The impact of natural disasters like hurricanes and wildfires goes beyond the disaster area. The effects are felt nationwide, especially in those communities that take in displaced students and families,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""This additional funding will ensure schools serving displaced students are able to meet their unique needs under such difficult circumstances."" Under the Emergency Impact Aid program, the Department is authorized to award funds to eligible state educational agencies (SEAs) to enable them to make payments to eligible local educational agencies (LEAs) and eligible Bureau of Indian Education (BIE)-funded schools for the cost of educating during the 2017-2018 school year public and non-public school students displaced by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, or the 2017 California wildfires. These awards were made based on the quarterly counts of displaced students that are included in the SEA applications for Emergency Impact Aid. The statute specifies that the annual per-pupil amounts shall be the sum of $9,000 for each displaced student who is an English learner, $10,000 for each displaced student who is a child with a disability; and $8,500 for each student who is not reported as a child with a disability or an English learner. Congress appropriated a combined amount of approximately $2.5 billion for Immediate Aid to Restart School Operations (Restart) and Emergency Impact Aid programs. The amounts awarded under each program are based on demand and specific data received from eligible applicants. The Department anticipates granting a second round of Emergency Impact Aid awards in the coming weeks which will include awards for both California and Puerto Rico. Twenty states and the U.S. Virgin Islands received awards in the amounts of: State Amount Alabama $110,750 Connecticut $10,644,625 Delaware $636,875 Florida $95,811,000 Iowa $594,000 Kansas $1,470,125 Louisiana $963,500 Maryland $963,375 Massachusetts $15,541,125 Michigan $669,375 Minnesota $958,250 Mississippi $629,250 New Hampshire $618,375 New Jersey $10,909,875 New York $15,942,000 Ohio $6,261,250 Pennsylvania $13,876,500 South Carolina $304,000 Texas $174,242,375 Virgin Islands $4,156,125 Wisconsin $3,536,875 Total $359,832,250 For additional information on the programs for K-12 schools and school districts, please contact Paul Kesner at Paul.Kesner@ed.gov ."

""Students deserve useful and relevant data when making important decisions about their education post-high school,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. ""That's why instead of targeting schools simply by their tax status, this administration is working to ensure students have transparent, meaningful information about all colleges and all programs. Our new approach will aid students across all sectors of higher education and improve accountability."" The Department continues to believe that data such as debt levels, expected earnings after graduation, completion rates, program cost, accreditation, and consistency with licensure requirements are important to consumers, but not just those students who are considering enrolling in a gainful employment program. Therefore, in the NPRM the Department invites public comment concerning whether or not the Department should require institutions to disclose, on the program webpage, information about the program size, its completion rate, its cost, whether or not it is accredited, and whether the program meets the requirements for licensure in the State in which the institution is located. In addition, to provide prospective students with important, actionable, and accurate information that could be used in college enrollment and borrowing decisions, the Department plans to update the College Scorecard or a similar web-based tool to provide program-level outcomes including, at a minimum, median debt and median earnings for all higher education programs, at all title IV participating institutions. The Department believes that this will improve transparency by providing comparable information for all programs and helping students understand what earnings they might expect based on those of prior graduates. This would also increase accountability of institutions by making it more difficult for institutions to misrepresent program outcomes, such as the earnings of prior graduates, since prospective students would have access to accurate data provided by the Secretary of Education. The 30-day public comment period for these proposed regulations will begin once published in the Federal Register. In the interim, an unofficial version of the proposed rule can be found here ."

I look forward to seeing the results.” Louisiana’s innovative assessments will measure student understanding in English language arts (ELA) and social studies by assessing students on passages from books used in daily classroom instruction at regular intervals, rather than randomly-selected texts once during the school year. Louisiana will pilot its innovative assessments in 20 high schools, across three districts and two charter networks, serving nearly 21,000 students. The Innovative Assessment Demonstration Authority (IADA) program is designed to lower barriers to innovation and encourage local involvement in the development of the next generation of assessments. As part of the program, states can pilot new and innovative assessments on a small scale, avoid double-testing students on both pilot and statewide exams and develop strategies for implementing such innovative assessments statewide over time. To participate in the pilot, states must apply and demonstrate how their innovative assessments are developed in collaboration with local stakeholders, aligned to challenging state academic standards and accessible to all students through use of principles of universal design for learning, among other requirements."

The Institutional Accountability regulations, which were published on the Department's website today, come after months of public hearings and negotiated rulemaking that engaged a wide variety of higher education stakeholders. ""Our commitment and our focus has been and remains on protecting students from fraud,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. ""The regulations proposed today accomplish that by laying out clear rules of the road for higher education institutions to follow and holding institutions, rather than hardworking taxpayers, accountable for making whole those students who were harmed by an institution's deceptive practices."" The proposed Institutional Accountability regulations include provisions that would: Put into place a borrower defense to repayment adjudication process that is clear, consistent and fair to borrowers who were harmed by institutional misconduct Replace the current ""state standard"" for adjudicating claims with a Federal standard that clearly defines misrepresentation and enables more expeditious review of student claims Facilitate collection and review of evidence for deciding claims and ensure that the Secretary of Education can recoup from institutions the financial losses associated with successful borrower defense claims Encourage students to seek remedies directly from institutions that have committed acts of misrepresentation Expand from 120 days to 180 days the period of time during which students who left an institution prior to its closure are eligible for a closed school loan discharge while at the same time incentivize closing institutions to engage in orderly teach-outs, which enable more students to complete their program Ensure that institutions requiring students to engage in mandatory arbitration or prohibiting them from participating in class action lawsuits provide plain language explanations of these provisions to enable students to make an informed enrollment decision Prevent guaranty agencies from charging borrowers a fee if a defaulted loan goes into repayment within 60 days Protect taxpayers by requiring institutions to post a letter of credit when events occur that put the institution's continuing operations or financial stability at risk The proposed regulations will be open for public comment for 30 days upon official publication in the Federal Register . In addition to seeking public comment on all provisions of the proposed regulation, the Department has included a directed question asking for public comment on two different approaches to accepting borrower defense to repayment claims, which include: Accepting ""defensive"" claims only, which limit borrower defense claims to defaulted borrowers who are in a collections proceeding; or Accepting both ""defensive"" and ""affirmative"" claims, including from borrowers still in repayment Because the implications of this determination are far-reaching for taxpayers and borrowers, the Department is seeking comment on how to balance the need to protect borrowers from acts of institutional fraud with the need to protect taxpayers from the high cost of unjustified claims.

This initial award to the Georgia Department of Education was made in the amount of approximately $94,500. The Department has made initial awards to five additional SEAs: California Department of Education, Florida Department of Education, Puerto Rico Department of Education, Texas Education Agency and the U.S. Virgin Islands Department of Education. Award amounts were developed based on information provided by the SEAs in their applications, including the number of schools affected as a result of a covered disaster or emergency and how long they were closed. Congress appropriated a combined amount of approximately $2.5 billion for both the K-12 Restart and Emergency Impact Aid for Displaced Students (K-12 Displaced Students) programs. The amounts awarded under each program will be based on demand and specific data received from eligible applicants. The Department released the application for the K-12 Displaced Students program on April 25.

Each state crafted a plan that it feels will best offer educational opportunities to meet the needs of the state and its students. The following are some of the unique elements from Oklahoma’s approved plan as highlighted by the state: Oklahoma’s approach to school improvement hinges on partnerships between the state and district that push beyond compliance and focus on on-site coaching and guidance for academic success. A comprehensive needs assessment will identify unique focal areas for each site that inform planning, evidence-based interventions and budget alignment. Oklahoma will utilize the school report card dashboard to recognize and reward schools for Programs of Excellence that emphasize the importance of a well-rounded education. “We are pleased that the U.S. Department of Education’s approval of Oklahoma Edge, our state’s eight-year strategic plan for public education, maintains its original intent and our steadfast belief that all students can grow and all schools can improve,” said Joy Hofmeister, Oklahoma superintendent of public instruction. “The plan, full of innovative approaches to the long-term success our students deserve and Oklahomans value, reflects countless hours of engagement with educators and more than 5,000 individual pieces of stakeholder feedback.”"

The model is designed to equitably allocate local, state and federal resources based on student needs. ""Puerto Rico's use of a student-centered funding system will help to ensure those with the greatest need receive the most support"" said Secretary DeVos. ""Amid the hardships and challenges following Hurricane Maria, I am pleased to see Puerto Rico rethinking school and putting students' needs above all else."" Added Puerto Rico Secretary of Education Julia Keleher, ""Puerto Rico's ability to provide a quality education for its youth depends on how we fund K-12 education and the way funds are allocated. This pilot allows us to take a more scientific approach and track the relationship between strategic investments and future learning gains. We are committed to implementing effective solutions that benefit our students and ensure accountability to our families."" ESSA provides for 50 school districts to pilot a new student-centered funding system that combines local, state and federal dollars. This innovative approach allows maximal resources to be allocated to schools based on quantifiable student need, directing the most resources to support students who need them most. The result is a more equitable, predictable and transparent method of allocating resources that puts students first. ESSA specifically requires that pilot districts allocate substantially more funding to support students from low-income families, English learners, and any other educationally disadvantaged group as chosen by the school district. Puerto Rico designed its system to allocate additional funds to support students from low-income families, language learners and students in rural schools. Any other interested school district can apply to participate in the pilot program by July 15, 2018, for implementation beginning in the 2019-2020 school year.

OCR’s investigation will assess USC’s response to reports and complaints of sexual harassment during pelvic exams as early as 1990 that were not fully investigated by the University until spring 2016 and that the University did not disclose to OCR during an earlier investigation. “No student should ever endure sexual harassment or abuse while trying to pursue their education,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. “Every student on every campus should have a safe learning environment, and I expect all education institutions under the Department’s jurisdiction to take seriously their responsibilities under Title IX. Attempts to obfuscate or hide Title IX violations from the Department will not be tolerated, and I am calling on USC to cooperate fully and completely with this investigation.” According to USC, Dr. Tyndall resigned in June 2017 based on a finding by the university that his behavior during pelvic exams was outside the scope of current medical standards and that he violated the university’s policy on harassment by making repeated sexually inappropriate remarks during patient encounters. OCR currently has an unrelated monitoring agreement with USC as a result of OCR’s investigations into the university's handling of allegations of sexual harassment and sexual violence that spanned from August 2010 through May 2015. The resolution agreement reached with USC in case numbers 09-13-2294 and 09-16-2128 was entered into on Jan. 28, 2018. OCR’s requests for documents and information from USC during the investigation of these matters covered all reports and complaints against staff and faculty during the 2010-2013 academic years. However, at no time during the investigation or negotiations did USC provide OCR with any information regarding reports or complaints allegedly received against Dr. Tyndall. Based on these new compliance issues raised by the information disclosed by USC in public statements and through recent media reports, OCR is opening a new directed investigation. OCR policy is to open a systemic investigation when the allegations support a broad review of an institution’s handling of civil rights issues."

The students come from more than 30,000 public, private and military schools from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Outlying Areas – American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands and the U.S. Virgin Islands – and American military bases abroad. “I am honored to join the President, your community and your school in recognizing you with the 2018 award,” Secretary DeVos wrote in a congratulatory letter to each recipient. “As we celebrate this accomplishment, I also encourage you to continue on the path that led to your selection. Education is a lifelong process of learning and discovery that offers unlimited rewards for those that thirst for knowledge and are willing to work hard. By setting standards for yourself, by utilizing the educational opportunities before you and by diligently striving to reach your goals, you are well on your way towards reaping those rewards.” PEAP was founded in 1983. Every year since then, the program has provided the nation’s schools with the opportunity to recognize graduating students who meet high standards of academic excellence and those who have given their best effort, often overcoming obstacles to their learning. Each year, eligible graduating K-12 students are selected by their school principal for recognition in two categories. The President’s Award for Educational Excellence - This award recognizes academic success in the classroom. To be eligible, students must meet requirements, including grade point average or other school-set criteria and choice of state tests or teacher recommendations. The President’s Award for Educational Achievement - This award recognizes students that show outstanding educational growth, improvement, commitment or intellectual development in their academic subjects but do not meet the criteria for the Educational Excellence Award. Its purpose is to encourage and reward students who give their best effort, often in the face of special obstacles. Criterion for this award is developed at each school. Individual recognition is bestowed by the President and the U.S. Secretary of Education, in partnership with the National Association of Elementary School Principals and the National Association of Secondary School Principals. The award includes a congratulatory letter to the student and certificate signed by the President, the Secretary and the school principal. Unlike other awards programs, the principal has sole discretion in choosing recipients based on eligibility. There is no limit on the number of awards, as long as students meet the criteria for each award set by the school. A list of 2018 President’s Education Awards participating schools by state and territory is available here ."

Each state crafted a plan that it feels will best offer educational opportunities to meet the needs of the state and its students. The following are some of the unique elements from Nebraska’s approved plan as highlighted by the state: Establishes ambitious, but attainable long-term goals in alignment with its strategic vision and direction. The state seeks to reduce the number of non-proficient students in each subgroup by at least 50 percent within 10 years Plans to include chronic absenteeism, science and the evidence-based analysis indicator to measure school quality or student success. English Learner proficiency will be used as a new stand-alone indicator Driven by ESSA’s consultation process and seeking to address disparities across and within school districts, Nebraska is collaboratively establishing statewide, shared definitions for “educational equity” and “leading for equity.” “The Nebraska Department of Education is pleased to have worked closely with the U.S. Department of Education to align Nebraska’s ESSA plan involving federal supports for school improvement with the state’s accountability system, Accountability for a Quality Education Today and Tomorrow,” said Nebraska Commissioner of Education Matthew Blomstedt. “The combined approach strengthens Nebraska’s ability to address local school system needs with customized supports for school improvement. Nebraska will be able to leverage state and federal resources for schools most in need of support for improvement based on strong equity principles established in both the historical context of the federal Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) and Nebraska’s mission to prepare all students for learning, earning and living. ” Below are unique elements from North Carolina’s approved plan as highlighted by the state: Provides a concise statement of the innovation the state expects for students, including using adaptive environments, personalized learning and empowered educators Establishes 10-year goals for student performance using end-of-grade and end-of-course exams, and goals for closing achievement gaps Continues the School Performance Grades model in which schools earn A-F grades based on proficiency measures and student-growth targets. “Our ESSA plan is consistent with our efforts to transform our education system to allow every student to follow the path to success that they decide best fits them,” said North Carolina State Superintendent Mark Johnson. “We are changing our industrial-age practices of providing the same inputs and opportunities to all and moving to digital-age practices in which all students and educators have access to individualized learning experiences.”"

The remarks will kick off a ten day multi-stop learning tour including the exploration of apprenticeship programs in Switzerland, both vocational and primary school education in the Netherlands and the move towards a decentralized, school-led K-12 education system in the United Kingdom. ""There is much to learn from our European counterparts as they continue to advance education options centered on the needs of individual students and focused on their ability to succeed in the modern economy,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""The proof is in the results as Switzerland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom continue to out-perform American students on the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA). I look forward to this important opportunity to learn from European education leaders and to exchange ideas on how to ensure America's students have access to the lifelong learning journey that will put them on the path to success."" All school visits and meetings are closed to the express except for the International Congress on Vocational and Professional Education and Training. The agenda for the multi-stop tour is as follows: Switzerland: Vocational education and training is an integral part of the Swiss education system with close ties to the labor market, frequently combining apprenticeships and classroom instruction. Apprenticeships are highly valued and competitive in Switzerland where 65% of students in upper secondary education are enrolled in pre-vocational or vocational programs. Among those who choose vocational programs, ninety-three percent are enrolled in joint vocational programs combining school and work-based elements.

The Commission heard from administrators, principals, teachers, students and a national expert about Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS), a framework designed to improve social, emotional and academic outcomes for all students. The Commission was represented by FCSS Chair U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos; Beth Williams, Assistant Attorney General for Legal Policy at the Department of Justice; Dr. Elinore McCance-Katz, Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Abuse at the Department of Health and Human Services; and Christopher Krebs, performing the duties of Under Secretary for the National Protection and Programs Directorate at the Department of Homeland Security. The field visit began with a tour of several first grade classrooms. The Commission participated in Angela Snyder's morning community circle activity where everyone welcomed their neighbor with a greeting and fist-bump, followed by several discussion questions to promote kindness. The group then visited Alexandra Lyons' class to take part in a reading activity and finished the tour with a visit to Kimberly Chicca's class where they worked with students on writing prompts for a book they were reading. Following the tour, the Commission first heard from national PBIS expert Dr. George Sugai of the University of Connecticut, who gave an overview of how PBIS links school climate, social emotional development and character development and emphasizes a systems-based approach to organizing practices. Next, Kathy Lane, Dr. Virginia Dolan and Kathy Rockefeller presented on Anne Arundel County Public Schools' implementation of PBIS within Hebron-Harman and throughout the school district. After a lunch provided by the school cafeteria, there were three panels led by principals and administrators, teachers and a student. Participants of each panel are listed below. Principal and administrator panel: Rebecca Blasingame-White, Frank Hebron-Harman Elementary School Paul DeRoo, Bates Middle School Jason Williams, Northeast High School Stacey Smith, Old Mill High School Teacher panel: Alicia Schnitzler, Frank Hebron-Harman Elementary School Casey Hunt, Bates Middle School Chessil Johnson, Northeast High School Angela Bernholz, Old Mill High School Student presentation: Briah Barksdale, Glen Burnie High School The field visit concluded with a question and answer session between the Commission and panelists. Secretary DeVos asked panelists how educators could ensure their PBIS practices remain fresh and flexible based upon students' varying needs, and how administrators could best ensure effective implementation of the program in schools over time. Secretary DeVos offered the following comments: ""Today's field visit was a very useful look at how schools can take deliberate steps to help make students feel included and valued. Tools like PBIS can help improve school climate and, in turn, safety. We also benefited greatly from the presentations of the experts, educators and students. As the Commission's work proceeds, we will continue to visit places where concrete steps have been taken to help keep our students safe."" Video of the event can be found here ."

The grant will help with recovery efforts following the tragic shootings at Santa Fe High School in Texas, on May 18, 2018. “No student, parent or educator should have to experience the trauma suffered by so many at Santa Fe High School and other schools throughout the country,” said Secretary DeVos. This initial SERV grant will help to provide essential services that will aid in the healing and recovery process. Every day, the work of the Federal Commission on School Safety grows more urgent. We continue to focus on identifying proven ways to prevent violence and keep our students safe at school. The Department’s Project SERV grants provide critical funding for school districts, colleges and universities that have experienced significant traumatic events and need resources to respond, recover and re-establish safe environments for students. There are two types of Project SERV awards—Immediate Services and Extended Services. Immediate Services grants provide emergency, short-term assistance to affected school districts or colleges and universities. Extended Services grants assist school districts and colleges and universities in carrying out the long-term recovery efforts that may be needed following a significant, traumatic event. Santa Fe Independent School District received an Immediate Services grant. Secretary DeVos and Department officials are in frequent contact with state and local education leaders in Texas as they assess their needs in the wake of this tragedy."

This limited opportunity—which the Department is referring to as Temporary Expanded PSLF (TEPSLF)—was made possible by a $350-million appropriation through the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018. The law provides additional conditions under which borrowers may become eligible for loan forgiveness if some or all of their payments made on William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan (Direct Loan) Program loans were made on a nonqualifying repayment plan for the PSLF Program. This opportunity is only available on a first-come, first-served basis until the $350 million has been allocated or other criteria are met. The Department will reconsider eligibility for the TEPSLF opportunity using an expanded list of qualifying repayment plans, which includes the Graduated Repayment Plan, Extended Repayment Plan, Consolidated Standard Repayment Plan, and Consolidated Graduated Repayment Plan. Funds for this opportunity are limited, and borrowers will be considered on a first come, first serve basis. Once funds under this opportunity are depleted or other criteria are met, the program will end. In order to qualify for the TEPSLF opportunity, a borrower must have done the following: Submitted the Public Service Loan Forgiveness: Application for Forgiveness and had that application denied because some or all of the payments were not made under a qualifying repayment plan for PSLF Worked at least 10 years of full-time employment with a qualifying employer, certified by the employer, and approved by the Department Made 120 qualifying monthly payments under the new requirements for the TEPSLF opportunity while working full-time for a qualifying employer or employers Borrowers who believe they may qualify for the TEPSLF opportunity should email a request for reconsideration to TEPSLF@MyFedLoan.org .

The award announced today is the first in a multiphase award process designed to provide prompt initial funding while offering subsequent opportunities for additional assistance through future applications. “As the U.S. Virgin Islands continue to recover from Hurricane Irma and Maria, this additional funding will help them restore a safe and healthy learning environment,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. “I look forward to the Department’s continued work with Commissioner McCollum and her team as well as Governor Mapp as we work together to ensure students and teachers have the resources they need now and in the future.” Under the K-12 Restart program, the Department is authorized to award funds to State educational agencies (SEAs) with students and schools impacted by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria and the 2017 California wildfires. These SEAs, in turn, will provide assistance or services to local educational agencies (LEAs), including charter schools and private schools, to help defray expenses related to restarting school operations and restoring the normal learning environment for students and families. This initial award to the U.S. Virgin Islands Department of Education (VIDE) was made in the amount of $13,100,000. The Department has made initial awards to three additional SEAs: California Department of Education (CDE), Puerto Rico Department of Education (PRDE) and Texas Education Agency (TEA). Award amounts were developed based on information provided by the SEAs in their applications, including the number of schools affected as a result of a covered disaster or emergency and how long they were closed. Congress appropriated a combined amount of approximately $2.5 billion for both the Restart and Emergency Impact Aid for Displaced Students (K-12 Displaced Students) programs. The amounts awarded under each program will be based on demand and specific data received from eligible applicants. The Department released the application for the K-12 Displaced Students program on April 25. For additional information on the programs for K-12 schools and school districts, please contact Paul Kesner at Paul.Kesner@ed.gov"

""I want to congratulate this year's class of Presidential Scholars on their achievement and also thank their parents, teachers and other academic advisors who have helped guide them along the way,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. ""These students have pushed themselves to be the best they can be, and I am certain that devotion will serve them well as they continue their individual learning journeys."" The White House Commission on Presidential Scholars selects scholars annually based on their academic success, artistic excellence, essays, school evaluations and transcripts, as well as evidence of community service, leadership and demonstrated commitment to high ideals. Of the 3.6 million students expected to graduate from high school this year, more than 5,200 candidates qualified for the 2018 awards determined by outstanding performance on the College Board SAT and ACT exams, through nominations made by Chief State School Officers , other partner recognition organizations or the National YoungArts Foundation's nationwide YoungArts™ competition . The 2018 U.S. Presidential Scholars are comprised of one young man and one young woman from each state, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, and from U.S. families living abroad, as well as 15 chosen at-large, 20 U.S. Presidential Scholars in the Arts and 20 U.S. Presidential Scholars in Career and Technical Education. Created in 1964, the U.S. Presidential Scholars Program has honored almost 7,500 of the nation's top-performing students with the prestigious award given to honorees during the annual ceremony in Washington. The program was expanded in 1979 to recognize students who demonstrate exceptional talent in the visual, literary and performing arts. In 2015, the program was again extended to recognize students who demonstrate ability and accomplishment in career and technical education fields. The 2018 ceremony will be held June 24, when each honoree will receive a Presidential Scholar Medallion.

""I am pleased to approve these plans which comply with the requirements of the law,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""I encourage states to use their plans as a starting point, rather than a finish line, to improve outcomes for all students."" Allowing states more flexibility in how they deliver education to students is at the core of ESSA. Each state crafted a plan that it feels will best offer educational opportunities to meet the needs of the state and its students. ALABAMA The following are some of the unique elements from Alabama's approved plan as highlighted by the state: Alabama requires the State Superintendent of Education to develop a school grading system reflective of school and district performance and to create the Legislative School Performance Recognition Program. The state will use state-authorized assessments and other key performance indicators that give a total profile of the school or school system, or both. Alabama will work with local education agencies (LEAs) to enhance early learning and improve coordination and alignment of early learning programs from birth through third grade. ""Alabama's plan builds a solid foundation and gives us a springboard from which to launch important improvement initiatives including the governor's Strong Start, Strong Finish program,"" said Alabama State Superintendent of Education Eric Mackey. ""By incorporating high academic standards and clear expectations with plans for greater student engagement and achievement, Alabama stands ready to meet the rigorous demands of preparing students for the work force and for their roles as citizens in our democratic system. We are honored to have our plan approved, and now we go to work on its implementation."" COLORADO The following are some of the unique elements from Colorado's approved plan as highlighted by the state: Colorado created the ESSA Application for School Improvement (EASI), a one-stop process for LEAs with schools identified for Comprehensive and Targeted Support and Improvement to access services and funding specifically tailored to the unique needs of each identified school. Colorado is establishing an aligned, tiered system of grants performance management with a focus on continuous academic improvement and equitable access for all students, particularly historically underserved students. Colorado's ESSA plan reaffirms the state's longstanding commitment to a rich, balanced and well-rounded education for all students by ensuring that professional development and other support for schools and teachers will continue to focus on all content areas. ""We are pleased that our plan is approved,"" said Colorado Education Commissioner Katy Anthes.""We have used this process to re-engage with many of our schools, districts and stakeholders across the state over the last two years to get feedback on how our current education system is working.The conversations were deep and very helpful to the department and other stakeholders as we work collectively to leverage ESSA to improve outcomes for our highest need students in Colorado."" KENTUCKY The following are some of the unique elements from Kentucky's approved plan as highlighted by the state: Kentucky's plan includes ambitious interim and long-term goals on which to measure progress including increasing academic achievement significantly for all students; cutting the achievement gap for each student group in half by 2030; and increasing the graduation rate significantly for all students and each student group. Under the plan, 2017-18 will be a transition year whereby performance on the indicators for which data is available will be used to determine low-performing schools and whether targeted support and improvement (TSI) or comprehensive support and improvement (CSI) will be provided. The system will be fully implemented in the 2018-19 school year when performance on all of the indicators will combine and lead to a one to five-star designation for a school or district. A school with significant achievement gaps will be disqualified from earning the highest ratings. ""Schools and districts will be held to a higher level of accountability under this plan. Raising the bar is essential if Kentucky is to make the strides in student performance that we intend to make,"" Interim Commissioner Wayne Lewis said. ""I am most excited about the unprecedented focus on closing Kentucky's achievement gaps, emphasis on students' readiness for success in careers and postsecondary education and a much more transparent and easy to understand rating system for schools."""

Each state crafted a plan that it feels will best offer educational opportunities to meet the needs of the state and its students. The following are some of the unique elements from South Carolina’s approved plan as highlighted by the state: The differentiated model for meeting interim targets based upon each school’s baseline allows the statewide goals to be individualized to a particular school. Measures nine different ways a student can demonstrate college and career readiness by the time they graduate high school. These differentiated college and career readiness metrics allow students to drive their post-secondary goals and maximize the world class knowledge and skills of the Profile of the South Carolina Graduate. Reports on their level of engagement and academic opportunities through the student engagement survey. Having the student “voice” in the accountability system is a first for South Carolina. “South Carolina’s ESSA plan embodies our vision that every graduate is prepared for success in college, career and citizenship,” said South Carolina Superintendent of Education Molly Spearman. “This vision is carried out using multiple metrics to deliver rigorous and personalized instruction to every student.” The following are some of the unique elements from Virginia’s approved plan as highlighted by the state: Creates a multi-step process to identify schools for support and improvement that emphasizes the importance of academic growth and English learner progress. Includes two new indicators—chronic absenteeism and the Standards of Accreditation Rating indicator—to measure school quality and student success. “Virginia's ESSA plan reflects the state's mission to increase student learning and academic achievement,” Virginia Acting Superintendent of Public Instruction Steven M. Constantino said. “The wide range of strategies articulated in the plan—which include supporting identified schools, improving school conditions for student learning and identifying and addressing disproportionate rates of access to quality educators—reflect Virginia's commitment to ensure an excellent education for all students.”"

It is important that, in return, we do all we can to give them the support and care they deserve,” U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said. “Simplifying the loan forgiveness process and proactively identifying veterans with federal student loans who may be eligible for a discharge is a small but critical way we can show our gratitude for veterans’ service.” Acting VA Secretary Robert Wilkie said, “The hard work put into this important initiative by two large federal agencies for our veterans and their families is impressive in scope and further underscores VA’s values. I want to thank Secretary DeVos and her team for partnering in this wonderful effort for those who have given so much.” Starting this month, the Department will begin matching borrowers on the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS®), who have federal student loans or aid through the Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant Program, to the VA database. Borrowers positively identified in the match will be mailed a customized letter that will explain eligibility for loan discharge and include a total and permanent disability (TPD) application. The borrower can sign and return the application to complete the process of applying for a TPD discharge.

13-Apr-18,https://web.archive.org/web/20210108025343/https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/expanding-pathways-success-after-high-school-us-department-education-approves-first-innovative-equip-experiment,"Expanding Pathways to Success After High School, U.S. Department of Education Approves First Innovative EQUIP Experiment","WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Department of Education announced today that Brookhaven College, part of the Dallas County Community College District (DCCCD), is the first to receive final approval to enroll students in the Educational Quality through Innovation Partnerships (EQUIP) experiment. Experimental sites, like this one, give the Department flexibility to waive specific statutory or regulatory requirements associated with disbursing Title IV student aid in order to assess the efficacy of innovative educational solutions. Through the EQUIP experiment, students will be allowed, for the first time, to use federal student aid to enroll in programs offered by innovative, nontraditional education providers that are partnering with accredited colleges or universities. These partnerships seek to expand educational opportunities for students while experimenting with new quality assurance and accountability mechanisms. After rigorous analysis and approval by both the institution's accrediting agency and the Department, Brookhaven is set to begin collaborating with StraighterLine, an online provider of self-paced educational courses. Students who have some college but no credential will be able to complete up to two-thirds of a DCCCD associate's degree with a concentration in business or criminal justice by enrolling in StraighterLine courses. The Council for Higher Education Accreditation will provide quality assurance oversight of the DCCCD EQUIP experiment. ""Nontraditional students comprise the fastest growing student segment in higher education,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. ""These students are looking for new, more efficient and lower-cost ways to earn workplace-relevant credentials, oftentimes while working and raising a family. Through these experimental sites, we can provide students with new options that, until now, existed only outside of the federal financial aid system."" Background on EQUIP As a result of restrictions outlined in the Higher Education Act, a college or university receiving federal student aid cannot allow a non-accredited education provider to deliver more than 50 percent of an educational program. Meanwhile, some of these non-accredited providers offer the most innovative solutions to help students enter the workplace more quickly and considerably boost their earnings. The EQUIP experiment provides an exemption from the normal federal student aid rules, allowing a nontraditional provider to exceed the 50 percent cap, thereby providing low-income students with greater access to new types of programs. EQUIP experiment applications were evaluated on five criteria: Innovating to Improve Outcomes: The extent to which the proposed activities will produce innovative, high-quality programs likely to lead to positive student learning and employment outcomes; Equity and Access: The extent to which the programs will provide equitable access to high-quality postsecondary education programs, particularly for students from low-income backgrounds; Quality Assurance: The extent to which the proposed quality assurance processes have the potential to address key questions about how best to evaluate and ensure the quality of these programs and nontraditional providers; Affordability: The extent to which the programs are affordable; Student and Taxpayer Protections: Particularly for programs in which students will have access to federal student loans, the strength of proposed student and taxpayer protections."

U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos issued the following statement in response: “The report card is in, and the results are clear: We can and we must do better for America’s students. Our nation’s reading and math scores continue to stagnate. More alarmingly, the gap between the highest and lowest performing students is widening, despite billions in Federal funding designated specifically to help close it. “One bright spot in today’s report is Florida, where Sunshine State students are bucking the national trend, showing significant improvement in 4th and 8th grade math and in 8th grade reading. Both low and high performers in Florida demonstrated that improvement, again bucking the national trend and narrowing the achievement gap. “Florida leaders, administrators, and, most importantly, teachers are to be commended for their continued efforts on behalf of students. Florida has been at the forefront of bold, comprehensive education reform for decades. From accountability, to literacy, to teacher certification and recognition, to providing parents more freedom to select the learning environment that best fits their students’ needs, Florida is rethinking education. “Florida’s results show what is possible when we focus on individual students. This Administration is committed to working with States and communities across our country to bring about the much-needed change our students deserve. “Many thanks to the professional staff at the National Center for Education Statistics and the members of the National Assessment Governing Board for their work and for their commitment to continually improving NAEP.”"

The discussion focused on the Dear Colleague Letter (DCL or the guidance) regarding Title VI, which prohibits racial discrimination, and school discipline that was jointly issued by the Departments of Education and Justice on January 8, 2014. The two sessions were one hundred minutes each, grouped as follows: 1. Fifteen participants representing themselves or organizations that shared positive experiences under the current guidance. Organizations and individual participants included: National Education Association American Association of University Women National Association for the Advancement of Colored People Legal Defense & Education Fund Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights Educators for Excellence An administrator from Illinois A teacher from California A teacher from Massachusetts A teacher from New York A teacher from Minnesota An administrator from Connecticut Professors from two state universities 2.

Each session took place in the Secretary’s Conference Room to foster a candid exchange between the Secretary and stakeholders who presented varying perspectives on how school discipline policies should or should not change. The Secretary opened each session by marking the 50th anniversary of the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and highlighting the continued need to achieve the full realization of his life's work. She discussed the clear problem, revealed both in the data and in the stories told, of disparate treatment in discipline. She welcomed the participants to share their perspectives on how to best protect all students' civil rights and promote positive school climates, and asked how the current approach is helping or hurting those efforts. Topics discussed during the first session included: the need to address the unique needs of students holistically; how the guidance helped force conversations around school discipline practices; how implementation of reforms has been problematic in some instances; and the importance of a safe school climate to improving student achievement. Topics discussed during the second session included: teachers being denied discretion in discipline decisions, leading to disruptions and violent episodes; legal and procedural flaws in the previous administration’s approach of enforcing the guidance; districts underreporting school discipline issues; and the impact of school violence on both teacher retention and student well-being.

The review is a direct result of action by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia remanding the case to the Secretary. “As the court ordered, we will fairly consider all of the facts presented and make an appropriate determination on ACICS’s petition,” said DeVos. On March 23, 2018, the court remanded to the Secretary the December 12, 2016 decision of then-Secretary John King withdrawing the recognition of ACICS. Calling the Department’s decision-making process “flawed,” the court ruled that the prior administration violated not only the Higher Education Act and the Department’s own implementing regulations, but also the Administrative Procedures Act when it ignored certain evidence and data the Department had requested from ACICS. As directed by the court, Secretary DeVos will consider this evidence and data in connection with a review of the petition for continued recognition filed by ACICS in January 2016 and has ordered ACICS to file a written submission with the Department by no later than May 30, 2018. As a result of the district court’s remand, there is no final decision on the recognition petition ACICS submitted to the Department in January 2016, and ACICS retains its status as a federally recognized accrediting agency pending the Secretary’s final agency decision on remand. The Department will not conduct any further review of ACICS’s pending petition for initial recognition submitted by ACICS in December 2017, and ACICS will be removed from the agenda for the May 2018 meeting of the National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity.

Reynold Verret, President of Xavier University of Louisiana added, ""We are deeply grateful for the bipartisan legislative efforts and to the Trump administration for relief of the Katrina loans to Xavier University of Louisiana and our partner HBCUs. Forgiveness of the loans removes a great impediment to innovation and the delivery of superlative education to talented women and men who build and sustain our communities, cities and nations."" The next meeting of the HBCU Capital Financing Advisory Board, which provides advice regarding the HBCU Capital Financing Program, will be held on Tuesday, April 3, on the campus of St. Philip's College, an HBCU in San Antonio, Texas. Meeting details will be published in the Federal Register."

Since September 2017, the Department has provided more than $13 million in additional relief funds through the FSEOG program to colleges and universities for undergraduate students with exceptional financial need. Separately, the Department will deliver $17.5 million through the Federal Work-Study (FWS) Program, which provides part-time jobs for undergraduate and graduate students with financial need. These FWS funds will go to 1,179 affected colleges and universities, including 321 postsecondary schools in Florida, Puerto Rico, Texas and the U.S. Virgin Islands. In total, the Department has reallocated $27.9 million to colleges and universities for students participating in the FWS program. The Congress unanimously passed the Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria Education Relief Act of 2017 , which gave the Secretary authority to reallocate previously appropriated campus-based funds. Today&rsquo;s reapportionment is in addition to $10.4 million provided through FWS in December 2017 , and an initial $7.6 million through FSEOG in September 2017 prior to the Relief Act.

It’s important that they, too, are made whole.” Typically, students who were enrolled when a school closes or withdrew not more than 120 days before the school closed can have their federal student loans from that school forgiven if they meet certain requirements. That 120-day window can be extended if the Secretary deems there are exceptional circumstances. Given the atypical circumstances of this closure, the Secretary has extended the window. As a result of the extension, which will be granted to student who withdrew on or after December 31, 2016—or 224 days prior to the school’s closure, nearly a dozen additional students and nearly 300 total student borrowers could now be eligible to have their federal loans forgiven.

ESSA is the bipartisan education legislation passed by Congress in 2015 that returned power over education back to states. DeVos' remarks came after her review and approval of a majority of states' ESSA plans. The law requires a federal review to ensure compliance with the law but then gives latitude to the states to determine how best to ensure educational success. DeVos challenged the chiefs to embrace the flexibility afforded them by ESSA and innovate on behalf of their students. ""Just because a plan complies with the law doesn't mean it does what's best for students,"" said DeVos. The following are highlights of the Secretary's speech: ""Compliant"" Is a Low Bar ""Just because a plan complies with the law doesn't mean it does what's best for students. Whatever the reasons, I see too many plans that only meet the bare minimum required by the law. Sure, they may pass muster around conference tables in Washington, but the bare minimum won't pass muster around kitchen tables."" Multiple Governors Shared Concerns About Plans ""Some of your own governors – Republicans and Democrats -- didn't like your plans either and refused to sign off on them. … ""[One] warned his state's superintendent that ‘adding layers of bureaucratic paperwork does little to help low-performing schools.' … ""[A]nother governor lamented that his state's plan ‘stymies any attempt to hold schools accountable for student performance and includes provisions aimed at preserving the status quo in failing schools.'"" The problem is a systemic culture of prioritizing compliance over creativity ""For too long, many of you have operated – and in many cases, been forced to operate -- as if your work was only accountable to folks in my office. As if all that mattered in education was a sign-off from Washington… My predecessors, from both parties, often fell into the trap of a top-down approach."" The more important judges of plans are students, families and educators ""The imperative to do something shouldn't have to come from Washington. It shouldn't have to come from your state capital. The imperative to do better comes from students. … ""ESSA plans aren't a ceiling. There is no ceiling. There is no ceiling on what students can achieve. These plans merely establish the floor! ""ESSA plans are just words on a page. Let me put it this way: We don't evaluate football teams solely on who has the better game plan on paper. We evaluate them by what happens on the field! The real work of ESSA lies ahead."" There's still the opportunity to innovate and improve ""We must pursue a paradigm shift… a fundamental reorientation... a rethink…. Question everything. At every school. In support of every student's success. …So I ask each of you: What are you going to do to rethink education in your state?"" We can, must and will do better – for students and our future. ""Right now a student is being bullied somewhere for only wanting to read, pay attention to the teacher and learn. Right now a student is being told he can't study a topic for his dream job because the school building doesn't have the teacher or the technology. Right now a student at school is stepping over rats, breathing in mold and dodging fists. … ""That child doesn't care about an ESSA plan. That student's parents don't care about my signature on your piece of paper. They care about what you do…. ""We can act now. We must act now."""

The initial $1,000,000 grant will support recovery efforts at schools in the Broward County Public School system following the school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School that left 17 people dead and 14 others injured on February 14, 2018. ""My heart is broken for the students, teachers and families who have had to endure this unthinkable tragedy,"" said DeVos. ""I am committed to helping identify solutions to prevent another tragedy like this one from happening again. The initial SERV funds awarded today will help Broward County provide services to aid in the healing and recovery process."" DeVos added, ""I have had the honor to meet several members of the Parkland community over the past days. The strength shown by these students, family members and educators is an inspiration to us all."" Project SERV provides critical support to school districts and institutions of higher education that have experienced a significant traumatic event and need resources to restore the learning environment for students and staff. Examples of activities that may be funded by Project SERV include mental health services; overtime for teachers, counselors and security staff; and payment of substitute teachers. Secretary DeVos and Department staff have been in frequent contact with state and local education leaders in Florida over the last two weeks as they assess their needs. Last week at the Department, the Secretary hosted many of the parents, students and educators impacted by the Parkland tragedy and also participated with them in a White House discussion on school safety.

An additional $2.7 billion, authorized by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, will be used to help K-12 school districts and schools as well as institutions of higher education (IHEs) in their recovery efforts. ""The long road to recovery continues, but these funds should provide vital support to schools and institutions to help them return to their full capabilities as quickly and effectively as possible,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""I continue to be inspired every day by the dedication shown by educators, administrators and local leaders to getting students' lives back to normal."" Secretary DeVos has visited each of the hurricane-impacted areas and continues to be in frequent contact with education leaders as they restore their learning environments. In the immediate aftermath of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, the Secretary deployed more than a dozen volunteers as part of the Department of Homeland Security's Surge Capacity Force across Florida, Puerto Rico, Texas and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The Department continues to regularly send staff to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands to provide on-site assistance. The new Federal assistance announced today will allow the Department to launch the following programs: (1)Immediate Aid to Restart School Operations (Restart) Under this program, the Department is authorized to award funds to eligible State educational agencies (SEAs), including those of Alabama, California, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, Texas and U.S. Virgin Islands. These SEAs, in turn, will provide assistance or services to local educational agencies (LEAs), including charter schools, and private schools to help defray expenses related to the restart of operations in, the reopening of, and the re-enrollment of students in elementary and secondary schools that serve an area affected by a covered disaster or emergency. (2) Emergency Impact Aid for Displaced Students Under this program, the Department will award Emergency Impact Aid funding to SEAs, which, in turn, will provide assistance to LEAs for the cost of educating students enrolled in public schools, including charter schools, and private schools, who were displaced by the hurricanes during the school year 2017-2018 and California wildfires in 2017. Congress appropriated a combined amount of approximately $2.5 billion for both the Restart and Emergency Impact Aid for Displaced Student programs. The amounts awarded under each program will be based on demand and specific data received from eligible applicants. (3) Assistance for Homeless Children and Youth Congress appropriated $25 million for additional grants to SEAs for LEAs to address the needs of homeless students displaced by the covered disasters and emergencies. The Department anticipates using data on displaced public school students collected under the Emergency Impact Aid program to make allocations to SEAs under the Assistance for Homeless Children and Youths program. SEAs will award subgrants to LEAs on the basis of demonstrated need. LEAs must use the funds awarded under this program to support activities that are allowable under the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act. (4) Emergency Assistance to Institutions of Higher Education Congress appropriated $100 million for this program, which will provide emergency assistance to IHEs and their students in areas directly affected by the covered disasters or emergencies, for activities authorized under the Higher Education Act of 1965. (5) Defraying Costs of Enrolling Displaced Students in Higher Education Congress appropriated $75 million for this program, which will provide payments to IHEs to help defray the unexpected expenses associated with enrolling displaced students from IHEs directly affected by a covered disaster or emergency, in accordance with criteria to be established and made publicly available. The Department will be sharing additional information soon, including the application packages and technical assistance, on its ""Disaster Relief"" webpage at https://www.ed.gov/disasterrelief .

""This is a great opportunity for local district leaders to put students first,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""Instead of relying on complex federal rules to allocate funds, local leaders can use this flexibility to match funds—local, State or Federal—to the needs of students."" The flexibility will allow school districts to combine eligible Federal funds with State and local funds in order to allocate resources to schools based on the number of students and the corresponding level of need. This type of system, often called ""student-centered funding"" or ""weighted student funding"", is widely considered to be a modern, transparent and quantifiable way to allocate resources to the students most in need. Previously, inflexible rules guiding the allocation and use of Federal funds made it difficult for school districts to create student-centered funding systems using Federal, State and local funds. School districts awarded flexibility will be relieved from Federal funding rules that would otherwise prevent them from implementing a student-centered funding system. ESSA provides for up to fifty school districts to receive the flexibility during the first three years of the program. School districts that receive the flexibility are expected to design and implement a student-centered funding system that meets all statutory requirements of the pilot program, including the use of weights that allocate substantially more funding to students from low-income families, to English learners and to any other educationally disadvantaged student group identified by the school district. School districts that receive the flexibility must also provide an assurance that parents, teachers, school leaders and other relevant stakeholders are consulted in the development and implementation of the student-centered funding system. The application will open on February 7, 2018. For applicants intending to use the flexibility during the 2018-2019 school year, the application is due by March 12, 2018. For applicants intending to use the flexibility during the 2019-2020 school year, the application is due by July 15, 2018. Link: https://www2.ed.gov/policy/elsec/leg/essa/scfp/studentcentered.html Frequently Asked Questions 1. Who may apply? All local educational agencies (LEAs) are eligible to apply. The Department is authorized to award flexibility to 50 LEAs. 2. How do you apply? The application will be available for download from the Department of Education website beginning February 7, 2018. Completed applications can be submitted to weightedfundingpilot@ed.gov . 3. What is being awarded? The program will award flexibility only. It does not include a financial award. 4. When is the application due? For LEAs that indicate on their application that they plan to use the flexibility during the upcoming 2018-2019 school year, the application is due by March 12, 2018. For LEAs that indicate they plan to use the flexibility during the 2019-2020 school year, the application is due by July 15, 2018. For LEAs that will not use the flexibility until the 2019-2020 school year, the time between award and use may be used for planning. 5. When will the flexibility be awarded? The Department intends to award the flexibility on a rolling basis, with those LEAs that apply to use the flexibility during the 2018-2019 school year receiving the earliest award notices. 6. Where can I go for additional information? Prospective applicants can email weightedfundingpilot@ed.gov with questions or comments. Please consult Title I, Part E, Section 1501 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) as amended by the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) for all applicable statutory requirements for participation in the program."

This plan is a direct response to that feedback, and reflects our continued focus on expanding opportunities for Georgia's students."" Hawaii Aligns its state education plan with state strategic planning in order to develop a unified vision for public education in Hawaii inclusive of the state's unique context. Recognizes chronic absenteeism as an early indicator for underperformance and addresses it through inclusion of a chronic absenteeism measure in its accountability system. ""The goals and measures of success outlined in our approved state plan shows Hawaii's continued commitment to providing equitable access to quality education, and empowers our educators to innovate and design schools that meet the needs of their communities,"" said Hawaii State Department of Education Superintendent Dr. Christina Kishimoto. ""This plan is a reflection of the voices of our students, teachers, parents, administrators and community partners that worked together to offer their recommendations on the direction of public education in Hawaii."" Indiana Closes the gap in student achievement in English/language arts and mathematics for all student subgroups by 50 percent by 2023. Uses multiple measures to evaluate the college and career readiness of its high schoolers, such as performance in advanced courses and earning dual credit or an industry certification. For its elementary students, the state plan will measure both student attendance and growth in student attendance over time. ""Today is a great day for Indiana,"" said Indiana Superintendent of Public Instruction Jennifer McCormick. ""Our ESSA plan reflects the input and perspective of many stakeholders in communities across our state. From the beginning, we set out to build a plan that responded to the needs of Hoosier students. From our clear accountability system to our innovative, locally-driven approach to school improvement, our ESSA plan was designed to support student success."" Kansas By 2030, 95 percent of all students will graduate within four years and 75 percent will be proficient in English language arts and mathematics. Kansas will create a system that calculates annual meaningful differentiation for student subgroups, school buildings and school districts using five identified indicators: academic proficiency, performance gaps, English language proficiency, graduation (applicable to high schools only) and student success. ""This is an exciting time of opportunity for education in our state,"" said Kansas Commissioner of Education Randy Watson. ""The Kansas State Board of Education has launched a bold, new vision for education. We are completely changing the way we think about and approach education, and this is reflected in the rigorous goals outlined in Kansas' ESSA plan."" Montana Closes achievement gaps by prioritizing individualized student learning. Enriches professional development opportunities through Montana's online Teacher Learning Hub for administrators and teachers across the state. ""Montana's ESSA plan was created through our state's commitment to local control and community input,"" said Montana Superintendent of Public Instruction Elsie Arntzen. ""We are taking innovative approaches to student success through promoting college and career readiness, and expanding post-secondary pathways to prepare students to be 'Montana Ready.' Focusing on math achievement, STEM, and CTE education beginning at earlier ages and giving local schools flexibility to implement these goals are critical to providing opportunities for ALL Montana students to succeed."" New Hampshire Aligns its state education goals to state workforce goals such that 65 percent of all residents ages 25-64 will attain a postsecondary degree or work-based credential by 2025. Creates college and career readiness indicators for high school recognizing multiple pathways for students, including measuring dual enrollment, performance on national assessments that exceeds a college-ready benchmark, and earning industry recognized credentials, among others. ""I am excited about the approach we have taken in developing our ESSA Consolidated State Plan. This plan includes the excellent work done in our schools, as well as engaging a broad range of community stakeholders in the success of our students,"" said New Hampshire Commissioner of Education Frank Edelblut. We have made a major shift to emphasize growth as a foundational measure. We have also incorporated a broad range of success measures that reflect and respect that students may have different paths toward successful careers."""

This comes after the Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP) at the Department initiated monitoring following reports about the significant decline in the number of children identified as children with disabilities eligible for special education and related services in Texas. The monitoring report lists three specific areas in which TEA failed to comply with Federal law: TEA failed to ensure that all children with disabilities residing in the State who are in need of special education and related services were identified, located and evaluated, regardless of the severity of their disability, as required by IDEA section 612(a)(3) and its implementing regulation at 34 CFR §300.111. TEA failed to ensure that a free appropriate public education (FAPE) was made available to all children with disabilities residing in the State in Texas's mandated age ranges (ages 3 through 21), as required by IDEA section 612(a)(1) and its implementing regulation at 34 CFR §300.101. TEA failed to fulfill its general supervisory and monitoring responsibilities as required by IDEA sections 612(a)(11) and 616(a)(1)(C) and its implementing regulations at 34 CFR §§300.149 and 300.600 and 20 U.S.C. 1232d(b)(3)(A) to ensure that Independent School Districts throughout the State properly implemented the IDEA's child find and FAPE requirements. ""Every child with a disability must have appropriate access to special education and related services that meet his or her unique needs,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. ""Far too many students in Texas had been precluded from receiving supports and services under IDEA. I've worked directly with Commissioner Morath on resolving these issues, and I appreciate the Texas Education Agency's efforts to ensure all children with disabilities are appropriately identified, evaluated and served under IDEA. While there is still more work to be done, leaders in the state have assured me they are committed to ensuring all students with disabilities can achieve their full potential."" In 2004, Texas implemented a special education representation indicator of 8.5 percent to measure the percentage of students enrolled in special education and related services. OSEP found that indicator resulted in a declining identification rate of children with disabilities in Texas. Data from TEA demonstrates the number of children identified as children with disabilities under IDEA declined from the 2003-2004 to 2016-2017 school years by 32,000 students, while total enrollment in Texas schools grew by more than one million students. As early as November of 2016, TEA began taking steps to address initial concerns expressed by OSEP, including issuing a letter to every independent school district in the State reiterating their child find responsibilities under the IDEA. TEA supported OSEP in obtaining necessary information throughout the Department's monitoring, including coordinating a series of listening sessions throughout the State which were attended by both OSEP and TEA staff. Additionally, Governor Abbott, with the Texas legislature, implemented a new law that prohibits the use of school performance indicators that solely measure total number or percentage of enrolled children receiving special education and related services under the IDEA.

Allowing states more flexibility in how they deliver education to students is at the core of ESSA. Each state crafted a plan that it feels will best offer educational opportunities to meet the needs of the state and its students. The following are some of the unique elements from each state's approved plan as highlighted by each state: Minnesota Plans to ensure that by 2020, 90 percent of all students will graduate from high school in four years and that the state aligns its efforts with its workforce development goals. Identifies 25 percent of the lowest-performing schools across three domains—math, reading and English learner proficiency—to ensure all schools in need of support are identified and assisted, with the greatest support directed to the most acutely low-performing schools. “Nothing is more important to Minnesotans than making sure every child has access to a great education,” said Minnesota Commissioner of Education Brenda Cassellius. “That consensus was shared by a broad majority of parents, community members and stakeholders across our state who made equity and ambitious goals the central tenants of our ESSA plan. Together, we created a shared definition of equity that serves as the foundation for a plan that is actionable, research-based and rooted in the best practices for supporting schools. Combined with rigorous accountability expectations, strategic support for schools that need it most, and the promise of easy-to-understand and transparent reporting for teachers, parents, and the public, this plan is a significant step forward in our shared vision for all kids. I look forward to implementing our new plan, and supporting every Minnesota educator as they work even harder to ensure every child has the same opportunity to learn, succeed and thrive.” West Virginia Plans to reduce the number of non-proficient students, overall and for each subgroup, in half by 2030. Provides LEAs access to evidence-based interventions and professional development based on performance on individual indicators within the Statewide Accountability System, so that any school struggling with a single indicator receives support. “The intent of our ESSA plan is to be a catalyst for economic growth and development in West Virginia. Our goal is to ensure that every student is provided the opportunity to be successful after graduating high school in their chosen career and/or post-secondary endeavors. Our comprehensive system will individualize support and capitalize on a network of education partnerships, while supporting Gov. Jim Justice’s focus on education and economic development,” said Steven Paine, West Virginia’s state superintendent of schools."
20-Dec-17,https://web.archive.org/web/20210108025343/https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/improved-borrower-defense-discharge-process-will-aid-defrauded-borrowers-protect-taxpayers,"Improved Borrower Defense Discharge Process Will Aid Defrauded Borrowers, Protect Taxpayers","WASHINGTON – After careful review to ensure a fair and efficient process, the U.S. Department of Education (the Department) today unveiled an improved discharge process for borrower defense to repayment (BDR) claims. ""We have been working to get this right for students since day one,"" said Secretary Betsy DeVos. ""No fraud is acceptable, and students deserve relief if the school they attended acted dishonestly. This improved process will allow claims to be adjudicated quickly and harmed students to be treated fairly. It also protects taxpayers from being forced to shoulder massive costs that may be unjustified."" For pending claims, no changes were made to the existing approval criteria. Claims that previously would have been approved will still be approved today. However, rather than taking an ""all or nothing"" approach to discharge, the improved process will provide tiers of relief to compensate former Corinthian students based on damages incurred. NEW PROCESS FAIRLY COMPENSATES FOR DAMAGES Students whose current earnings are less than 50 percent of their peers from a passing gainful employment (GE) program will receive full relief. Students whose earnings are at 50 percent or more of their GE program peers will receive proportionally tiered relief to compensate for the difference and make them whole (Table 1). Table 1 CCI Earnings as a Percentage of GE Earnings Amount of Relief 1% to 49% 100% 50% to 59% 50% 60% to 69% 40% 70% to 79% 30% 80% to 89% 20% 90% and above 10% In all calculations, rounding is done to the benefit of the student, including: Relief is rounded up by tenths. For example, if a student had 59 percent of a passing GE program earnings, the student would receive 50 percent BDR relief. The better of mean or median earnings as compared to GE program peers is used to calculate relief. If the student was enrolled in multiple programs, the program which yields the most relief is the program used in the calculation. Additionally, to mitigate the inconvenience for how long it has taken to adjudicate claims, the Department will apply a credit to interest that accrues on loans starting one year after the borrower defense application is filed. The principle of relief based on value of education received is consistent with the legal authorization of BDR under the Higher Education Act and the existing BDR regulation, 34 CFR 685.206 [C][2], adopted in the Clinton Administration. Similar concepts for partial relief were proposed by the Obama Administration in its October 2016 regulation. RESPONDS TO CONCERNS RAISED BY INSPECTOR GENERAL Following an internal review, the Secretary was concerned that there was no standardized process in place. In May, Secretary DeVos requested the Education Inspector General (IG) look into the existing procedures for claim adjudication. The IG found ""weaknesses with FSA's procedures for: 1. documenting the review and approval of legal memoranda establishing categories of borrower defense claims that qualified for discharge; 2. reviewing borrower defense claims; 3. processing claims approved for loan discharge and flagged for denial; and 4. establishing timeframes for claims intake, claims review, loan discharge, and claims denial processes and controls to ensure timeframes are met."" The Department has worked diligently to address the issues cited, yielding the improved discharge process. ACTION TAKEN TODAY The Department has approved for discharge 12,900 pending claims submitted by former Corinthian Colleges, Inc. students, and 8,600 pending claims have been denied. This action includes claims that have been received during this administration. Many of the denied claims were identified for denial, but not acted on, by the prior administration. Borrowers will be notified on a rolling basis as their discharge is finalized. The remaining pending claims will be adjudicated systematically under the newly announced discharge process. CONTINUING TO IMPROVE BORROWER DEFENSE The borrower defense to repayment regulation currently is under negotiated rulemaking, which began Nov. 13. As Secretary DeVos stated when she announced the Department's regulatory reset on June 14, 2017, the previous regulatory process yielded a ""muddled process that's unfair to students and schools and puts taxpayers on the hook for significant costs."" She continued, ""It is the Department's aim, and this Administration's commitment, to protect students from predatory practices while also providing clear, fair and balanced rules for colleges and universities to follow."" The negotiators will continue to work toward a new regulation that will treat students, institutions and taxpayers fairly."

The Federal Work-Study (FWS) Program funds will be distributed to schools located in Federal Emergency Management Agency-declared major disaster areas impacted by hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, as well as schools across the nation that have enrolled a significant number of students from the impacted areas. ""Today's announcement is part of the Department's ongoing efforts to provide support, flexibility and assistance to students whose lives were turned upside down by recent natural disasters,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""It is important that they are able to resume normal activities as quickly as possible, and that these funds go to those who are most in need."" FWS provides part-time jobs for undergraduate and graduate students with financial need, allowing them to earn money to help pay education expenses. The program encourages community service work and work related to the student's course of study. Legislation passed in the wake of the devastating storms—the Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria Education Relief Act of 2017 —provided the flexibility for the Department to award the supplemental funds to impacted schools, as well as impacted students. As part of broad hurricane relief efforts, in September, Secretary DeVos announced new non-regulatory guidance that continues to provide support to state and location educational agencies, postsecondary institutions and other Department grantees and program participants. In total, the Department contacted and supported more than 1,400 impacted postsecondary institutions across the southern U.S. and the Caribbean."

To an audience of more than five thousand financial aid professionals from around the world, Dr. A. Wayne Johnson, chief operating officer of the Department's office of Federal Student Aid (FSA), announced the blueprint for FSA's Next Generation (Next Gen) Financial Services Environment. This new approach will modernize the technology and operational components that support federal student aid programs from application through repayment. Students, parents and borrowers will begin seeing meaningful improvements in the customer experience in early 2018 with significant technology and operational infrastructure changes throughout 2019. ""This overhaul is long overdue,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""Students and their families should be treated like the valued customers they are and should have access to the tools needed for success. Today's announcement is a significant first step in our commitment to improving the experiences students, parents and borrowers have with FSA and in bringing federal student aid programs into the 21st century."" In spring 2018, FSA will launch its mobile platform, which will allow students and parents to complete and submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA®) form on a mobile phone. In fall 2018, fafsa.gov will be integrated into StudentAid.gov , making it easier than ever to apply for financial aid directly from FSA's leading online portal. This integration also will allow FAFSA applicants to switch seamlessly between mobile and web, enabling students and their families to apply for financial aid wherever they are and on the device of their choice. Eventually, FSA will consolidate all of its customer-facing websites into a single, integrated and user-friendly online platform to provide students, parents and borrowers a consistent and seamless experience from application through repayment. To address future loan servicing needs, FSA is in the process of researching how world-class financial services organizations design and operationalize their customer service engagement practices, as well as web and mobile, middleware, data processing, analytics, storage and hosting capabilities. Through this market research, FSA is refining its strategy to implement the Next Gen Processing and Servicing Environment. ""The Next Gen Financial Services Environment will mark a new milestone in the evolution of federal student aid,"" said Dr. Johnson. ""FSA's more than 40 million customers deserve a world-class experience. Without question, the future of FSA is upon us."" FSA anticipates issuing one or more solicitations in the first quarter of 2018 focused on account processing and loan servicing.

Each item has been either superseded by current law or is no longer in effect. Removing these out-of-date materials will make it easier for schools, educators, parents and the public to understand what guidance is still in effect. Appointed on April 25, 2017, the Department's Regulatory Reform Task Force, composed of career and non-career employees, has analyzed Department regulations and policy guidance for possible repeal, modification or replacement over the last six months. As part of this review, which involved attorneys from the Department's Office of General Counsel, the Task Force identified hundreds of subregulatory documents that are ready for withdrawal due to being superseded by current law or simply out-of-date. As part of its review, the Task Force has directed Principal Offices in the Department to conduct stakeholder outreach to solicit input on regulations and guidance that are ready for repeal, replacement or modification. The Department also sought public input through a request for comments in the Federal Register and received 16,391 comments by the time the 90 day comment period closed on September 20, 2017. These comments are currently under study by the Task Force. Office of Elementary and Secondary Education (OESE) Outreach : U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos convened a listening session on October 2, 2017, with education policy and thought leaders who individually presented views on the topic of regulatory relief for State educational agencies, local school districts, schools, teachers and administrators. The Department also sought and received input from a cross-section of stakeholder groups including, but not limited to, The School Superintendents Association, Council of Chief State School Officers, Council of the Great City Schools, Education Trust, Interstate Migrant Education Council, National Alliance for Public Charter Schools, National Association of State Boards of Education, National Association of Federally Impacted Schools, National Governors Association, National Indian Education Association, National Indian Impacted Schools Association, National Title I Association, and United Parent Leaders Action Network. Action: From 228 guidance documents, OESE has identified 97 out-of-date guidance documents for withdrawal. Examples of OESE guidance documents being withdrawn include those relating to the 1994 amendments to the ESEA (Cross-Cutting Guidance to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act), to long ago appropriations (Guidance on the FY 2000 Appropriation for School Improvement), to grant programs that no longer exist (Gulf Coast Recovery Grant Initiative), and to policy letters to States under NCLB (NCLB Policy Letters to States—Use of Funds for Districts and Schools Identified for School Improvement). Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS) Outreach : OSERS hosted more than 1,000 people at its Annual Leadership Conference on July 17-19, 2017, where attendees were provided three opportunities to provide feedback on the regulatory reform process. On September 11, 2017, OSERS conduced an on-site meeting with more than 60 organizations representing parents, disability advocates, civil rights groups and education associations. During monthly and quarterly phone calls, OSERS also alerted State Directors of Special Education, State Part C Coordinators for Early Intervention, and members of the Council of State Administrators for Vocational Rehabilitation to the opportunity to submit comments on regulatory reform. OSERS also conducted a stakeholders call open to the public on October 24, 2017, concerning the superseded, out-of-date guidance that it intends to withdraw. Action: Out of 169 documents, OSERS identified 72 out-of-date guidance documents for withdrawal. Examples include guidance going back to the early 1980s, such as OSEP's Informal Letter to Chief State School Officers on Data Submissions Due During FY 1983 or those superseded by statute or regulation (like OSEP’s May 4, 2000 Memo 00-14 Qs & As on Obligations of Public Agencies Serving Children with Disabilities Placed by their Parents in Private Schools). Office of Postsecondary Education (OPE) Outreach : OPE held two public hearings (at Salt Lake Community College in Sandy, UT, on September 26 and at the Department of Education, Washington, DC, on October 4). Action : Out of 1,171 documents, OPE has identified 398 out-of-date guidance documents for withdrawal. OPE will archive these materials in the coming months. Examples include many guidance documents dating back to 1994, such as those relating to closed invitations for Experimental Site Initiatives (such as GEN 13-21, Invitation to Participate in the Experimental Sites Initiative) and historical occurrences, like the flooding that occurred in 1997 in North Dakota, South Dakota and Minnesota. The Office of Career, Technical, and Adult Education, the Office of Innovation and Improvement, and the Office of the Chief Financial Officer conducted similar outreach efforts and are also withdrawing out-of-date guidance documents.

Nearly 238,000 online applications were submitted the first day, representing an eight percent increase compared to one year ago. Most students and parents are eligible to use the IRS DRT to electronically transfer their 2016 tax return information. The tool returned Oct. 1 for the 2018‒19 FAFSA with extra security and privacy protections to safeguard sensitive taxpayer data. Each year, more than 20 million FAFSAs are submitted, resulting in more than $120 billion in federal grants, loans and work-study funds to help pay for college or career school. “Our vision at the U.S. Department of Education (ED) is that every eligible student in the nation completes the FAFSA,” said Dr. A. Wayne Johnson, chief operating officer of ED’s office of Federal Student Aid. “Filling out the FAFSA is free, and Federal Student Aid provides a wealth of resources to assist students and parents every step of the way.” Students who plan to submit the FAFSA online should create an FSA ID as soon as possible at StudentAid.gov/fsaid . If a student is considered dependent for FAFSA purposes, one of the student’s parents also needs to create an FSA ID in order to sign the FAFSA online. Each person must create his or her own FSA ID to avoid issues and delays with the financial aid process. Once the FAFSA is processed, the school will use the FAFSA information to calculate the amounts and types of financial aid the student may qualify for, and the school will send the student a financial aid offer. Financial aid offers come from schools, not the U.S. Department of Education, and each school has its own schedule for awarding financial aid. Students are encouraged to complete the FAFSA as soon as possible to take advantage of any early state and school financial aid deadlines. ### StudentAid.gov, Federal Student Aid’s primary online portal for students and parents has information about completing the FAFSA , as well as frequently asked questions about the IRS DRT returning for the 2018-19 FAFSA .

The recognition is based on a school's overall academic performance or progress in closing achievement gaps among student subgroups. ""National Blue Ribbon Schools are active demonstrations of preparing every child for a bright future,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos to the honorees. ""You are visionaries, innovators and leaders. You have much to teach us: some of you personalize student learning, others engage parents and communities in the work and life of your local schools and still others develop strong and forward-thinking leaders from among your teaching staff."" The National Blue Ribbon Schools Program honors public and private elementary, middle and high schools where students achieve very high learning standards or are making notable improvements in closing the achievement gap. This coveted award affirms the hard work of educators, families and communities in creating safe and welcoming schools where students master challenging and engaging content. Now in its 35th year, the National Blue Ribbon Schools Program has bestowed recognition on more than 8,500 schools. On Nov. 6-7, the Secretary and the Department of Education will celebrate with these honorees at an awards ceremony in Washington, D.C. All schools are honored in one of two performance categories, based on all student scores, subgroup student scores and graduation rates: Exemplary High Performing Schools are among their state's highest performing schools as measured by state assessments or nationally normed tests. Exemplary Achievement Gap Closing Schools are among their state's highest performing schools in closing achievement gaps between a school's subgroups and all students over the past five years. Up to 420 schools may be nominated each year. The Department invites National Blue Ribbon School nominations from the top education official in all states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the Department of Defense Education Activity and the Bureau of Indian Education. Private schools are nominated by The Council for American Private Education (CAPE).

This year’s slate includes five new members and one reappointment, with terms beginning Oct. 1, 2017, and ending Sept. 30, 2021. The appointees will help set policy for the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) , also known as the Nation’s Report Card. NAEP offers to the public and to education policymakers at the national, state and local levels, objective data on student performance in nearly a dozen subjects. The information NAEP provides helps education stakeholders evaluate the progress of American education. The 26-member nonpartisan, independent Governing Board determines the subjects and content of NAEP tests, sets the achievement levels for reporting and publicly releases the results. “It’s a privilege to have these accomplished leaders with such diverse backgrounds agree to oversee NAEP,” Secretary DeVos said. “The board plays an important role in assessing student achievement, and these members’ perspectives will be critical as we work to close the achievement gap and ensure all students have equal access to a great education. I am also thrilled that Gov. Engler has agreed to serve as board chair. He is a tireless advocate for all of our nation’s students, and his strong leadership will be a substantial asset to the board.” The new and reappointed Governing Board members, along with the roles they represent, are listed below: Dana Boyd (El Paso, Texas, elementary school principal). Since 2010, Boyd has served as principal of East Point Elementary School, Ysleta Independent School District, in El Paso, Texas, where she previously served as a teacher and assistant principal. Boyd was chosen as the 2007 Texas Teacher of the Year. Her other honors include 2016 Texas National Distinguished Principal of the Year and a 2017 Hall of Fame inductee into the El Paso Commission for Women. A member and nominee of the National Association of Elementary School Principals, Boyd’s efforts at East Point include the development of professional learning communities and the use of data in implementing needed interventions and enrichment. Gregory J. Cizek (Chapel Hill, North Carolina, testing and measurement expert). Cizek is the Guy B. Phillips Distinguished Professor of Educational Measurement and Evaluation at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. Cizek’s early career included work in K-12 education as an elementary and middle school teacher, and an elected local school board member. He was also certified as an elementary principal. His academic career has spanned 25 years in the field of applied assessment with specializations in standard setting, validity and test security. Cizek has served as president of the National Council on Measurement in Education. He previously served a partial term on the Governing Board. Tyler Cramer (San Diego, general public representative). Cramer previously served as a member of the Governing Board’s Business Policy Task Force, which lent the business perspective to the Board on policies that affected NAEP. Other significant experiences include serving as the chair of the San Diego Business Roundtable for Education, education committee chair of the San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce (where he also was director), and member of the California Longitudinal Pupil Achievement Data System Advisory Board. He has also served on, chaired or been the parent representative on various San Diego City Schools committees. Cramer, an industry counsel and executive, was a member of the University of San Diego’s Center for Education Policy and Law advisory board, which fosters better linkage between educational research, policymaking and practice. Honorable John Engler (McLean, Virginia, Republican governor, general public representative). Gov. Engler recently retired as president of the Business Roundtable , a group of nearly 200 chief executives of major U.S. corporations that collectively employ more than 15 million people. Previously, he was president and CEO of the National Association of Manufacturers in Washington, D.C. Gov. Engler is a former Governing Board member and a member of the NAEP 12th Grade Preparedness Task Force. He served as the 46th governor of Michigan, from 1991 to 2003, and previously served in the state legislature for 20 years, including seven years as state Senate majority leader. Honorable James Geringer (Cheyenne, Wyoming, Republican governor). Re-appointee Gov. Geringer currently serves on the Board’s Committee on Standards, Design and Methodology. He was the 30th governor of Wyoming, from 1995 to 2003, and previously served in the Wyoming Legislature from 1983 to 1994. Gov. Geringer is a veteran of the U.S. Air Force where he worked in partnership with NASA on aerospace programs. He is one of the founding governors of Western Governors University, a private and non-profit online university, and is currently chairman of its Board of Trustees. His leadership also includes involvement in the National Commission on Mathematics and Science Teaching for the 21st century, the National Research Council at the National Academies and the Education Commission of the States. He joined the Environmental Systems Research Institute in 2003 as director of policy and public sector strategies. Honorable Beverly Perdue (New Bern, North Carolina, Democratic governor). Gov. Perdue began her career as a public school teacher and then directed geriatric services at a community hospital. Her political career began in the North Carolina House of Representatives, and she went on to serve five terms in the North Carolina Senate before she was elected as the 32nd Lieutenant Governor. She then became the 73rd governor of North Carolina, from 2009 to 2013, the state’s first female chief executive. After she left office, Gov. Perdue initiated many education efforts, including founding and chairing DigiLEARN, a non-profit institution designed to accelerate digital learning opportunities for all ages. She also served as a Resident Fellow at the Harvard Institute of Politics and a Distinguished Visiting Fellow at Duke University’s Sanford School of Public Policy. These members take office as the Governing Board is fulfilling several areas of its strategic vision, which calls for developing strategic partnerships to disseminate NAEP data and resources, and advancing the content, design and reporting.

The rate increased slightly from 11.3 percent to 11.5 percent for students who entered repayment between fiscal years 2013 and 2014. During the tracking period for the FY 2014 borrower cohort (Oct. 1, 2013 to Sept. 30, 2016), more than five million borrowers entered repayment, and 580,671 of them—or 11.5 percent—defaulted on their loans. Those borrowers attended 6,173 postsecondary institutions across the nation. Over the past five years, the rate has decreased 3.2 percentage points from a high of 14.7 percent to 11.5 percent today. The FY 2014 cohort default rate is the percentage of a school’s borrowers who entered repayment on Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program or William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan (Direct Loan) Program loans between Oct. 1, 2013 and Sept. 30, 2014 and subsequently defaulted prior to Sept. 30, 2016. Visit the default management website for information about the national student loan default rate, as well as rates for individual schools, states, types of postsecondary institutions and other details. Resources to Help Borrowers Manage Student Loan Debt The Department is committed to helping borrowers successfully manage their federal student loan debt by providing a wealth of information and resources, including how to find an affordable repayment plan, at StudentAid.gov/repay . Additionally, the Department communicates to borrowers through email outreach campaigns and offers loan counseling that allows borrowers the ability to select their repayment plan based on their individual circumstances during exit counseling. Sanctions Schools with high default rates may lose their eligibility to participate in or expand their federal student aid programs. This year, seven proprietary schools, two public, and one private institution are subject to loss of eligibility for default rates that either were 30 percent or greater for three consecutive years or were more than 40 percent for the latest year, or both. Those schools include: IL – Chicago – Larry's Barber College KY – Cumberland – Southeast Kentucky Community and Technical College ND – Bismarck – United Tribes Technical College ND – Minot – Headquarters Academy of Hair Design NY – Hempstead–Long Island Barber Institute (The) OH – Columbus – Daymar College SC – Walterboro – Cosmetics Arts Institute TN – Madison – Nashville Barber and Style Academy TX – Houston – Jay's Technical Institute VA – Culpeper – Culpeper Cosmetology Training Center The Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008 amended the law to require that, starting in 2014, sanctions against institutions with high cohort default rates would be based on the three-year cohort default rates. All institutions with a default rate that is equal to or greater than 30 percent must establish a default prevention task force that prepares a plan to identify the factors causing the school's cohort default rate to exceed 30 percent and submit the plan to the Department. The Department's office of Federal Student Aid (FSA) provides extensive assistance to higher education institutions, including webinars and online training; state, regional and national association training forums, and face-to-face training events.

""This interim guidance will help schools as they work to combat sexual misconduct and will treat all students fairly,"" said DeVos. ""Schools must continue to confront these horrific crimes and behaviors head-on. There will be no more sweeping them under the rug. But the process also must be fair and impartial, giving everyone more confidence in its outcomes."" In the coming months, the Department intends to engage in rulemaking on Title IX responsibilities arising from complaints of sexual misconduct. The Department will solicit comments from stakeholders and the public during the rulemaking process, a legal procedure the prior administration ignored. In the interim, the newly-released Q&A; on Campus Sexual Misconduct explains the Department's current expectations of schools, and the Department will continue to rely on its Revised Sexual Harassment Guidance, which was informed by a public comment process and issued in 2001, as well as the Dear Colleague Letter on Sexual Harassment issued on January 25, 2006. ""In the coming months, hearing from survivors, campus administrators, parents, students and experts on sexual misconduct will be vital as we work to create a thoughtful rule that will benefit students for years to come. We also will continue to work with schools and community leaders to better address preventing sexual misconduct through education and early intervention,"" DeVos added. The Department of Education is also withdrawing the Dear Colleague Letter on Sexual Violence dated April 4, 2011, and the Questions and Answers on Title IX Sexual Violence dated April 29, 2014. The withdrawn documents ignored notice and comment requirements, created a system that lacked basic elements of due process and failed to ensure fundamental fairness. DeVos concluded, ""As I said earlier this month, the era of rule by letter is over. The Department of Education will follow the proper legal procedures to craft a new Title IX regulation that better serves students and schools."" Press Call Information: The Department will hold a background press call at 10:45 a.m. open to credentialed members of the media. Media interested in participating should RSVP to press@ed.gov to receive additional information. FAQs on Updated Campus Sexual Misconduct Guidance What is the purpose of the Q&A; on Campus Sexual Misconduct? Describes a school's responsibility to address sexual misconduct complaints Discusses the relationship between Title IX and the Clery Act Provides examples of interim measures that may be appropriate under the circumstances Summarizes what procedures a school should follow to adjudicate a finding of responsibility for sexual misconduct Describes what constitutes an ""equitable"" investigation Explains a school's obligations concerning appeals Clarifies appropriate evidentiary standards Informs schools of their responsibilities concerning notifications to parties of the outcomes of disciplinary proceedings What are a school's obligations under Title IX regarding sexual misconduct? Schools must address sexual misconduct that is severe, persistent or pervasive. Schools must conduct a fair and impartial investigation in a timely manner. Title IX investigations must be led by a person free of actual or reasonably perceived conflicts of interest and biases. Schools must designate a Title IX Coordinator. Do schools have flexibility to establish fair procedures? Schools have the discretion to apply either the preponderance of the evidence standard or the clear and convincing evidence standard. Schools are not required to allow appeals; however, a school may choose to allow appeals solely by the responding party or by both parties. Schools may permit an informal resolution, such as mediation, if it is appropriate and if all parties voluntarily agree. Schools should provide written notice to the responding party of the allegations, including sufficient details and with adequate time to prepare a response before any initial interview. OCR recommends schools provide concurrent, written notice of the outcome of disciplinary proceedings to the reporting and responding parties. Does the rescission letter or the Q&A; add legal requirements? The rescission letter and Q&A; do not add requirements to applicable law. Does the rescission letter or the Q&A; limit the right of a person to file a Title IX complaint? No. A school must adopt and publish grievance procedures that provide for a prompt and equitable resolution of complaints of sex discrimination, including sexual misconduct. Moreover, whether or not a student files a complaint of alleged sexual misconduct or otherwise asks the school to take action, where the school knows or reasonably should know of an incident of sexual misconduct, the school must take steps to understand what occurred and to respond appropriately. In particular, when sexual misconduct is so severe, persistent or pervasive as to deny or limit a student's ability to participate in or benefit from the recipient's school's programs or activities, a hostile environment exists and the school must respond. How can I get help from OCR? OCR offers technical assistance to help schools achieve voluntary compliance with the civil rights laws it enforces and works with schools to develop approaches to preventing and addressing discrimination. A school should contact the OCR enforcement office serving its jurisdiction for technical assistance. Telephone: 800-421-3481 FAX: 202-453-6012; TDD: 800-877-8339 Email: OCR@ed.gov"

""I continue to be heartened by the ways in which states have embraced the flexibility afforded to them under ESSA,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""I want to thank Acting Commissioner Jeff Wulfson, Governor Charlie Baker and all the stakeholders that contributed to Massachusetts' plan. This plan also serves as a testament to the leadership of the late Commissioner Mitchell Chester, who remains greatly missed. I look forward to seeing how these words on paper translate to classroom action that meets the unique needs of the students across the commonwealth."" Allowing states more flexibility in how they deliver education to students is at the core of ESSA. Each state crafted a plan that it feels will best offer educational opportunities to meet the needs of the state and its students. The following are some of the unique elements from Massachusetts' plan: Champions strategies to help transform the lowest-performing schools and districts which includes state and local partnerships, empowering school and district innovation and bold intervention authority. Measures the percentage of juniors and seniors in high school who complete broad and challenging coursework—including Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate and honors courses—in order to incentivize participation in rigorous coursework and to reduce equity gaps among student subgroups enrolled in advanced courses. ""Massachusetts is proud of the achievements of our K-12 student population, but like most other states, we still have a lot of work ahead to close persistent achievement gaps,"" said Commissioner Jeff Wulfson. “""Our ESSA state plan provides a framework for accountability and targeted assistance and builds on a system that has helped improve schools for Massachusetts students. We appreciate the support we've received from Secretary DeVos and her staff and look forward to working in partnership with them."""

Project SERV grants support activities and services that enable schools to restore the learning environment after a natural or man-made disaster. OESE will be conducting a webinar on Sept. 19 in collaboration with FEMA on its Public Assistance Program. The Public Assistance Program provides supplemental federal disaster grant assistance for debris removal, life-saving emergency protective measures, and the repair, replacement or restoration of disaster-damaged publicly-owned facilities. OESE is working with its Federal partners and reaching out to State educational agencies in localities impacted by Hurricane Irma to understand the nature and scope of the damage that Irma has inflicted on their educational institutions. The Department's Office of Innovation and Improvement (OII) has contacted charter schools or their representatives in state affected by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma regarding their emerging needs. These states are still assessing damage, and the Department expects to provide technical assistance and support as needed in the coming weeks. OII has contacted the major private school associations in Puerto Rico, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and Kentucky via email, in addition to the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops for their VI schools, to receive updates on the status of their schools in Irma-impacted areas. OII will send a message to all hurricane-impacted areas on Sept. 12 regarding the upcoming ED/FEMA Public Assistance webinar on Sept. 19, 2017. Office of the Inspector General On Sept. 10, a team of 10 agents from the Office of the Inspector General arrived at a staging area at Moody Air Force Base, Georgia, as part of a quick response team in support of the Federal government's Emergency Support Function #13 (Public Safety and Security) for Hurricane Irma. They have been assigned to provide security for a Disaster Medical Assistance Team (DMAT) in the Florida Keys.

7-Sep-17,https://web.archive.org/web/20210108025343/https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/highlights-secretary-devos-remarks-title-ix-enforcement,Highlights from Secretary DeVos' Remarks on Title IX Enforcement,"Washington — U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos today discussed a better way forward on Title IX enforcement with students and faculty at George Mason University. In her remarks, the Secretary laid out the problems with the current failed system and the need to establish a regulatory framework that serves all students. The following are key excerpts from the Secretary's prepared remarks: Let me be clear at the outset: acts of sexual misconduct are reprehensible, disgusting, and unacceptable. They are acts of cowardice and personal weakness, often thinly disguised as strength and power. ... One assault is one too many. One aggressive act of harassment is one too many. One person denied due process is one too many. ... There is no way to avoid the devastating reality of campus sexual misconduct: lives have been lost. Lives of victims. And lives of the accused. ... We need to remember that we're not just talking about faceless ""cases."" We are talking about people's lives. Everything we do must recognize this before anything else. ... [T]he truth is that the system established by the prior administration has failed too many students. Survivors, victims of a lack of due process and campus administrators have all told me that the current approach does a disservice to everyone involved. The current failed system left one student to fend for herself at a university disciplinary hearing. Without any legal training whatsoever, she had to prepare an opening statement, fix exhibits and find witnesses. ""I don't think it's the rape that makes the person a victim,"" the student told a reporter. She said it is the failure of the system that turns a survivor into a victim. ... Washington's push to require schools to establish these quasi-legal structures to address sexual misconduct comes up short for far too many students. The current system hasn't won widespread support, nor has it inspired confidence in its so-called judgments. ... Survivors aren't well-served when they are re-traumatized with appeal after appeal because the failed system failed the accused. And no student should be forced to sue their way to due process. ... For too long, rather than engage the public on controversial issues, the Department's Office for Civil Rights has issued letters from the desks of un-elected and un-accountable political appointees. ... Instead of working with schools on behalf of students, the prior administration weaponized the Office for Civil Rights to work against schools and against students. ... The era of ""rule by letter"" is over. Through intimidation and coercion, the failed system has clearly pushed schools to overreach. With the heavy hand of Washington tipping the balance of her scale, the sad reality is that Lady Justice is not blind on campuses today. ... Every survivor of sexual misconduct must be taken seriously. Every student accused of sexual misconduct must know that guilt is not predetermined. These are non-negotiable principles. ... A better way means that due process is not an abstract legal principle only discussed in lecture halls. Due process is the foundation of any system of justice that seeks a fair outcome. Due process either protects everyone, or it protects no one. The notion that a school must diminish due process rights to better serve the ""victim"" only creates more victims. ... In order to ensure that America's schools employ clear, equitable, just and fair procedures that inspire trust and confidence, we will launch a notice-and-comment process to incorporate the insights of all parties in developing a better way. We will seek public feedback and combine institutional knowledge, professional expertise and the experiences of students to replace the current approach with a workable, effective and fair system. ... This is not about letting institutions off the hook. They still have important work to do. A survivor told me that she is tired of feeling like the burden of ensuring her school addresses Title IX falls on her shoulders. She is right. The burden is not hers, nor is it any student's burden. ... The truth is: we must do better... for each other and with each other. Full text of the Secretary's remarks will be posted shortly after the conclusion of the speech on https://www.ed.gov/news/speeches"

Each state crafted a plan that it feels will best offer educational opportunities to meet the needs of the state and its students. The following are some of the unique elements from Arizona’s plan: Allows elementary and middle schools to earn additional points in its accountability system for accelerating student achievement, including increasing student performance in math, decreasing the number of minimally proficient students, improving the performance of certain student subgroups and/or using an inclusion model for special education. Allows high schools to earn additional points in its accountability system for preparing students to be college and career ready, including students performing well in CTE courses, passing college-level courses, earning an industry credential and/or completing a work-based learning internship, among others."

They are available at https://ifap.ed.gov/dpcletters/GEN1708.html Federal Student Aid (FSA) set up a responsive team to manage the correspondence, emails, calls and other inquiries received from institutions. A database was developed to track and manage all contacts with schools and document any support needed to resolve claims/questions from impacted schools. General information for students and parents about disaster assistance was posted at StudentAid.gov/hurricane-harvey . The Department directed federal student loan servicers to provide impacted borrowers flexibility in managing their loan payments during this time. Borrowers can contact their student loan servicer for more information or call 1-800-4FED-AID (1-800-433-3243) to find out their servicer's contact information.

FSA is an office within the U.S. Department of Education. ""Protecting students has always been my top priority,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""This new approach will enhance our efforts on our oversight responsibilities, including enforcement against bad actors, such as illegitimate debt relief organizations, schools defrauding students and institutions willfully ignoring their Clery Act responsibilities."" Dr. A. Wayne Johnson, the new chief operating officer at FSA, recently began transforming the oversight function—broadening its scope, increasing its capacity and adopting a more sophisticated strategy—while adding several key senior executives to help lead and implement a more comprehensive, broader approach to the oversight of the federal student aid programs. ""FSA recognizes that there are many quality institutions that participate in the Federal student aid programs, along with many third-party service providers that are committed to effectively administering and operating the programs,"" said Dr. Johnson. ""But FSA has an obligation to ensure that any organization affiliated with these programs understands its responsibilities and complies with Federal student aid statutes, regulations and other related consumer protection laws."" ""We will not allow bad actors to harm students, parents, borrowers and taxpayers,"" Dr. Johnson continued. ""We will enforce what is right for students at every turn of their student aid life cycle, regardless of whether they are applying for, receiving or repaying aid."" Under Dr. Johnson's direction, FSA has established an integrated system of complementary oversight functions to ensure compliance by all participating parties. Under this approach, oversight begins with proactive risk management to identify and mitigate risks before they pose a threat. These efforts are bolstered by comprehensive communications and executive outreach to ensure parties and their leadership understand their responsibilities, the consequences of non-compliance and appropriate remedies. ""We have amplified our outreach to program participants to ensure they understand these rules and their status,"" said Dr. Johnson. ""If we determine parties are out of compliance, we will use the authority delegated to the Secretary—and in turn to Federal Student Aid—to do right by students, borrowers and taxpayers, including bringing them into compliance or, if necessary, revoking their eligibility to participate in the student aid programs."" To support this work, FSA has added several new leaders across the organization in the areas of enforcement, outreach, communications, and risk management who bring a wealth of expertise to FSA and augment the experienced and committed staff already in place. Dr. Michael Dean is joining FSA as the chief enterprise risk officer. He will lead the team that proactively identifies, assesses and monitors risks enterprise-wide, including fraud-, cybersecurity- and compliance-related risks. Dr. Dean's team works with senior leaders across FSA to effectively manage risks in order to fulfill FSA's mission. The critical work of FSA's compliance office will continue to be led by career veteran Chief Compliance Officer Robin Minor . Her team of nearly 400 oversight professionals monitors schools' and other financial institutions' compliance with Title IV laws and regulations. The compliance group conducts hundreds of institutional program reviews, resolves audits and performs other activities each year. The team will be working to communicate more frequently and proactively with schools and other institutions to enable these organizations to more quickly learn of the status of reviews and audit resolutions, as well as address any identified deficiencies more efficiently. Dr. Charles Patterson is joining FSA as the senior advisor for executive-level compliance and enforcement outreach. He will focus on communications with leaders at colleges and universities, as well as on outreach to university systems; higher education organizations; and other federal, state and local stakeholders with a shared interest in protecting students, parents, and borrowers. Dr. Julian Schmoke, Jr. is joining FSA to lead enforcement activities. In addition to a track record of successfully advocating for students for more than 20 years, he brings experience in higher education leadership, instruction and accreditation, including serving in an academic capacity at DeVry University, where he ensured the delivery of a quality education to students. Dr. Schmoke will lead a team focused on identifying, investigating and adjudicating statutory and regulatory violations of the federal student aid programs and on resolving borrower defense claims. Additionally, the team led by Dr. Schmoke will play a central role in coordinating efforts to prevent third-party companies associated with student aid programs from harming students, parents and borrowers. Chris Greene is returning to FSA to head the communications, outreach and customer experience teams. He brings nearly 20 years of student aid, government and communications experience to the organization and will be responsible for ensuring that FSA's communications infrastructure serves the needs of all stakeholders. FSA will continue to offer in-person and web-based technical assistance to schools and will continue providing information, training and early intervention support directly to financial aid professionals to help schools meet their compliance obligations. FSA's proactive work will continue to be informed by customer input—including, complaints and allegations of suspicious activity through the FSA feedback system, available at StudentAid.gov/feedback —and supported by coordination with other stakeholders, including accrediting bodies, the Federal Trade Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice.

""As more and more state plans come under the Department's review, I am heartened to see how states have embraced the spirit of flexibility under ESSA to improve education for individual students,"" said Secretary DeVos. Allowing states more flexibility in how they deliver education to students is at the core of ESSA. Each state crafted a plan that it feels will best offer educational opportunities to meet the needs of the state and its students. The following are some of the unique elements from each state's approved plan as highlighted by each state: District of Columbia Creates the School Transparency and Reporting (STAR) framework, a universal framework for every public school in DC that will provide an easy-to-understand annual rating to each school based on 1-5 stars. Measures the quality of Pre-Kindergarten through use of the Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS), which assesses the quality of teacher-child interactions in early childhood classrooms. ""DC's plan is guided by our commitment to providing equitable access to high quality education for all students and flexibility for our schools to meet the unique needs of all students,"" said DC State Superintendent for Education Hanseul Kang. ""This plan is the right one for DC, and I am proud that it was informed by rigorous engagement with partners and community members, including the DC State Board of Education, local education agencies, parents, educators, and advocates."" Illinois Creates a College/Career Ready Indicator for high schools that measures the readiness of students for college based on several indicators, including GPA, performance on postsecondary readiness exams and attendance, in addition to considering community service hours, summer employment, participation in ROTC, and/or earning industry credentials. Uses survey responses from students to help assign schools a ""school climate"" score, giving students a chance to provide meaningful feedback and ensuring the student perspective will be a part of the school's overall summative rating. ""Illinois is committed to supporting the whole child in transforming learning opportunities for all students in our state,"" said Illinois State Superintendent of Education Tony Smith, Ph.D. ""We want every child to feel well known and well cared for in our schools and to receive the individual support they need for academic excellence and postsecondary success. The Illinois ESSA Plan gives us the opportunity to foster collaboration and partnerships to build educators' and leaders' capacity for improved student outcomes. We appreciate the partnership with the U.S. Department of Education throughout the ESSA process, and we look forward to our continued efforts on behalf of each and every child."" Oregon Prioritizes four commitments in its plan: advancing equity; creating a well-rounded education; strengthening district systems; and fostering ongoing stakeholder engagement. Implements a new ""Freshmen on track"" measure to confirm that students have completed at least 6 credits within the first semester of freshmen year, recognizing the importance of credit attainment in early high school in order to graduate on time. ""Today is a tremendous milestone for Oregon. Oregon's State Plan is founded on equity and represents the voices and communities we serve,"" Oregon Deputy Superintendent Salam Noor said. ""We want to put every one of our learners on a path to success from birth through high school, and beyond. And whether our students choose to attend college or go straight into the workforce, it's critical that their school experience is full of opportunity, and ensures they are college and career ready."" Tennessee Supports teacher and principal residencies to create more high-quality pipeline opportunities for prospective candidates to move into those roles; also establishes new grant initiatives that focus on increasing innovation and diversity in the educator workforce. Focuses on college readiness through the Tennessee Promise initiative. ""Our ESSA plan is built on what we've started in Tennessee and centered on the belief that every student should be ready for postsecondary when they graduate high school,"" said Tennessee Education Commissioner Candice McQueen. ""Tennessee's education community helped us to create a strong plan that will help us take our work to the next level, and we look forward to continuing these partnerships now as we move forward."""

In addition to internal agency briefings, the Department is participating in daily interagency briefings led by the Department of Homeland Security and FEMA in order to understand the extent of the damage to educational infrastructure and the needs of its education stakeholders in the wake of Harvey. The Department's interagency work will inform and enhance the resources and relief that it will make available to school districts and institutions of higher education as the recovery work begins. In addition to its Federal partners, the Department has reached out to the Texas Education Agency, the Louisiana Department of Education and institutions of higher learning in the impacted areas and will be coordinating its recovery activities through these agencies and institutions. The full extent of the Hurricane’s impact will not be known for some time but we will stay in close contact with our partners. Last week, the Department began contacting more than 200 colleges and universities located in areas likely impacted by Harvey and will provide administrative flexibilities related to federal student aid rules. The Department has also directed federal student loan servicers to provide impacted borrowers flexibility in managing their loan payments during this time. Borrowers can contact their student loan servicer for more information or call 1-800-4FED-AID (1-800-433-3243) to find out their servicer’s contact information."

Wayne Johnson, the new Chief Operating Officer of Federal Student Aid (FSA). “To improve customer service, we will take the best ideas and capabilities available and put them to work for Americans with student loans. When FSA customers transition to the new processing and servicing environment in 2019, they will find a customer support system that is as capable as any in the private sector. The result will be a significantly better experience for students – our customers – and meaningful benefits for the American taxpayer.” The anticipated FSA Next Generation Processing and Servicing Environment will provide for a single data processing platform to house all student loan information while at the same time allowing for customer account servicing to be performed either by a single contract servicer or by multiple contract servicers. This new approach is also expected to require separate acquisitions for database housing, system processing and customer account servicing which will allow for maximum flexibility today and into the future. FSA expects these contemplated changes to the servicing and processing environment to provide the opportunity for additional companies to submit proposals for contracting with FSA. “Doing what’s best for students will always be our number one priority,” said Secretary DeVos. “By starting afresh and pursuing a truly modern loan servicing environment, we have a chance to turn what was a good plan into a great one. “I hired Dr. Johnson for his extensive private sector expertise, his fresh perspective and his innovative thinking. After just a few weeks on the job, Wayne has already identified potential ways to modernize FSA and to leverage new technology that will not only enhance the customer service experience for borrowers but will also protect taxpayers.” Secretary DeVos recognizes the opportunities Dr. Johnson has identified to enhance FSA’s Next Generation Processing and Servicing Environment and accordingly the Department has cancelled the current student loan solicitation (Solicitation #ED-FSA-17-R-001). Contracts with current FSA student loan servicers expire in 2019. Dr. Johnson and his team will have the new processing and servicing environment in place prior to the expiration of the current contacts.

Trump donated his second quarter salary to the Department of Education to help fund a STEM-focused camp for students. The donation, totaling $100,000, was accepted by Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos at the daily White House Press briefing where she delivered the following remarks: “I want to start by saying how grateful I am to the President for this generous gift. The President has truly shown his commitment to our nation’s students and to reforming education in America so that every child, no matter their ZIP code, has access to a high quality education. “He and I have had many conversations about how best to put students’ needs first and to ensure we are setting them up for a lifetime of success. There is much work to be done, but we are certainly on the right track thanks to the President’s leadership. “Just yesterday, Ivanka Trump and I hosted a summer reading event at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History where the focus was on getting young girls, ages 6-10, excited about learning Science, Technology, Engineering and Math. It was fun to see their eyes light up as they got to explore, create and experiment in a collaborative environment. “Today’s and tomorrow’s economy requires engaged students, boys and girls, are prepared for STEM careers. That’s why we have decided to use the President’s 2nd quarter salary to host a STEM-focused camp for students at the Department of Education. We want to encourage as many children as possible to explore STEM fields in the hope that many develop a passion for these fields. “We look forward to this exciting endeavor. Again, thank you to President Trump for this generous gift.”"

""All of you have proven your commitment to furthering your education, and this award is a testament to your perseverance, long hours of study and passion."" ""President Donald Trump and I encourage each of you to not treat education as a path with a definitive end, but one that you will continue for your entire lives. There is always more to learn, study and gain, and I'm confident you will continue to find the rewards education can provide long after you've left the classroom."" PEAP was founded in 1983. Every year since then, the program has provided America's schools with the opportunity to recognize graduating students who meet high standards of academic excellence and those who have given their best effort, often overcoming obstacles to their learning. Each year, eligible graduating K-12 students are selected by their school principal for recognition in two categories. The President's Award for Educational Excellence - This award recognizes academic success in the classroom. To be eligible, students must meet requirements, including grade point average or school-set criteria and choice of state tests or teacher recommendations. The President's Award for Educational Achievement - This award recognizes students that show outstanding educational growth, improvement, commitment or intellectual development in their academic subjects but do not meet the criteria for the Educational Excellence Award. Its purpose is to encourage and reward students who give their best effort, often in the face of special obstacles. Criterion for this award is developed at each school. Individual recognition is bestowed by the President and the U.S. Secretary of Education, in partnership with the National Association of Elementary School Principals and the National Association of Secondary School Principals. The award includes a congratulatory letter to the student and certificate signed by the President, the Secretary and the school principal. Unlike other awards programs, the principal has sole discretion in choosing recipients based on eligibility. There is no limit on the number of awards, as long as students meet the criteria for each award set by the school.

This change in the Federal Pell Grant Program will allow an eligible student to receive up to 150 percent of the student's Federal Pell Grant Scheduled Award beginning with the 2017–2018 award year. To be eligible for the additional Pell Grant funds, the student must be otherwise eligible to receive Pell Grant funds for the payment period and must be enrolled at least half-time. For a student who is eligible for the additional Pell Grant funds, the institution must pay the student all of the student's eligible Pell Grant funds, up to 150 percent of the student's Pell Grant Scheduled Award for the award year. Unless the student has remaining eligibility from the 2016-2017 award year, the Department strongly recommends that institutions award Pell Grant funds for this summer out of the 2017-2018 award year since the additional funding will be available later in the year (e.g., spring or summer of 2018). Although institutions have the flexibility to assign crossover payment periods to either of the relevant award years, the new law provides that an institution must make the assignment ""as it determines is most beneficial to students."" Therefore, that decision should be based on what is in the best interest of the student and maximizes the student's eligibility over the two award years.

The Department intends to develop fair, effective and improved regulations to protect individual borrowers from fraud, ensure accountability across institutions of higher education and protect taxpayers. ""My first priority is to protect students,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""Fraud, especially fraud committed by a school, is simply unacceptable. Unfortunately, last year's rulemaking effort missed an opportunity to get it right. The result is a muddled process that's unfair to students and schools, and puts taxpayers on the hook for significant costs. It's time to take a step back and make sure these rules achieve their purpose: helping harmed students. It's time for a regulatory reset. It is the Department's aim, and this Administration's commitment, to protect students from predatory practices while also providing clear, fair and balanced rules for colleges and universities to follow."" Due to pending litigation challenging the BDR regulations, the Department is postponing the effective date pursuant to section 705 of the Administration Procedures Act. While negotiated rulemaking occurs, the Department will continue to process applications under the current borrower defense rules. ""Nearly 16,000 borrower defense claims are currently being processed by the Department, and, as I have said all along, promises made to students under the current rule will be promises kept,"" said Secretary DeVos. ""We are working with servicers to get these loans discharged as expeditiously as possible. Some borrowers should expect to obtain discharges within the next several weeks."" Postsecondary institutions of all types have raised concerns about the BDR regulations since they were published on Nov. 1, 2016. Colleges and universities are especially concerned about the excessively broad definitions of substantial misrepresentation and breach of contract, the lack of meaningful due process protections for institutions and ""financial triggers"" under the new rules. As part of the Department's regulatory review of its regulations, the agency will also convene a second negotiated rulemaking committee on Gainful Employment. As the Department worked on implementing this regulation, it became clear that, as written, it is overly burdensome and confusing for institutions of higher education. The Department plans to publish its Notice of Intent to Conduct Negotiated Rulemaking on BDR and GE in the Federal Register on June 16, 2017. The Department will conduct public hearings on BDR and GE on July 10, 2017, in Washington, D.C. and July 12, 2017, in Dallas, Texas."

It's great to be here with so many pioneers and champions who are fighting to give our nation's families more quality options in their children's education. We each have a different story of how we got here. Here's mine. ... Defenders of the status quo like to paint me as a ""voucher-only proponent"", but the truth is I've long-supported public charter schools as a quality option for students. I worked with many others to get Michigan's first charter legislation passed in 1993—the third state to do so. And my husband founded a charter high school in Michigan that focuses on aviation, educates kids in the STEM fields and prepares them to contribute in significant ways to our 21st century economy. Whatever your own journey looks like, we're here because we came to the same conclusion that, as a nation, we are simply not doing a good enough job educating our kids. We all saw too many kids languishing in schools that did not work for them. We knew that if given choices, these students and their families would find an environment that suited them and challenged them. Let me be clear up front: this is in no way an indictment of the great teachers working every day on behalf of their students. In fact, they should be honored, celebrated, and freed up to do what they do best. If there are any teachers—past or present—here today, will you please stand up? Thank you for all that you do. But they—and we—all live with the fact that the current structure of education is outdated and ultimately is not geared toward what is right and best for students. Let me tell two stories that illustrate this reality: I met Dan a few months ago. Dan and his wife weren't happy with their children's assigned school, so they did their research and found a school they thought would be a good fit for them. They had to stretch their family budget to buy a house in that school's district, but they thought it was a worthwhile investment for their children's futures. Unfortunately for them, right after they closed on their house, the school board redrew the lines and poof—Dan and his family were now assigned to a different school, this one with achievement levels much lower than the one they moved away from and the one they sacrificed their life savings for. When Dan took his case to the district, the response was, ""Too bad."" The second story: Sandy recently moved to Virginia, she was excited to be living in a highly-regarded, high-performing district. Her son completed the local school's assessments, and while he had just finished first grade, he tested at the fourth grade level. Yet the school told Sandy they didn't have anything to offer a gifted student like him and he would have to stay in second grade because of his age. So while the school district is well-regarded for its high performance, it shows that not even a great district is the best fit for every child. I can't justify either situation to these parents when they ask the same question each of us would ask, ""Why?"" ""Why can't my children go to the school I chose?"" ""Why isn't there a program that meets my child at his level?"" "" Why? "" The answer should not be, ""Take it, or literally leave it."" How can we be ok with an education structure that is so inflexible and so unaccommodating? Education is foundational to everything else in life, yet the process of acquiring it is based on a family's income or neighborhood. A system that denies parents the freedom to choose the education that best suits their children's individual and unique needs denies them a basic human right. It is un-American, and it is fundamentally unjust. Thankfully, you are among those who are working to give parents the freedom to find that education for their children. It's been more than a quarter century since the first charter law was enacted in Minnesota in 1991. That law didn't evolve out of a vacuum and it wasn't developed on a whim. It was passed in response to the stories of families like Dan's and Sandy's. Parents were desperate for more options, and they pressed for change. What began as a handful of schools in Minnesota has blossomed into nearly 7,000 schools in 44 states and the District of Columbia, serving more than 3 million students nationwide. Through your great work, you have proven that quality and choice can coexist. You've helped weave charter schools into the fabric of American education. Charter schools are here to stay . We're now seeing the first generation of charter students raising children of their own. They know the difference educational choice made in their lives, and now as parents they want the same options for their children. But we must recognize that charters aren't the right fit for every child. For many children, neither a traditional nor a charter public school works for them. Charters are not the one cure-all to the ills that beset education. Let's be honest: there's no such thing as a cure-all in education. Even the best school in the country with the best-trained educators and the most resources will not be the perfect fit for every single child. I suggest we focus less on what word comes before ""school""—whether it be traditional, charter, virtual, magnet, home, parochial, private or any approach yet to be developed—and focus instead on the individuals they are intended to serve. We need to get away from our orientation around buildings or systems or schools and shift our focus to individual students. Today, the United States is third in per-pupil spending among developed countries, yet our students rank 19th in science, 20th in reading and 24th in math. The problem is not how much we're spending; the problem is the results we're getting. Charters alone are not sufficient. Private schools alone are not sufficient. Neither are traditional schools. And that's ok. Let's humbly admit this fact and recognize that no top-down, one-size-fits-all approach will ever help us achieve the goal of giving every child an equal opportunity for a world class education. When a learning environment is not the best fit for a student, it's incumbent on us to facilitate their transition to one that does meet their needs. I was in Miami a few months ago and saw first-hand how a community is acting intentionally to meet the diverse needs of its students by providing a wide range of educational options. I visited three distinctly different schools: SLAM Charter School, Christian Academy for Reaching Excellence, or CARE, and Royal Palm Elementary. SLAM charter school, founded by Armando Perez—you may know him as ""Pitbull""—serves a low-income community with a large number of English learners. Many of the students anticipate being the first in their families to graduate high school, and some even had to enroll themselves in the school. For these kids, SLAM is providing a state-of-the-art learning environment that embraces the arts and athletics. CARE serves elementary-age children with a focused outreach to those who are homeless or victims of sexual assault. Located in a homeless shelter in one of the poorest neighborhoods in Miami, CARE gives these kids, who often struggled in a larger school setting, a safe and nurturing environment that addresses their unique needs. The vast majority of students attending CARE do so at no cost to their parents through Florida's Tax Credit Scholarship Program. Miami-Dade Public Schools' Royal Palm Elementary serves children from its neighborhood and beyond. Led by a dynamic principal and a creative group of teachers who clearly love their work, it was evident why the parents of these students chose this experience for their children. I celebrate the fact that each of these schools is helping students succeed in unique ways. The parents I met didn't care that these were different types of schools; they cared that the school was working for their son or daughter. These schools are simply representative of what is possible in an environment of robust choices. Education is not a zero-sum game. We should not think of it as such. There is no one right way to help kids learn, and just because a school educates children differently than you might propose to does not make them the enemy. Let's applaud and encourage others who serve students well. It's a both/and situation, not an either/or. A zero-sum myth is continually perpetuated by the education establishment. We cannot—we must not—fall prey to that game. Charter schools were created to address the fact that for too many kids, their assigned public school wasn't working for them. The early charter school leaders weren't afraid to color outside of the lines, and in fact, they embraced the creativity, innovation and flexibility charters represented. But somewhere along the way, in the intervening twenty-six years and through the process of expansion, we've taken the colorful collage of charters and drawn our own set of lines around it to box others out, to mitigate risk, to play it safe. This is not what we set out to do, and, more importantly, it doesn't help kids. No one has a monopoly on innovation. No one has a monopoly on creativity. No one has a monopoly on knowing how every child learns. Charters' success should be celebrated, but it's equally important not to [quote] ""become the man."" I thought it was a tough but fair criticism when a friend recently wrote in an article that many who call themselves ""reformers"" have instead become just another breed of bureaucrats—a new education establishment. We don't need 500 page charter school applications. That's not progress. That's fundamentally at odds with why parents demanded charters in the first place. Innovation, iteration and improvement must be a constant in our work. Today we have a great opportunity. While some of you have criticized the President's budget—which you have every right to do—it's important to remember that our budget proposal supports the greatest expansion of public school choice in the history of the United States. It significantly increases support for the Charter School Program, and adds an additional $1 billion for public school choice for states that choose to adopt it. This Administration has sent a clear message: we trust parents, and we believe in students. We will fight for every parent and every child, especially those who for too long have been forgotten. The window of opportunity is narrow and the stakes are too high for us not to act. We must act boldly, and we must act now . So let's reengage and recommit to the entrepreneurial spirit that gave rise to charters twenty-six years ago. Embracing more change, more choices and more innovation will improve education opportunities and outcomes for all students. Take a moment and picture a child whom you have helped get a great education. For me, I picture Angie and Denisha. ... Now think about Dan, and Sandy and all the other families who need those same opportunities. Drawing our own new lines won't help those trapped inside them. It's time to put down the permanent marker and straight edge, and instead pick up your brush and palette and paint. Paint in bright, bold colors and continue to add to the colorful collage that was started twenty-six years ago. We cannot let the opportunity go to waste. Act— act now! For Angie...for Denisha...for Dan...for Sandy...and for every parent and every child across America. We owe it to them, and we owe it to our nation. Thank you, and God bless you for all you do for America's students."

I look forward to talking about how we can work together to improve educational opportunities and outcomes for all students while also refocusing the Federal role in education. Our Mission to Help Students Succeed Today's hearing is meant to focus on the numbers and mechanics of the budget, but I hope we'll all remember our goal and our shared purpose: how to best serve America's students. During my House appropriations subcommittee hearing, I relayed the story of one of those students—a young man named Michael who grew up in East Harford, Connecticut. Michael, in his own words, described to me what life was like for him in high school. I quoted him last month and I will quote him again, because his words are worth repeating: he said his assigned high school was ""nothing more than adult day care ... a dangerous daycare."" And, even though Michael was failing his classes, his school graduated him anyway. He got a diploma, but not an education. Since sharing Michael's story, this young man has been barraged by attacks. But Michael has tremendous courage, and instead of being intimidated, he wrote an op-ed published in this Sunday's Hartford Courant where he admonished his attackers, writing: ""Rather than automatically getting into a defensive crouch at perceived slights, let's admit that these serious and real problems exist, and that there's a lot of work to do. Let's give the kids and families who feel trapped the opportunity to find something better."" Let me be clear. My relaying of Michael's story is not a blanket indictment of public schools, of Connecticut schools or even of East Hartford High School. Just as the rest of Michael's story – the story of his profound success, which has gone largely unreported – is not a blanket endorsement of community colleges, of the Florida system of higher education or of Valencia College, where Michael is now in the school's honors program. What Michael's story is, is the real life situation far too many of our students face: they are trapped in an education system, that for whatever reason, is not serving them, and they have no other choices. In 2017, in America, we can – we must – do better. I'm proud to stand with Michael. Students like him are why I am so passionate about reforming education. I ask you to keep Michael, and the countless others like him, in mind as we go about our shared work to support America's students. Investing in Programs That Work This budget lays out a series of proposals and priorities that work toward ensuring every student has an equal opportunity to receive a great education. It focuses on returning decision-making power and flexibility to the states, where it belongs, and giving parents more control over their child's education, a right that has been denied for too long. If taxpayer money were limitless, we wouldn't need a budget. But by its very definition, a budget reflects the difficult decisions of how best to appropriate the limited taxpayer dollars we have. This budget does so by putting an emphasis on programs that are proven to help students, while taking a hard look at those that are well-intended but haven't yielded meaningful results. Five Principles Guiding the Budget Request The President's fiscal year 2018 budget would reduce overall funding for Department programs by $9 billion, or 13 percent, and I'd like to outline for you the principles that guided our decision-making. First, our request would devote significant resources toward giving every student an equal opportunity for a great education. It emphasizes giving parents more power and students more opportunities. Second, the Administration's request recognizes the importance of maintaining strong support for public schools through longstanding State formula grant programs focused on meeting the educational needs of the nation's most vulnerable students, including poor and minority students and students with disabilities. Third, our request maintains funding for key competitive grant programs that support innovation and build evidence of what works in education. This also means strong support for the research and data collection activities of the Department. Fourth, our request reduces the complexity of funding for college while prioritizing efforts to help make a college education accessible for low-income students through programs like Year-Round Pell. And fifth, consistent with our commitment to improve the efficiency of the Federal government, our request would eliminate or phase-out 22 programs that are duplicative, ineffective, or are better supported through State, local or philanthropic efforts. All told, taxpayers will save $5.8 billion. Empowering Parents and States, Helping Students In total, the President's budget fulfills his promise to devolve power from the Federal government and place it in the hands of parents and families. It refocuses the Department on supporting States in their efforts to provide a high-quality education to all of our students. It is time to unleash a new era of creativity and ingenuity in education. My hope is that – working in concert with each of you – we can make education in America the envy of the world. Thank you again for the opportunity to share the Administration's vision for improving education across the country. I look forward to respond to any questions you may have."

Our Mission to Help Students Succeed While today's hearing is meant to focus on the numbers and mechanics of the budget, I hope we'll all remember our goal and our purpose: how to best serve America's students. Allow me to share just one example: I recently met a young man—Michael—whose story truly spoke to me. Michael grew up in East Hartford, Connecticut, in a low-income neighborhood. He was an average student throughout elementary and middle school, but that all changed when he reached the district high school. Michael described a school where students were the real ones in charge of the class, and they would make it impossible for the teacher to teach. He was constantly bullied, to the point he was afraid to even go to the school's bathroom, and this constant fear made him hate school. He described the school he was assigned to as, and I quote, ""nothing more than adult day care ... a dangerous daycare."" But even though he was failing his classes, the school simply passed him along from year-to-year, giving him D's and sending the not-so-subtle message that they didn't think Michael would amount to much. Michael got a diploma, but not an education. Michael followed the path he thought he was destined for, working in a low-skill, low-wage job. But with the encouragement of his wife, Michael took a course at the local community college to see what was possible for him. He found an environment that was invested in his success, and much to his surprise, Michael earned an A. He thought it was a fluke. So he took more classes, and lo and behold, he earned more A's. He's now in the school's honors program with the goal of working as an emergency room nurse. His success is America's success. Access to a quality education is the path to the American dream. So I ask you to keep Michael, and countless other students like him, in mind as we go about our shared work to support America's students. No student should feel they attend a ""dangerous daycare."" No child's dreams should be limited by the quality, or lack thereof, of the education they receive. Investing in Programs That Work This budget lays out a series of proposals and priorities that work toward ensuring every student has an equal opportunity to receive a great education. It focuses on returning decision-making power and flexibility to the states, where it belongs, and giving parents more control over their child's education. Parents deserve that right, and frankly, that right has been denied for too long. We cannot allow any parent to feel their child is trapped in a school that isn't meeting his or her unique needs. The budget also reflects a series of tough choices. If taxpayer money were limitless, we wouldn't need a budget at all. But by its very definition, a budget reflects the difficult decisions of how best to appropriate the limited taxpayer dollars we have. This budget does so by putting an emphasis on the programs that are proven to help students, while taking a hard look at programs that are well-intended but simply haven't yielded meaningful results. This is why the President's fiscal year 2018 budget would reduce overall funding for Department programs by $9 billion, or 13 percent. I've seen the headlines, and I understand those figures may sound alarming for some; however, this budget refocuses the Department on supporting States and school districts in their efforts to provide high-quality education to all our students. At the same time, the budget simplifies funding for college, while continuing to help make a higher education more accessible to all.

As Congress prepares to reauthorize the Higher Education Act, I look forward to working with you to address student debt and higher education costs while accelerating and improving student completion rates through such efforts as Year-Round Pell, and reducing the complexity of student financial aid. And fifth, consistent with our commitment to improve the efficiency of the Federal government, our request would eliminate or phase-out 22 programs that are duplicative, ineffective, or are better supported through State, local or philanthropic efforts. Six additional programs were already eliminated in the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. All told, taxpayers will save $5.8 billion.

Research shows that increasing education options can have positive effects on students generally, and an even greater impact on poor and minority students. If we truly want to provide better education to underserved communities, then we must start with giving parents and students the power to select high-quality schools that meet their needs. I want to unleash a new era of creativity and ingenuity in the education space. My hope is that—working in concert with each of you—we can make education in America the envy of the rest of the world. Thank you again for the opportunity to share the Administration's vision for improving education across the country. I look forward to respond to any questions you may have."

Through this budget, the President has reaffirmed his commitment to returning decision-making power over education back where it belongs—in the hands of parents, educators and State leaders. U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos issued the following statement: ""This budget makes a historic investment in America's students. President Trump is committed to ensuring the Department focuses on returning decision-making power back to the States, where it belongs, and on giving parents more control over their child's education. It also ensures stable funding for critical programs, including Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). ""The budget also reflects a series of tough choices we have had to make when assessing the best use of taxpayer money. It ensures funding for programs with proven results for students while taking a hard look at programs that sound nice but simply haven't yielded the desired outcomes. ""By refocusing the Department's funding priorities on supporting students, we can usher in a new era of creativity and ingenuity and lay a new foundation for American greatness."" Key initiatives in the President's 2018 budget are below: Creating New Education Options through School Choice $1 billion increase for Title I for new Furthering Options for Children to Unlock Success (FOCUS) grants. FOCUS grants would provide supplemental awards to school districts that adopt student-centered weighted student funding formulas combined with open enrollment systems. $250 million increase for the Education Innovation and Research (EIR) program for competitive awards for applicants to provide scholarships for students from low-income families to attend the private school of their parents' choice. $167 million increase for the Charter Schools Grants program to strengthen State efforts to start new charter schools or expand and replicate existing high-performing charter schools while providing up to $100 million to meet the growing demand for charter school facilities. Maintaining Support for the Nation's Most Vulnerable Students $14.9 billion in level funding for the core Title I Grants to local education agencies (LEAs) program to support State and local efforts to ensure that more than 25 million students in high-poverty schools have access to rigorous coursework and teaching. $12.7 billion to maintain the Federal investment in the IDEA formula grant programs, which help support services to the 6.8 million children with disabilities nationwide and to States in their ongoing work to design and implement program improvement efforts under the Department's Results Driven Accountability framework. $736 million for the English Language Acquisition program to implement effective language instruction educational programs designed to help English learners attain English language proficiency. Simplifying Funding for Postsecondary Education Safeguards and strengthens the Pell Grant program by level funding the discretionary appropriation and supporting year-round Pell, which will increase aid available to eligible students by $16.3 billion over 10 years. The budget also proposes the cancellation of $3.9 billion from unobligated carryover funding; this cancellation will have no effect on students and will leave the Pell program on sound footing. Simplifies loan repayment for students by replacing five different income driven repayment plans with a single plan aimed at prioritizing expedited loan repayment for undergraduate borrowers. Provides $808.3 million for the Federal TRIO Programs and $219 million for GEAR UP, resulting in savings of $193 million from the 2017 annualized CR level. Funding for these programs is reduced in areas that are either not supported by rigorous evidence of effectiveness or that can be supported through other resources. Provides $492 million for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Minority-Serving Institutions, and Hispanic-Serving Institutions through the Higher Education Act Titles III and V programs. Titles III and V funding are important vehicles for helping close gaps among racial and socioeconomic groups in college enrollment and degree attainment by improving these institutions' academic programs, institutional capacity and student support services. Reduces Federal Work-Study while reforming the poorly-targeted program to ensure funds go to undergraduate students who would benefit most. Building Evidence around Educational Innovation $616.8 million for the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) for continued support of State and local-based research, evaluation and statistics that help educators, policymakers and other stakeholders improve outcomes for all students. $370 million for Education Innovation and Research to expand support for evidence-based initiatives to develop, validate and scale up effective education interventions that help States and LEAs meet Elementary and Secondary Education Act requirements. $42 million for Supporting Effective Educator Development (SEED) to provide evidence-based professional development activities and prepare teachers and principals from nontraditional preparation and certification routes to serve in high-need LEAs. Streamlining Existing Programs Eliminates funding for Supporting Effective Instruction State grants, a reduction of $2.3 billion. The program is proposed for elimination because evidence shows the program is poorly structured to support activities that have a measurable impact on improving student outcomes and it duplicates other ESEA program funds that may be used for professional development. Eliminates funding for the 21st Century Community Learning Center program, saving $1.2 billion. The program lacks strong evidence of meeting its objectives, such as improving student achievement. Eliminates Striving Readers/Comprehensive Literacy Development Grants, which will save $190 million. This program has limited impact (only 5-10 State grants are expected in the final cohort) and duplicates activities that may be supported with other Federal, State, local and private funds. Note that because the President's budget was completed before final fiscal year 2017 appropriations action, all comparisons are to the 2017 annualized CR level.

The Secretary introduced the principles of the Trump Administration's school choice plan, urging state leaders to invest in individual students and empower parents, while outlining the Administration's intent to support state-based solutions. Key excerpts from the Secretary's speech: ""If you hear nothing else I say tonight, please hear this – education should not be a partisan issue. Sure, various approaches to education policy should be hotly debated, and they certainly are. ""But, making sure that all of our kids get a great education – how could it be a partisan issue? Everyone – in both parties – should support equal opportunity in education, regardless of a child's income, zip code or family circumstances. ... ""The time has expired for 'reform'. We need a transformation – a transformation that will open up America's closed and antiquated education system. ""If we really want to help students, then we need to focus everything about education on individual students – funding, supporting and investing in them. Not in buildings; not in systems. ... ""In order to succeed, education must commit to excellence and innovation to better meet the needs of individual students. Defenders of our current system have regularly been resistant to any meaningful change. In resisting, these 'flat-earthers' have chilled creativity and stopped American kids from competing at the highest levels. Our current framework is a closed system that relies on one-size-fits-all solutions. We need an open system that envelopes choices and embraces the future. ... ""We shouldn't view this, however, as a chance to mandate a one-size-fits-all school choice proposal. We all fundamentally know one size doesn't fit all...and that we won't accomplish our goals by creating a new federal bureaucracy or by bribing states with their own taxpayers' money. We should have zero interest in substituting the current big government approach for our own big government approach. ""When it comes to education, no solution, not even ones we like, should be dictated or run from Washington, DC. ... ""I firmly believe every state should provide choices and embrace equal opportunity in education. But those are decisions states must make. No two states are the same and no two states' approaches will be the same – and that's a good thing. States are the best laboratories of our democracy. ... ""The drive for education choice started in the states, and it was started by caring parents from every race and political party. ... ""The President is proposing the most ambitious expansion of education choice in our nation's history. The proposal's aim is to empower states and give leaders like Gov. Eric Holcomb the flexibility and opportunity to enhance the choices Indiana provides for Indiana students. ""If a state doesn't want to participate, that would be a terrible mistake on their part. They will be hurting the children and families who can least afford it. If politicians in a state block education choice, it means those politicians do not support equal opportunity for all kids. They'll be the ones who will have to explain to their constituent parents why they are denying their fundamental right to choose what type of education is best for their child. ... ""These students – and millions and millions more just like them – from every race, from every background, from our cities, our suburbs and rural America – they are why we care; they are why we fight; they are why we will never, ever back down in our effort to give them the great education they deserve."""

The amendment maintains superior customer service and key borrower protections while ensuring the project stays on budget, saving taxpayers more than $130 million over the next five years. The amendment further clarifies the Department's expectations of the eventual servicer and formally lists all requirements in the solicitation. U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos issued the following statement on the new amendment: ""From day one, my priority as Secretary of Education has been to put students' needs first. This amended solicitation does just that. It maintains superior customer service and borrower protections while increasing oversight and protecting taxpayers. ""The federal student loan servicing solicitation we inherited was cumbersome and confusing—with shifting deadlines, changing requirements and de-facto regulations that at times contradicted themselves. Internal and external stakeholders both agreed it was destined for a massive and unsustainable budget overrun. ""In order to ensure the best outcome for federal student loan borrowers, it was necessary to rescind the previous guidance to free the Department to craft a solution that was more responsive to the needs of both customers and taxpayers. ""With changes in the new amendment, we have simplified the process to ensure meaningful borrower protections while saving taxpayers more than $130 million over the next five years. Savings are expected to increase significantly over the life of the contract. Borrowers can expect to see a more user-friendly loan servicing interface, shorter email and call response times and an improved payment application method that will maximize the benefit of each payment the borrower makes. Our amendment makes no changes to repayment plan requirements. ""I am committed to helping students meet their repayment obligations and reaching their academic goals while also making government more effective and efficient."" The amendment published today is the ninth amendment to the Department's federal student loan servicing solicitation. Federal law and regulations governing the procurement process prohibited Department officials from commenting on the new amendment until it was formally published today.

Her life's work was to help all students succeed, and it was clear today that she succeeded beyond comparison. ""One of the hallmarks of higher education, and of democracy, is the ability to converse with and learn from those with whom we disagree.

The Secretary was awarded a Doctor of Humane Letters, honoris causa by B-CU president Dr. Edison O. Jackson. In her remarks, Secretary DeVos reaffirmed the Administration’s strong support for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and for year-round Pell grants to help students reach their academic goals. Secretary DeVos called on B-CU graduates to meet the challenges of the world head-on, through service, courage and grace, invoking the lasting work and legacy of B-CU’s founder and civil rights icon Dr. Mary McLeod Bethune. Highlights from the Secretary’s speech include the following: “I am here to celebrate you and all of your achievements. We are all here to applaud your perseverance and to encourage each of you to keep working to reach your full potential. And I’m here to demonstrate, in the most tangible way I know how, that I and the entire Administration are fully committed to your success and to the success of every student across this great country. … “The degree conferred on you today is the culmination of time, energy and effort invested and knowledge, experience and skills gained. However, the sum of your education here involved far more than sleepless nights spent cramming for a big exam, hours invested putting the finishing touches on papers, and time devoted to clubs, organizations and causes. The whole of your time at Bethune-Cookman University – your experiences, your relationships and your hard work – has laid a foundation for you to appreciate your responsibilities to your peers, your community, your country and the world. … “[I]n 1904, with a burning determination in her soul and a meager dollar-fifty in her pocket, Dr. Bethune built a school from the ground up. Over the course of her incredible 79-year lifespan, she fought for one singular and invaluable goal: to provide African-American children access to a quality education, access they were otherwise unjustly denied. … “Dr. Bethune believed students – you – had an unlimited potential to affect positive change, and with good reason. She’d done it herself. “As you leave, each of you will be called to embody courage in different ways and to rise to different challenges. The way you answer those calls will determine not just the future of you and your homes, but of your communities, this great nation and your world. … “The natural instinct is to join in the chorus of conflict, to make your voice louder, your point bigger and your position stronger. But we will not solve the significant and real problems our country faces if we cannot bring ourselves to embrace a mindset of grace. We must first listen, then speak – with humility – to genuinely hear the perspectives of those with whom we don’t immediately or instinctively agree.” A copy of the Secretary’s full remarks is below: “A Calling to Service, Courage and Grace” Thank you, Dr. Jackson, for that very kind introduction. It’s a real privilege – and honor – to be with you as we celebrate the Bethune-Cookman University class of 2017! Congratulations to all of you! In addition to the graduates, there are so many people deserving of special recognition today: parents, grandparents, family members and friends of the graduates, thank you for your effort in helping them get to this point. First Lady Florence Jackson, Chairman Petrock and Members of the Board, Provost Walrond and members of the administrative staff and faculty, and the entire Bethune-Cookman community, thank you for the important role you all play in making today possible for these students. Mayor Henry, thank you for those encouraging words, and thank you and the other state and local elected officials for being here today. AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT I am grateful for the opportunity to speak with you, and particularly with those who have disagreed with the invitation for me to be here. One of the hallmarks of higher education, and of democracy, is the ability to converse with and learn from those with whom we disagree. And while we will undoubtedly disagree at times, I hope we can do so respectfully. Let’s choose to hear each other out. I want to re-affirm this Administration’s commitment to and support for HBCUs and the students they serve. Please know this: we support you, and we will continue to support you. That is one reason why we support restoring year-round Pell Grants. This commonsense solution will enable more students to further their educations without taking on additional debt. I am at the table fighting on your behalf, and on behalf of all students across this great nation. I also want to acknowledge that we all arrived here today with different life experiences and different perspectives. I view that not as a negative, but as a gift. Anytime we meet someone new, we have two options: we can focus on differences that might divide us, or we can choose to listen, to be receptive and to learn from others’ experiences and perspectives. In my life, I have endeavored to do the latter, and as you leave this arena today, I hope you too, will chose this posture as you set out on this new and exciting stage of your life’s adventure. I am here to celebrate you and all of your achievements. We are all here to applaud your perseverance and to encourage each of you to keep working to reach your full potential. And I’m here to demonstrate, in the most tangible way I know how, that I and the entire Administration are fully committed to your success and to the success of every student across this great country. That commitment to success is one I know I share with your President, Dr. Edison Jackson. Dr. Jackson has long focused on creating opportunities for students and is an authentic advocate for lifelong learning. Each of you who has had occasion to interact with or work alongside Dr. Jackson knows he has a profound, deep-seeded faith and an abiding belief in the transformational power of character, moral courage and purpose. Dr. Jackson, thank you for your daily work to secure and make available a life-changing education for the students you serve. Your career is a personal inspiration to me, and it is the embodiment of B-CU’s motto: Enter to Learn; Depart to Serve. A CALL TO SERVE Graduates, you have heeded the first charge in that motto, and today stand at the interval preceding the second. I challenge you to leave this arena, faithful to completing the mission. The words are simple, yet powerful: depart to serve. It is good and right to pause today to celebrate your individual successes, but after that reflection, I am confident you will find service more rewarding than anything else. In serving, you will always reap more than you sow. The degree conferred on you today is the culmination of time, energy and effort invested and knowledge, experience and skills gained. However, the sum of your education here involved far more than sleepless nights spent cramming for a big exam, hours invested putting the finishing touches on papers, and time devoted to clubs, organizations and causes. The whole of your time at Bethune-Cookman University – your experiences, your relationships and your hard work – has laid a foundation for you to appreciate your responsibilities to your peers, your community, your country and the world. Today you transition from student to graduate. What may have seemed an eternity away the moment you walked onto campus is now standing before you. You’ll leave this place as the leaders who will transform the world. The tomorrow for which you’ve worked so hard to prepare has arrived, and it’s yours to shape. Your actions will determine the type of world you create, enjoy and leave to your children and grandchildren. I posit that a fundamental component in that pursuit to shape your world can be found in personal service . You may choose to give back by mentoring or volunteering. You may pour your life into creating equal opportunities for all, pursuing justice, tackling the toughest medical challenges, educating the rising generation, donning our Nation’s uniform to protect and defend our freedoms or making a discovery on the cutting edge of science, technology or engineering. I know BCU has prepared each of you well for these tasks. The human heart is hardwired toward service, and it’s embedded in the DNA of this institution. No doubt you know Dr. Mary McLeod Bethune’s amazing story very well, but let me share some of it for those beyond this hall who don’t. She was a visionary, a leader I admire and respect, and someone about whom all Americans should know. As one of 17 children born to parents who knew firsthand the horrors and injustice of slavery, Dr. Bethune was the only member of her family to be educated in a formal school setting. For her, education was a gift and an incredible privilege. She believed it was her sacred duty to use her education to uplift others. So in 1904, with a burning determination in her soul and a meager dollar-fifty in her pocket, Dr. Bethune built a school from the ground up. Over the course of her incredible 79-year lifespan, she fought for one singular and invaluable goal: to provide African-American children access to a quality education, access they were otherwise unjustly denied. Her commitment to service is what has brought us together today. This inspired daughter of slaves refused to accept repulsive and systemic racism. She moved mountains, changing the lives and futures of countless students and families across generations. Just think about the impact of Dr. Bethune’s selfless, singular focus. Then consider the influence that you, as a graduate, could have on the lives of others – both now and into the future. All that is required for world-shaking change is your conscious and courageous decision to serve. Your path here was shaped by others – educators, parents, family members, neighbors and friends. Never forget that. Through serving others, you can extend that legacy. A CALL TO COURAGE Later today I will have the honor of visiting Dr. Bethune’s home and paying my respects at her gravesite. I am moved by words in her last will and testament, where Dr. Bethune described what she hoped her legacy would be. The beautifully written testament cited love, hope and a thirst for education as the ideals she wanted people to embrace in her memory. She concluded with a section titled ‘A Responsibility to our Young People,’ and made clear her unshakeable belief that the world’s fate belonged to the youth she dedicated her entire life to serving. In it, she wrote: “Our children must never lose their zeal for building a better world. They must not be discouraged from aspiring toward greatness, for they are to be the leaders of tomorrow. Nor must they forget that the masses of our people are still underprivileged, ill-housed, impoverished and victimized by discrimination. We have a powerful potential in our youth, and we must have the courage to change old ideas and practices so that we may direct their power toward good ends.” I note three core themes in her words: First: aim high, aspire to greatness. Dr. Bethune believed, without wavering, that your potential is limitless. Second: take responsibility for your families and your communities and never tolerate inequality or injustice. Third: proceed with courage to change old ideas that hold others back. These are charges – and encouragements – I echo to each of you today. Dr. Bethune believed students – you – had an unlimited potential to affect positive change, and with good reason. She’d done it herself. As you leave, each of you will be called to embody courage in different ways and to rise to different challenges. The way you answer those calls will determine not just the future of you and your homes, but of your communities, this great nation and your world. Your university serves as a reminder that every student, without exception, deserves a high-quality education. Some of you graduates are the first in your families to earn a college degree, and some of you have overcome incredible personal hardships to reach this day. Deondre Jamal Sanstad was the victim of an accidental shooting after his freshman year. His doctor told him he would never walk again, but Deondre had different plans. Not only did he resume his studies, he poured himself into his rehabilitation and got back on his feet. Today, Deondre stands tall among you as a candidate to receive his degree, and is already taking the next steps to pursue an MBA. Ca’Netta General never really thought about attending college before landing at BCU as a non-traditional student. But with help from the Palm Beach Urban League, she found her passion for helping others through radio and television. This discovery fueled her confidence and commitment to her studies, as her ambitions soared. Ca’Netta became involved with 14 organizations and numerous other campus activities and today is an accomplished mass communications graduate. Jahlil Yuzell Witt is graduating today with a Bachelor of Arts in Liberal Studies, with a concentration in Marketing. Jahlil was born to a single mother who struggled with drug addiction. At a very young age he entered the foster care system, where he was subjected to a never-ending cycle of neglect and abuse. Despite the extraordinary challenges he faced throughout his upbringing, he exceled at his studies at B-CU and went on to become Mr. B-CU, Mr. Sophomore, and he even developed a motivational program called “From Blocks to Books” dedicated to inspiring and empowering young people. Jahlil also writes and performs music. After graduation, he plans to relocate to Atlanta to pursue his dream of starting a record label. Each of these students’ stories is one of courage. These stories speak to how BCU rises to meet the unique needs of every student it serves. We should aspire to make all of America’s educational institutions mirror that model – a singular focus on the needs of individual students. Our nation has made remarkable progress since Dr. Bethune founded this University, but addressing inequities in our education system remains a very real challenge. Empowering students with the opportunity to pursue the best possible education has been my focus for the past three decades. America is simply too great a country to deny any child this equal opportunity. Your courage will be needed to confront this challenge as you raise families, pursue careers and lead in communities across the nation. I hope each of us will leave here today challenged to ensure no child is denied the benefits of a quality education. Many of you have already shown courage in this regard by pursuing teaching as a vocation. I want to take a moment to highlight and honor each of you who are graduating from the College of Education. Not coincidentally, this is National Teacher Appreciation Week. I hope each of you will take a moment to reach out and thank a teacher who was impactful in your life – many of them no doubt with us here today. I expect many of you are here in part because, somewhere along the line, a teacher went out of his or her way to make sure you succeeded. Please join me now in personally thanking and applauding each of you who have served, serve or will serve, as an educator. A CALL TO GRACE Education broadens our horizons and enables us to confront realities we’d never before anticipated. We should welcome these opportunities with open arms. We should embrace the chance to grow and to serve. We should pursue these opportunities with humility, with perseverance and with grace. That is my final challenge to you: approach the unanticipated, the unexpected, the unforeseen with grace. Spend just a few minutes watching your favorite cable news channel and you’ll experience the startling polarization happening across the United States. On social media, groups and individuals pit themselves one against the other, not to discuss and debate the merits of deeply held beliefs, but to see who can yell the loudest, score the quickest political points or best silence the other’s voice. The natural instinct is to join in the chorus of conflict, to make your voice louder, your point bigger and your position stronger. But we will not solve the significant and real problems our country faces if we cannot bring ourselves to embrace a mindset of grace. We must first listen, then speak – with humility – to genuinely hear the perspectives of those with whom we don’t immediately or instinctively agree. These verses from Colossians have been a guide for me: “Be wise in the way you act toward outsiders; make the most of every opportunity. Let your conversation always be full of grace, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how to answer everyone.” Those words are as relevant today as when they were first imparted. They are exhortations with the power to transform our approach to life, our commitment to our neighbors and our discourse with one another. Elie Wiesel, who survived the horrors of Auschwitz, put it well: “For me, every hour is grace. And I feel gratitude in my heart each time I can meet someone and look at his or her smile.” I will admit many in my generation haven’t done a great job when it comes to dealing with one another in grace. You have an opportunity to do better, to lead the way towards a new era of engagement in our communities. IN CONCLUSION You leave this place today with many obligations, but I hope you’ll consider the three challenges I’ve presented: A call to service. A call to courage. And a call to grace. Years from now when someone asks you, “Why do you serve?” you can respond, “Because a great woman – a great leader – a great American – Dr. Mary McLeod Bethune – inspired me.” When you face the challenges of your day, you can say, “I was courageous because Dr. Bethune showed me the way.” And when some pursue dissention, you can engage in debate with grace and poise, just as Dr. Bethune did. Each of you has a story of your own, waiting to be written. You make us proud – and more than that, you give us hope. You have achieved something special today. I am humbled by the opportunity to be with you, to share in this momentous occasion in your life, to cheer on your past and continued success. Congratulations, and may God continue to bless our nation, Bethune-Cookman University and each of you, the Class of 2017. ###"

""I congratulate this year's class of Presidential Scholars for their devotion to academic excellence and their parents and teachers who have guided them along the way,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. “Today's Presidential Scholars are tomorrow's leaders, and I am confident they will continue to be shining examples as they enter the next phase of their academic careers.” The White House Commission on Presidential Scholars selects scholars annually based on their academic success, artistic excellence, essays, school evaluations and transcripts, as well as evidence of community service, leadership, and demonstrated commitment to high ideals. Of the 3.5 million students expected to graduate from high school this year, more than 5,100 candidates qualified for the 2017 awards determined by outstanding performance on the College Board SAT and ACT exams, through nominations made by Chief State School Officers , other partner recognition organizations or the National YoungArts Foundation’s nationwide YoungArts™competition .

Created in 1964, the U.S. Presidential Scholars Program has honored almost 7,500 of the nation’s top-performing students with the prestigious award given to honorees during an annual ceremony in Washington. The program was expanded in 1979 to recognize students who demonstrate exceptional talent in the visual, literary and performing arts. In 2015, the program was again extended to recognize students who demonstrate ability and accomplishment in career and technical education fields. The 2017 ceremony will be held June 18, when each honoree will receive a Presidential Scholar Medallion.

MCCF offers integrated, onsite education and career development services through its American Job Center. This center provides full-time GED, vocational and special education programs, and assists incarcerated individuals with skills assessments, job searches and further education planning before their release. “During National Reentry Week, and throughout the year, we can recognize and support education’s power to help those leaving our justice system rebuild their character, reform their lives and realize their true potential.”"

The announcement is part of an ongoing effort to provide additional assistance to students and families impacted by the suspension of the Internal Revenue Service Data Retrieval Tool (IRS DRT). “When I learned the IRS DRT would need to be offline for an extended period of time to add additional security and privacy measures, I directed Federal Student Aid to help students and families successfully complete their applications without use of the IRS DRT. “These flexibilities are an important step toward making the process easier. They help applicants who normally would have used the IRS DRT to more easily complete the application process. “We will continue to look for additional ways to ease the burdens created by the IRS DRT outage until the tool can be restored with added security measures in place later this year.” The new options available to institutions are designed to support those applicants who may not have had all of their required tax-related documentation available. They include: IRS Tax Return Filers – In lieu of using the IRS DRT, or obtaining an IRS transcript, institutions may consider a signed paper copy of the 2015 IRS tax return that was used by the tax filer for submission to the IRS as acceptable documentation to verify information provided on the FAFSA Verification of Nonfiling – Institutions are no longer required to collect documentation obtained from the IRS or other tax authorities verifying that the applicant, the applicant’s spouse or the applicant’s parents did not file a 2015 tax return (often referred to as Verification of Nonfiling). The new flexibilities begin immediately and apply to both the 2016-17 and 2017-18 FAFSA processing and verification cycles. The full letter sent to institutions is available: https://ifap.ed.gov/dpcletters/GEN1704.html . Additional details on the IRS DRT are available: Joint IRS/FSA Statement and IRS DRT Resources ."

That’s why this Administration is committed to supporting and highlighting career and technical education. “Snap-On’s partnership with Gateway Technical College is a great example of what can be achieved when business and education collaborate. Together, they provide employees with the skills necessary for good-paying jobs, in turn benefitting the entire community’s economy. This type of partnership can be replicated across the country, and the President’s Buy American and Hire American Executive Order puts us on that path. “I applaud the President for his commitment to our nation’s students and workers, and his efforts to ensure we have a workforce equipped to fill American jobs that are open and readily available today.”"

While we are working to resolve these issues as quickly as possible, students and families should plan for the tool to be offline until the start of the next FAFSA season. Since the tool was disabled in early March due to security concerns, the IRS has been working closely with FSA to safely return the tool to service. ""We know this tool is an easy way for students and families working on applications to access their financial data,"" said IRS Commissioner John Koskinen. ""While this tool provides an important convenience for applicants, we cannot risk the safety of taxpayer data. Protecting taxpayer data has to be the highest priority, and we will continue working with FSA to bring this tool back in a safe and secure manner. ""We have heard from students, parents, and the financial aid community that applying for aid is harder without the DRT,"" said James W. Runcie, Federal Student Aid chief operating officer. ""We will do all we can to help students and families successfully submit applications while the tool is unavailable and remain committed to protecting applicants' personal information."" Options Remain Available for Students, Parents and Borrowers While the Data Retrieval Tool is unavailable, FSA and the IRS remind applicants that online applications are still available and are operable. The income information needed to complete the FAFSA and apply for an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan can be found on a previously filed tax return. Students and parents completing a 2016–17 and 2017–18 FAFSA should manually enter 2015 tax information (not 2016). Borrowers applying for an IDR plan should submit alternative documentation of income to their federal loan servicers after they complete and submit the online IDR application. The process for submitting the alternative documentation of income is explained to borrowers as part of the online IDR application. While the Data Retrieval Tool is unavailable, a borrower may submit a paper copy of his or her tax return, copies of pay stubs or other acceptable forms of documentation explained online during the application process If a copy of the tax return is not readily available, the applicant may be able to access the tax software used to prepare the return or contact their tax preparer to obtain a copy. If necessary, a summary of a previously filed tax return, called a tax transcript, may be viewed and downloaded from www.irs.gov/transcript at Get Transcript Online, with the proper identity verification. Additionally, Get Transcript by Mail can be accessed online , or the taxpayer can call 1-800-908-9946, and a transcript will be delivered to the address of record within five to 10 days. IRS Takes Additional Steps to Protect Taxpayers The IRS is working to identify the number of taxpayers affected by questionable use of the Data Retrieval Tool. Identity thieves may have used personal information obtained outside the tax system to access the FAFSA form in an attempt to secure tax information through the DRT. The IRS continues to review the extent to which this contributed to fraudulently filed tax returns. The IRS has identified instances where our strengthened fraud reviews stopped questionable tax returns by filers who also accessed the DRT. As the IRS identifies taxpayers with personal information at risk through misuse of the data tool, it is marking and locking down those taxpayer accounts to provide additional protection against an identity thief filing a fraudulent tax return. As an internal review continues, the IRS also is finalizing plans to notify affected taxpayers by mail about possible identity theft concerns. The scope of affected taxpayers is still being determined. Additional information for applicants: The online FAFSA and IDR application remain operational. You can continue filing the FAFSA or applying for an IDR plan as you normally would. For more information on or for help with: Completing the FAFSA, visit StudentAid.gov/fafsa or call 1-800-4FED-AID (1-800-433-3243) Applying for an IDR, visit StudentAid.gov/idr .

Title IX prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance. The Title IX probe was based on two complaints filed in July 2011 and April 2013, alleging that the university failed to respond promptly and equitably to reports that the students had been sexually assaulted. OCR's investigation included reviewing the university's policies and procedures, reviewing more than three years of files maintained by the university in its investigation of Title IX complaints, and conducting on-site visits and interviews of students and university staff. Following its investigation, OCR found that the university's violations of Title IX included failing to have policies and procedures that provide for the prompt and equitable resolution of complaints, to treat students equitably when responding to complaints, and to provide a notice of nondiscrimination that is compliant with Title IX. A copy of the resolution letter is posted here and a copy of the agreement can be found here . OCR's mission is to ensure equal access to education and promote educational excellence throughout the nation through the vigorous enforcement of civil rights.

The budget places power in the hands of parents and families to choose schools that are best for their children by investing an additional $1.4 billion in school choice programs. It continues support for the nation’s most vulnerable populations, such as students with disabilities, while streamlining and simplifying funding for college and continuing to help make college education more affordable. “Taxpayers deserve to know their dollars are being spent efficiently and effectively. This budget is the first step in investing in education programs that work, and maintaining our Department’s focus on supporting states and school districts in providing an equal opportunity for a quality education to all students.

Secretary DeVos issued the following statement: ""The updated state template will ensure states are able to better serve students with the freedom and flexibility they deserve, and which Congress requires. My philosophy is simple: I trust parents, I trust teachers, and I trust local school leaders to do what's right for the children they serve. ESSA was passed with broad bipartisan support to move power away from Washington, D.C., and into the hands of those who are closest to serving our nation's students. ""States, along with local educators and parents, are on the frontlines of ensuring every child has access to a quality education. The plans each state develops under the streamlined ESSA template will promote innovation, flexibility and accountability to ensure every child has a chance to learn and succeed."" The updated template ensures greater flexibility for state and local education leaders to do what they know is best for children, while also maintaining important protections for economically disadvantaged students, students with disabilities, and English learners. Crucially, ESSA maintains the transparency and accountability provisions for all students and student subgroups established in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA). The law requires states to help ensure that all students have access to excellent teachers and positive, safe learning environments with necessary supports to prepare them for success in college, a career and life. The streamlined template retains these important components. Releasing a streamlined consolidated state plan template at this time ensures continued accountability for results and provides states a clear path forward on a timeline that works best for them. Secretary DeVos discussed the streamlined template during her remarks to the Council of the Great City Schools this afternoon. The U.S. Department of Education will continue to engage with chief state school officers and governors as state plans proceed through the peer review and secretarial review process.

During OCR's June 2013 proactive investigation of the district's handling of Title IX complaints, OCR received a complaint in March 2014 alleging that the district failed to respond promptly and equitably to reports that students were subjected to sexual harassment.

Under the terms of the resolution agreement, the district has agreed to take actions, including the following: Conduct an investigation to address the deficiencies that OCR identified with respect to the district's response to reports and complaints of violations of Title IX. Review the behavioral incident reports of alleged violations of Title IX at the district's high schools for school years 2012-13 through 2015-16 to determine whether the district responded promptly and equitably to each incident. Revise the district's Title IX policies and procedures to ensure that they provide for prompt and equitable response to reports and complaints of Title IX violations. Develop and implement a confidential online system where students and parents/guardians can make anonymous reports of Title IX.

We are working to resolve the issue as quickly as possible. However, at this time, the IRS anticipates the online data tool will be unavailable for several weeks. This does not limit families' ability to apply for aid. Applicants have other options while the data tool is unavailable. Applicants filling out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and applying for an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan can manually provide the requested financial information from copies of their tax returns. The online FAFSA and IDR application remain operational, and applicants can continue filing the FAFSA or applying for an IDR plan as they normally would. As part of a wider, ongoing effort at the IRS to protect the security of data, the IRS decided to temporarily suspend the Data Retrieval Tool (DRT) as a precautionary step following concerns that information from the tool could potentially be misused by identity thieves. The scope of the issue is being explored, and the IRS and FSA are jointly investigating the issue. At this point, we believe the issue is relatively isolated, and no additional action is needed by taxpayers or people using these applications. The IRS and FSA are actively working on a way to further strengthen the security of information provided by the DRT. We will provide additional information when we have a specific timeframe for returning the DRT or other details to share. Additional information for applicants: The DRT provides tax data that automatically fills in information for part of the FAFSA as well as the IDR plan application. The online FAFSA and IDR application remain operational. You can continue filing the FAFSA or applying for an IDR plan as you normally would. The income information needed to complete the FAFSA and apply for an IDR plan can be found on your tax return. If you did not retain a copy of your tax return, you may be able to access the tax software you used to prepare your return or contact your tax preparer to obtain a copy. If you are unable to get a copy of your tax return, you may visit www.irs.gov/transcript to view and download a summary of your tax return, called a tax transcript, at Get Transcript Online.

Today's discussion at St. Andrew illustrates the transformative and positive impact of school choice. Children should not be denied the right to attend a high-quality school that allows them to pursue the American Dream. I am proud to join President Trump in his efforts to empower all of America's school children — including students from low-income families who are often trapped in underperforming schools — with educational opportunity. We have an obligation to put parents in charge and provide every child with the chance to reach their full potential. Denisha Merriweather, who was able to attend a private school when her public school did not meet her needs, exemplifies the hope and positive impact of school choice, and her story should serve as a model for the nation. For far too long, the one-size-fits-all education system has failed far too many children, and I applaud President Trump's forward-looking vision to put students first. Regardless of the type of school, we must support great schools, great teachers and offer every child an equal opportunity to a great education."

No child, regardless of their ZIP code or family income, should be denied access to quality education. For far too long, Washington has resisted calls by parents, students and teachers to enact meaningful reforms. Tonight’s speech marked a dramatic shift toward a future that puts the needs of our nation’s students first. Together, we can help our nation’s students: those trapped in underperforming schools and those slipping through the cracks. One of those students was Denisha Merriweather, a guest of the First Lady at tonight’s address. Denisha is living proof that school choice can break the cycle of poverty and provide transformative change. As a result of Florida’s Tax Credit Scholarship Program, Denisha became the first in her family to graduate high school, college and later this May, with a master’s degree in social work. Denisha’s story is but one example of the opportunity we should afford to millions of students across our country. I look forward to working with President Trump and Congress to implement the reforms needed to help students learn and thrive. Kids are 100 percent of our future. We owe it to them to give them the education needed to succeed."

Both bills passed Congress with strong bipartisan support and are a testament to the change we can make when we find common ground.

Rather than focus solely on funding, we must be willing to make the tangible, structural reforms that will allow students to reach their full potential. Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) have done this since their founding. They started from the fact that there were too many students in America who did not have equal access to education. They saw that the system wasn't working, that there was an absence of opportunity, so they took it upon themselves to provide the solution. HBCUs are real pioneers when it comes to school choice. They are living proof that when more options are provided to students, they are afforded greater access and greater quality. Their success has shown that more options help students flourish. Their counsel and guidance will be crucial in addressing the current inequities we face in education. I look forward to working with the White House to elevate the role of HBCUs in this administration and to solve the problems we face in education today."

This is not merely a federal mandate, but a moral obligation no individual, school, district or state can abdicate. At my direction, the Department's Office for Civil Rights remains committed to investigating all claims of discrimination, bullying and harassment against those who are most vulnerable in our schools. The guidance issued by the previous administration has given rise to several legal questions. As a result, a federal court in August 2016 issued a nationwide injunction barring the Department from enforcing a portion of its application. Since that time, the Department has not enforced that part of the guidance, thus there is no immediate impact to students by rescinding this guidance. This is an issue best solved at the state and local level. Schools, communities, and families can find – and in many cases have found – solutions that protect all students. I have dedicated my career to advocating for and fighting on behalf of students, and as Secretary of Education, I consider protecting all students, including LGBTQ students, not only a key priority for the Department, but for every school in America.

Good morning! Thank you, Dr. Phelan for the kind introduction and for your leadership at AACC [American Association of Community Colleges]. I have a special appreciation for the work that you, my friend Mary Kay Thayer, and all the representatives from community colleges in the Great Lakes State do each day. My home state is rich in public institutions—more than 30 of them—that primarily award two-year degrees, certificates and other credentials. I'm proud of their record in helping Michiganders to achieve their dreams. I'm also very pleased to note that over the years, I've hired many talented individuals who were graduates of GRCC—Grand Rapids Community College. Supporting students in pursuit of reaching their boundless potential is the mission of every community college leader in this room. I am grateful for the invitation from both your organizations to join you this morning. And, I am humbled and inspired by this opportunity to work together. All of you—presidents, chancellors and trustees, as well as faculty, staff and students who are also attending this summit—have my deepest respect. I'll do my best to earn yours. I've been on the job as Secretary of Education just over a week. While the title and office are new, the work is not all new. My passion and actions have been to help improve educational opportunities for students and parents. And while some have characterized the flurry of attention around my confirmation in negative terms, I viewed it as expressions of passion... passionate parents and advocates who care deeply about their kids and about education. I applaud it, and I know this same passion drives all of you. Community colleges are a uniquely American national asset. You are nimble, inclusive and entrepreneurial. You provide important and valued pathways for students to prepare for success in this competitive economy. You equip students for high-demand fields and skilled jobs that help grow local economies and maintain communities. And, you're absolutely essential engines of workforce and economic development—locally and regionally. You help identify and close the skills gap between employers and job-seekers, so U.S. businesses and industries can thrive and expand. Thanks to you, millions of students have genuine opportunities for a solid education. You offer flexibility and extra support to learners who are balancing responsibilities at home, school, and work—including many who face the very highest obstacles to success. Instead of insisting that students adjust to your schedules and traditions, you adjust to their needs—from employees who seek new skills and credentials to further their careers, to students who need some extra help preparing to do college-level work. With options like night and weekend classes, online courses, child care, academic and career counseling, and part- and full-time programs, community colleges are thoroughly student-centered. And increasingly, you're helping high school students earn college credit and degrees through approaches that are accessible, faster and more affordable than ever. Early college programs are a great example of a unique role played by community colleges. This visionary model allows students, starting as early as ninth grade, to take high school and college courses, and to graduate in five years with a no-cost associate's degree. Some, like Henry Ford Early College in Dearborn, Michigan, are among the state's top-performing high schools. Not only are these students ready for well-paid jobs in fields like health care and advanced manufacturing, but they also can seamlessly continue their education by transferring to a four-year bachelor's degree program. Your institutions, working hand in glove with your business partners, will play an important role in continuing to get Americans back to work. The President was elected to help bring back jobs and economic opportunity, in every region of this country. He has outlined a bold plan to foster the creation of 25 million new American jobs in the next decade and achieve 4 percent annual economic growth. The President's 100-day action plan is his contract with the American voter. This plan notes the importance of expanding vocational and technical education—the types of career and technical education that community colleges excel at providing—and making two- and four-year college degrees more affordable. He has called multiple paths for postsecondary education ""an absolute priority"" for his Administration, and I share that vision. Today is the beginning of what I'm confident will be years of productive collaboration and a healthy exchange of ideas among our nation's colleges and universities, and the Department of Education. I know that there are many items on your legislative agenda, from reauthorization of the Higher Education Act and the Perkins Act, to ways community colleges can help transform the nation's infrastructure, to allowing Pell Grants to have flexibility in supporting students working to graduate more quickly. And in the days ahead, I'll look forward to hearing your thoughts and working with you as President Trump's vision continues taking shape. I also know that there are local and state-based initiatives this Administration can learn about and highlight, including the early college programs I've mentioned. As you know, the Department provides many resources for community colleges through our Office of Career, Technical, and Adult Education, including information about grant opportunities, veterans' resources, promising practices, and more. You can find these resources on our website, ed.gov, and we'll be adding information as new initiatives develop. Thank you once again for the warm welcome. I and our team at the Department look forward to working with and to sharing thoughts on how we can implement the President's goals and accomplish a shared vision for education. It is a great honor to stand with you in this work. I am encouraged and excited by what we can achieve together for America's students and families, and for this nation that we love."

Good Afternoon: Thank you for that kind introduction Todd, and thank you for inviting me to be here with you. I want to begin by expressing my appreciation for all you do. I would like to share some thoughts on how I hope to support your important work, but first, let me just comment on something you may have seen on TV. Last Friday, a handful of protestors tried to block my entrance into Jefferson Middle School Academy here in D.C. While I eventually made it in, and had very constructive conversations with Chancellor Wilson, many DC administrative leaders, some terrific teachers and Principal Dohmann, the protestors' behavior is a reflection of the way some seek to treat our education system – by keeping kids in and new thinking out. Friday's incident demonstrates just how hostile some people are to change and to new ideas. Without realizing it, we, too, can fall victim to this trap of seeing our work in education as an ""us vs. them"" approach. I know this to be true throughout the reform community, where there are those who claim to be champions of education, but they really only support their respective ""sectors."" These silos are unnecessary and unproductive in our common goal to serve all students. So I applaud your work to expand and improve options for all children through magnet schools. The education of a child is not a zero-sum game. When a student excels academically, we do not place an asterisk next to his or her name based on the type of school he or she attends. I want to encourage you today to look beyond the walls of your schools, beyond the invisible lines of your community, and let's renew our commitment to doing what's best for each and every child. A quick question: By a show of hands, who here got involved in education to make money? (If you did, I'm not judging you) ... I don't see any hands up. Who here got involved because you don't trust teachers? Again, no hands. Okay, last one. Who here today got involved in education because you care deeply about students and their needs? Now all of you have raised your hand. Our care for students and their futures is what brings us together. This is the common element that makes our mission so noble: Our collective goal is to provide all students with an equal opportunity for a high-quality education. I don't need to recite the history of magnet schools and the vital role they've played to improve the lives of urban students, combat segregation, and provide a quality option to parents and kids alike. Indeed, magnet schools are often referred to as the original school choice option. I've seen the evidence firsthand. In my hometown of Grand Rapids, Michigan, City High Middle School is nationally recognized and is ranked the third-best school in the state. Forty-five percent are minority students, and 98 percent of all students are enrolled in IB programs. In conversations with parents and students who are part of City High, it's clear how much they appreciate and value the opportunity that school provides. After 40 years since the inception of magnet schools, I think it's important to celebrate their important role and also to remind ourselves that there's so much more work to be done. That is why I am honored to join you today. Your presence demonstrates your commitment to creating quality options, to embracing innovation, and to seeking new ways to better serve some of our most underserved students. Let's also celebrate the fact that more than 2.6 million students benefit from attending 3,285 magnet schools. These schools are offering parents tremendous options, and they offer students an important opportunity they wouldn't have had elsewhere. I applaud your commitment to developing and communicating best practices to ensure all magnet schools strive to be models of excellence. I'm proud to highlight the Department's Magnet Schools Assistance Program (MSAP), and note that the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) offers new flexibilities that will hopefully lead to greater program success. First, ESSA extends the grant term from three years to up to five years, and increases the maximum cumulative grant award from $12 million to $15 million. Grantees will now have more time and funding to implement their themes, diversify their schools and improve academic outcomes. Second, ESSA allows grant funds to be spent on transportation for your school's students, thereby improving access to new, thriving magnet schools for all students. And third, ESSA allows your schools to measure diversity by both socioeconomic background as well as race. But the reality is: What makes your schools transformative places of learning is not a federal grant; it's not the brick and mortar, it's you, the human connection. You and your teachers are the difference-makers and the life-changers. The relationships you forge with your students give them a platform from which to launch. As the Secretary of Education, I am committed to supporting your success, celebrating your commitment to quality, and working with you to ensure that magnet schools continue to play a vital role in bettering student achievements. Please know, I am the type of person who listens more than she speaks, so know that my door is open to you, to hear your concerns, and to help you build on your achievements. Thank you again for everything you do for America's children. I appreciate you, and I know the parents and students you serve do as well. I wish you a very successful conference and visit to our nation's capital. Thanks very much."
