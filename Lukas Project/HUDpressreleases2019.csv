Read FHA Commissioner Brian Montgomery's letter to lenders and approved mortgagees.
FHA approved mortgagees and lenders are reminded of their ongoing obligation to offer special forbearance to borrowers experiencing loss of income.
FHA expects all approved mortgagees and lenders to make every effort to communicate with and assist affected borrowers to the greatest extent possible by:
extending special forbearance plans to borrowers impacted by the shutdown, and fully evaluating borrowers for available loss mitigation options to avoid foreclosure whenever possible.

In a resignation letter to Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, Bright wrote:
The opportunity to serve the country and our economy in this capacity has been a tremendous honor... I am incredibly proud of what we have accomplished since early 2017. As you are aware, over the past two years, Ginnie Mae's total outstanding portfolio crossed the $2 trillion mark, and last year we served 1.9 million American families as they purchased or refinanced a home. This would not have taken place without the dedication and leadership of the Ginnie Mae staff, who are some of the most knowledgeable and mission-focused professionals I have ever worked with.
""I want to thank Michael for his many contributions to Ginnie Mae over the last two years,"" said Secretary Carson. ""He has assembled a first-rate team and successfully managed and expanded a portfolio that enables millions of Americans to become homeowners each year. We wish him the best in his future.""
Maren Kasper, current Executive Vice President of Ginnie Mae, will serve as the Acting President upon Bright's departure. Kasper joined Ginnie Mae in June 2017.
As announced (https://ginniemae.gov/newsroom/Pages/PressReleaseDispPage.aspx?ParamID=149) on December 22, 2018, during a lapse in government funding, Ginnie Mae will continue to remit timely payment of principal and interest to investors.

HUD's Continuum of Care grants will provide critically needed support to 5,800 local programs on the front lines of serving individuals and families experiencing homelessness. View a complete list of all the state and local homeless projects awarded funding (www.hudexchange.info/programs/coc/awards/).
HUD is today announcing renewal funding for previously funded local programs. The agency will announce new project awards at a later date.
""At this time of year, thousands of local homeless assistance providers receive federal funding to operate and maintain stable housing for those living in our shelter system and on our streets,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""Renewing these grants will come as a huge relief to these providers, and it will allow them to continue their work to house and serve our most vulnerable neighbors.""
HUD Continuum of Care grant funding supports a broad array of interventions designed to assist individuals and families experiencing homelessness, particularly those living in places not meant for habitation, located in sheltering programs, or at imminent risk of becoming homeless. Each year, HUD serves more than a million people through emergency shelter, transitional, and permanent housing programs.
HUD continues to challenge state and local planning organizations called ""Continuums of Care"" to support their highest performing local programs that have proven most effective in meeting the needs of persons experiencing homelessness in their communities. Many of these state and local planners also embraced HUD's call to shift funds from existing underperforming projects to create new ones that are based on best practices that will further their efforts to prevent and end homelessness.
Last December, local communities reported homelessness in the U.S. remained largely unchanged in 2018. Based upon these local reports, HUD's 2018 Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress (www.hudexchange.info/resources/documents/2018-AHAR-Part-1.pdf) found that 552,830 persons experienced homelessness on a single night in 2018, an increase of 0.3 percent since 2017. The number of families with children experiencing homelessness declined 2.7 percent since 2017 and 29 percent since 2010. Local communities also reported a continuing trend in reducing veteran homelessness across the country - the number of veterans experiencing homelessness fell 5.4 percent since January 2017 and by 49 percent since 2010.

Read the agreement.
""The families who have endured unimaginably poor housing conditions deserve better from their housing authority,"" said Secretary Carson. ""Today we are presenting NYCHA residents with bold new solutions for decades-old problems.""
The agreement, made under the authority of Secretary Carson and not subject to court approval, establishes specific requirements and milestones to address the serious health and safety hazards at NYCHA properties, including lead-based paint, mold, heat, vermin, among others. It also recognizes the existence of a substantial default by NYCHA but does not impose a receiver.
As part of the agreement, the City is committing at least $2.2 billion in funding over the next 10 years to address these issues. HUD will continue to provide funding to NYCHA, which is estimated to be $1.5 billion this year.
The agreement also establishes a federal monitor selected by HUD and the Southern District of New York (SDNY) with input from the City. The monitor will submit quarterly reports to HUD and SDNY, which will be made publicly available. The City will pay the cost of the monitor in addition to its other financial commitments. The parties expect to announce the monitor in the near future.
In addition, the plan meets the following key principles as required by HUD in December 2018 when Secretary Carson agreed to work with Mayor Bill de Blasio to reach an agreement to avoid receivership:
A sustainable commitment to decent, safe and sanitary affordable housing using all tools available Setting specific performance targets for lead, mold, elevator, heat and vermin issues Robust oversight to assure remediation objectives are met Milestones for measuring meaningful progress toward remediation goals and other institutional improvements at NYCHA Reduction of unwarranted costs and elimination of bureaucratic impediments to efficient operations Management of the highest quality and commitment Local control of day-to-day operations by NYCHA and New York City Strong remedies that are immediately available to address any future failure to perform, whether in the case of individuals or organizational structures Commitment of all relevant emergency powers available to NYCHA by New York City and New York State Commitment of additional financial resources from New York City and New York State for remediation and future sustainability
• A sustainable commitment to decent, safe and sanitary affordable housing using all tools available
• Setting specific performance targets for lead, mold, elevator, heat and vermin issues
• Robust oversight to assure remediation objectives are met
• Milestones for measuring meaningful progress toward remediation goals and other institutional improvements at NYCHA
• Reduction of unwarranted costs and elimination of bureaucratic impediments to efficient operations

• Commitment of all relevant emergency powers available to NYCHA by New York City and New York State
• Commitment of additional financial resources from New York City and New York State for remediation and future sustainability
""This is a very positive outcome, one that I believe can bring meaningful change to living conditions of the many thousands of families who depend upon NYCHA for their housing,"" said Secretary Carson. ""But there is still a lot of work to be carried out. We look forward to continuing what has been a productive working relationship with the Mayor and his team. HUD will continue to advocate for the hundreds of thousands of children, women and men in New York City whose lives and livelihoods depend on having safe, fair and affordable housing. They deserve nothing less."""

EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take three months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, six months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2 percent) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percentage change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percentage changes are 90 percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percentage changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised 3 percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at the Census Bureau's website (www.census.gov/construction/nrs/how_the_data_are_collected/index.html).
* The 90 percent confidence interval includes zero. In such cases, there is insufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero."

02/14/2019:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2019/pr19-010.cfm,HUD Awards $74 Million to Help Families Reach Self-Sufficiency,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson today awarded $74 million to hundreds of public housing authorities across the country to continue helping public housing residents participating in the Housing Choice Voucher Program and/or reside in public housing to increase their earned income and reduce their dependency on public assistance and rental subsidies. Read more about the local impact of the grants announced today.
These grants renew HUD's support of 688 public housing authorities through the Department's Family Self-Sufficiency (FSS)) program. HUD's FSS program helps local public housing authorities hire service coordinators who work directly with residents to connect them with programs and services that already exist in the local community. The FSS program encourages innovative strategies that link housing assistance with a broad spectrum of services that will enable participating families to find jobs, increase earned income, reduce or eliminate the need for rental and/or welfare assistance, and make progress toward achieving economic independence and housing self-sufficiency.
""One of the most important things we can do as public servants is to help HUD-assisted families achieve their dreams,"" said Secretary Carson. ""Working with our local partners, HUD is connecting families to educational opportunities, job training, childcare and other resources that allow them to get higher paying jobs and, ultimately, become self-sufficient.""
FSS participants sign a five-year contract that requires the head of the household to obtain employment and that no member of the household will receive certain types of public assistance at the end of the five-year term. These families have an interest-bearing escrow account established for them. The amount credited to the family's escrow account is based on increases in the family's earned income during the term of the FSS contract. If the family successfully completes its FSS contract, the family receives the escrow funds that it can use for any purpose, including debt reduction to improve credit scores, educational expenses, or a down payment on a home.
The average household income of FSS participants nearly tripled during their time in the program, from $10,000 at the time of entry to more than $27,000 upon program completion."
02/15/2019:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2019/pr19-011.cfm,HUD Announces $10 Million in 'Sweat Equity' Grants,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today awarded $10 million in ""sweat equity"" grants to support four non-profit, self-help housing organizations that enable homeownership opportunities for hard-working, low-income families and individuals. Funded through HUD's Self-Help Homeownership Opportunity Program (SHOP), the grants awarded today, along with the labor contributed by the homebuyers and numerous volunteers, will significantly lower the cost of homeownership.
""Advancing economic opportunity for low-income families is a top priority of mine at HUD, and one that the department is carrying out through terrific programs like SHOP,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""These grants, along with the support of our partners, will enable homeownership opportunities for hundreds of deserving families.""
The following organizations will receive SHOP funds (see individual descriptions below):
The SHOP program provides federal grants on a competitive basis to national and regional non-profit organizations and consortia that have experience in administering self-help homeownership housing programs. The SHOP grants must be used to purchase land and make necessary infrastructure improvements, which together may not exceed an average SHOP investment of $15,000 per dwelling unit. Leveraged funds must be used for the construction or rehabilitation of these homeownership units.
Homebuyers will contribute significant sweat equity toward the development of their units and/or the units of other homebuyers participating in the local self-help housing programs. These sweat equity contributions reduce the purchase price of the SHOP units and make these units affordable for low-income homebuyers. A minimum of 100 sweat equity hours is required from a household of two or more persons. A minimum of 50 sweat equity hours is required from a household of one person. Community participation consisting of volunteer labor contributions is also required. Sweat equity and volunteer labor may include, but are not limited to, landscaping, foundation work, painting, carpentry, trim work, drywall, roofing and siding for the housing. Reasonable accommodations must be made for persons with disabilities.
Grantees may carry out activities directly and/or distribute SHOP funds to local non-profit affiliates that will develop the SHOP units, select homebuyers, coordinate the homebuyer sweat equity and volunteer efforts, and assist in the arrangement of interim and permanent financing for the homebuyers. The grantees ensure that the new homebuyers can afford their homes at the time of purchase and for the long term. Many of the SHOP homebuyers are first-time homeowners and come from underserved groups
Since 1996, when Congress first appropriated SHOP funds, the SHOP program has provided more than $396 million in federal grants that, together with significant leveraged funds and numerous volunteer hours, are transforming lives and neighborhoods through the production of over 28,500 units of affordable, homeownership housing."
02/20/2019:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2019/pr19-012.cfm,HUD Awards $10.6 Million to Help Low-Income Public Housing Residents Secure Higher Paying Jobs,"WASHINGTON - To help low-income public housing residents increase their income and move toward self-sufficiency, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today awarded $10.6 million to four Public Housing Authorities (PHAs). HUD's Jobs Plus Initiative connects public housing residents with employment, education and financial empowerment services—a proven model to help public housing residents find and keep better paying jobs. Read more about how these local housing agencies will put these funds to work.
HUD Secretary Ben Carson made the grant announcement today in the Watts neighborhood in Los Angeles during a site visit of the Nickerson Gardens public housing development.
""These investments help public housing residents reach their dreams,"" said Secretary Ben Carson. ""The idea is simple-connect families with educational opportunities, job training and other services so they can find better paying jobs and achieve self-sufficiency.""
HUD's Jobs Plus grants are awarded to the following public housing authorities:
HUD's Jobs Plus Initiative combines traditional employment, training and job placement services with a rent incentive and a place-based investment in building ""community support for work."" The program addresses poverty among public housing residents and creates a culture of work and makes working families the norm.
Jobs Plus services are tailored to residents' individual needs and are drawn from a menu of on-site and referral services. For unemployed residents, case managers will help identify short and long-term employment goals and create plans to accomplish them. Employed individuals can work with case managers to take the necessary steps to advance in the labor market."
02/20/2019:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2019/pr19-013.cfm,HUD to Drastically Cut Notice for Inspections of Public Housing and Privately Owned Apartment Buildings,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced it is dramatically reducing the advance notice it provides to public housing authorities (PHAs) and private owners of HUD-subsidized apartment developments before their housing is inspected to ensure it is decent, safe and healthy. HUD's new standard provides PHAs and private owners of HUD-assisted housing 14 calendar days' notice before an inspection, a dramatic reduction from the current notice which can frequently extend up to four months. Read HUD's notice.
In addition, HUD is launching a series of listening sessions around the nation to gather input from the public and HUD stakeholders about a planned pilot program to test innovative new approaches to inspecting HUD-assisted properties. Initial listening sessions are planned in Philadelphia, Fort Worth, Atlanta, Detroit and Seattle.
Currently, HUD's Real Estate Assessment Center (REAC) provides advance notice before a scheduled inspection which frequently extends up to 120 days. This amount of lead time allows certain public housing authorities and property owners to undertake cosmetic, 'just-in-time' repairs to their properties rather than adopting year-round maintenance practices.
""It's become painfully clear to us that too many public housing authorities and private landlords whom we contract with were using the weeks before their inspection to make quick fixes, essentially gaming the system,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""The action we take today is part of a broader review of our inspections so we can be true to the promise of providing housing that's decent, safe and healthy to the millions of families we serve.""
Today's notice is part of a wholesale reexamination of REAC's inspection process that Secretary Carson launched shortly after taking office. HUD will be consulting with PHAs and property owners over the next several months to discuss other improvements to REAC's process.
REAC is responsible for inspecting properties owned and operated by approximately 3,700 local public housing authorities nationwide. In addition, REAC-contracted inspectors evaluate approximately 23,000 privately owned apartment buildings. Combined, approximately 96 percent of these properties pass their inspections.
Still, it has been HUD's observation that many public housing authorities and private owners of HUD-subsidized housing have grown accustomed to REAC's 20-year-old inspection regime and, in some cases, invest more resources in passing minimal inspection requirements rather than satisfying their obligation to provide quality housing.
Beginning 30 days after publication of this notice, HUD employees and contract inspectors acting on behalf of HUD shall provide property owners and their agents 14 calendar days of notice prior to their inspection. If an owner/agent declines, cancels or refuses entry for an inspection, a presumptive score of ""0"" (zero) will be recorded. If the second attempt results in a successful inspection within seven calendar days, the resulting score will be recorded.

02/21/2019:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2019/pr19-014.cfm,FHA Expands Pilot Program to Accelerate Financing of Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Projects,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson today announced a significant expansion of a Federal Housing Administration (FHA) pilot program that streamlines FHA mortgage insurance applications for affordable housing developments that have equity from the sale of Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) Program, the nation's primary source of affordable housing production. Read FHA's Notice.
Secretary Carson made the announcement at the National Association of Homebuilders International Builders' Show.
In 2012, FHA launched a pilot program to streamline FHA mortgage insurance applications for projects with equity from the sale of LIHTC, specifically applications to refinance mortgage debt under FHA's Section 223(f) Program. Today, FHA is expanding this pilot program to include new construction and substantial rehabilitation under its Section 221(d)(4) and Section 220 Programs.
""Today, we take another important step to stimulate capital investment in affordable housing at a time when we need affordable housing more than ever,"" said Secretary Carson. ""We're also applying the lessons we've learned from our earlier pilot program to streamline our processing for new construction and substantial rehabilitation developments, so we can get these deals done quicker and more efficiently.""
FHA's expanded pilot program will ensure faster and more efficient processing for low-risk, LIHTC transactions by eliminating redundant reviews. Average processing time for LIHTC deals is currently 90 days. Under FHA's pilot, processing times are reduced to 30 days under the Expedited Approval Process track and 60 days under the Standard Approval Process track. A shorter application review period allows borrowers to lock in better interest rates sooner, an important capability in a rising interest rate environment.
Today's action further aligns FHA's policies and underwriting towards supporting affordable housing production and preservation. FHA multifamily transactions that include Low-Income Housing Tax Credits account for approximately 30 percent of FHA's total multifamily volume. By aligning FHA's Section 221(d) and Section 220 programs with LIHTC Program, it's expected FHA will support more production and preservation of critically needed affordable multifamily housing.
The new expanded pilot will also encourage long-term investments in low-income urban and rural communities and supports development in Opportunity Zones. Opportunity Zones are census tracts in low-income communities experiencing economic distress. In July 2018, the Internal Revenue Service published this list (www.irs.gov/pub/irs-irbs/irb18-28.pdf) of more than 8,700 qualified opportunity zones in the 50 states and U.S. territories."
02/22/2019:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2019/pr19-015.cfm,HUD Announces New Monitor to Help New York City Housing Authority Address Chronic Housing Problems,"NEW YORK - U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson today announced its intent to select Bart M. Schwartz to serve as the federal monitor to ensure the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) satisfies the conditions of a recently announced agreement to correct chronically poor housing conditions endured by its residents.
Schwartz is currently chairman of Guidepost Solutions, LLC (www.guidepostsolutions.com/our-experts/bart-schwartz/), and formerly served as a trial lawyer and Chief of SDNY's Criminal Division where he led prosecutions involving financial and business fraud, organized crime, narcotics, and other types of criminal activity. In his role as monitor, Schwartz will observe NYCHA's key operations, especially as they relate to lead safety, heat, pest control, and elevators, submit quarterly reports to HUD and SDNY, and engage with NYCHA's residents.
""We've found the person with the perfect experience to work with the nation's largest public housing authority under our agreement to reverse the chronic housing problems that for far too long have plagued hundreds of thousands of families,"" said HUD Secretary Carson. ""With Mr. Schwartz's appointment, NYCHA can move full steam ahead on an action plan to improve the deplorable housing conditions being endured by its residents.""
Schwartz added, ""I look forward to working to achieve living conditions for NYCHA residents that are decent, safe, and sanitary. The Agreement serves as a blueprint that sets out my duties and responsibilities for achieving those goals.""
After decades of failing to address poor living conditions, NYCHA agreed that a more robust federal role was appropriate. The recently announced agreement, signed by HUD Secretary Ben Carson and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, increases federal oversight but gives New York City the opportunity to save NYCHA from being placed into receivership by the federal government.
As Schwartz begins his role as NYCHA's monitor, HUD will continue to provide the housing agency $1.5 billion this year or $28.8 million a week. In addition, New York City is committing to invest at least $2.2 billion over the next 10 years to address NYCHA's longstanding issues. The State of New York has also announced financial support."

The recovery plan HUD is approving today will further assist the state's $5 billion HUD-funded recovery programs the Department approved last June.
Secretary Carson and Texas Governor Greg Abbott made the announcement following a meeting today in Washington. Texas submitted the latest recovery plan for HUD's review which primarily focuses on the restoration of damaged and destroyed homes, businesses and infrastructure. Read Texas' recovery plan (http://recovery.texas.gov/public-notices/files/ap/5b-ap-amendment-2-public-comment.pdf).
Texas' long-term recovery is supported through HUD's Community Development Block Grant—Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) Program which requires grantees to develop thoughtful recovery plans informed by local residents. Learn more about CDBG-DR and the State's role in long-term disaster recovery (en español) (www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lrmwz8IXXdQ&feature=youtu.be).
""Today, we're taking another important step along the path to recovery for hard-hit areas in East Texas,"" said Secretary Carson. ""HUD is committed to working alongside Texans to rebuild their homes, restore their businesses and repair their critical infrastructure.""
Governor Abbott said, ""I am grateful to Secretary Carson for his tremendous partnership throughout the recovery and ongoing rebuilding process and for his leadership from the very beginning. With these funds, Texas will do more than rebuild. We will rebuild our communities stronger and more resilient than before.""
Background
Shortly after Hurricane Harvey in 2017, HUD quickly provided the State of Texas $57.8 million to begin long-term recovery in hard-hit areas. In 2018, HUD followed this initial investment with another $5 billion in CDBG-DR funding to the Lone Star State. Informed by local citizens, Texas developed recovery plans for these allocations which HUD approved last year (read more).
Today's action approves the State's third allocation of $652,175,000. Combined, HUD is investing more than $5.7 billion to address the remaining needs of Texans following Hurricane Harvey.
CDBG-DR grants support a variety of disaster recovery activities including housing redevelopment and rebuilding, business assistance, economic revitalization, and infrastructure repair. Grantees are required to spend the majority of these recovery funds in the ""most impacted"" areas as identified by HUD, including the City of Houston, Harris County and other hard-hit areas throughout East Texas."

HUD's approval of the action plan makes Puerto Rico eligible for Congressionally appropriated disaster relief funds which will be awarded through HUD grant programs.
""This is an unprecedented investment and since Puerto Rico has a history of fiscal malfeasance, we are putting additional financial controls in place to ensure this disaster recovery money is spent properly,"" said Secretary Carson. ""With stringent HUD oversight, these dollars should have a real, lasting impact on Puerto Rico and help our fellow citizens who are struggling to recover from these devastating storms.""
As a result of the Administration's serious concerns over Puerto Rico's past fiscal irregularities, and to ensure that all disaster relief funds will be spent in a manner that helps the citizens of Puerto Rico, HUD will impose strict conditions and financial controls on the use of the funds. This heightened scrutiny will include enhanced monitoring of expenditures and other measures designed to ensure Puerto Rico's legal and prudent use of the funds.

03/05/2019:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2019/pr19-020.cfm,HUD Approves Agreement Resolving Allegations of Housing Discrimination Involving San Francisco Housing Providers,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced the approval of a Conciliation Agreement with a landlord and agent in San Francisco, CA, resolving allegations that they refused to rent to a tenant with disabilities because he had an emotional support animal. Read the agreement.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from denying housing to persons with disabilities and from refusing to make reasonable accommodations in policies or practices, which includes denying assistance animal requests.
""Assistance animals provide persons with disabilities with the support they need to not only enjoy their home, but to function in life,"" said Anna María Farías, Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Today's agreement reflects HUD's ongoing commitment to ensuring that housing providers abide by our nation's fair housing laws.""
The case came to HUD's attention when an individual with disabilities filed a complaint alleging that he was denied the opportunity to rent an apartment because he had an emotional support animal. HUD's investigation found the landlord and agent were explicitly informed that the prospective tenant's animal is prescribed by a doctor and allowed under fair housing laws, but they still refused to consider his tenancy because of the animal.
Under the terms of the agreement, the owner will pay the complainant $9,000 and both respondents will attend fair housing training.
Persons who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY)."

Read the Consent Order.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to discriminate in housing because of race, national origin, and familial status.
""Denying a family housing because of their ethnicity of familial makeup not only robs them of a place to call home, it violates the law,"" said Anna María Farías, Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Today's announcement reaffirms HUD's commitment to protecting the housing rights of families and ensuring that all landlords comply with the Fair Housing Act.""
""The Fair Housing Act is a key part of protecting the American dream,"" said Paul Compton, HUD's General Counsel. ""This settlement represents an important step in HUD's continuing effort to vigorously protect the rights of families and persons of all races and national origins to be free from housing discrimination across the country.""
HUD filed a charge of discrimination in the case in August 2018 after the owners of the rental home refused to rent the six-bedroom residence to the multi-generational family. HUD's charge alleged that the owners and real-estate broker discouraged the family from renting the home by offering them less favorable rental terms, including increasing the requested monthly rent by $1,000.
Under the terms of the Consent Order, the respondents will pay $74,000 to the families impacted; place a fair-housing advertisement in the local newspaper; and the real-estate broker will take fair housing and multicultural-sensitivity training.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in housing because of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, disability and familial status. People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY).

The agreement resolves allegations that Downs, LLC and EMNA Management, Inc., the owner and manager of the development, refused to remediate mold at the property as a reasonable accommodation for a couple with disabilities and retaliated against them for asking that the mold be removed. Read the agreement.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to discriminate in the sale, rental, and financing of dwellings, and in other housing-related transactions, based on disability. This includes refusing to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, services or facilities related to housing.
""Reasonable accommodation requests aren't requests for special treatment. They are what many individuals with disabilities need to live in the place they call home,"" said Anna María Farías, Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Hopefully, today's settlement will help housing providers to better understand their responsibilities under the Fair Housing Act and take steps to meet them.""
The case came to HUD's attention when a couple with disabilities filed a complaint alleging that the owner and management company for their apartment building refused to remove mold that was present in the building, as the couple had requested. The couple also alleged that the owners retaliated against them for making the reasonable accommodation request by increasing their rent and issuing the couple a termination of lease notice. The residents moved out after receiving the notice.
Under the terms of the agreement, the owner and property manager will pay the couple $6,000, require their employees to take fair housing training, and adopt a fair housing policy that includes reasonable accommodation guidance, which will be distributed to all leasing and management staff and property tenants.

Secretary Carson made the grant announcement today during an event with Waco Mayor, Kyle Deaver and city leaders. The City of Waco, a new grantee, will address lead hazards in over 140 housing units in the community to provide safer homes for very low-income families with children.
""We're proud to be here with the City of Waco and Mayor Deaver today as they take another important step towards creating safer and healthier homes for the most vulnerable families and children in their community,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""These grants will help the city eliminate lead-based paint and other health hazards from low-income households and ensure they live in safe and reliable homes.""
These grants are provided through HUD's Lead-Based Paint Hazard Control and Lead-Based Paint and Lead Hazard Reduction Demonstration grant programs to identify and clean up dangerous lead in low-income housing.
These investments will protect families and children by targeting health hazards in low-income homes with significant lead and health hazards. HUD's lead hazard control grant programs have successfully filled critical needs for remediating housing hazards, focusing on the most vulnerable residents of communities with limited local resources to address these hazards.
HUD, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Health and Human Services, through the Federal Action Plan to Reduce Childhood Lead Exposure (www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2018-12/documents/fedactionplan_lead_final.pdf), are working collaboratively to diminish childhood exposure to lead from lead-based paint and other sources.
HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes promotes local efforts to eliminate dangerous lead paint and other housing-related health hazards from lower income homes; stimulates private sector investment in lead hazard control; supports cutting-edge research on methods for assessing and controlling housing-related health and safety hazards; and educates the public about the dangers of hazards in the home."

EXPLANATORY NOTES
Data collection and processing were delayed for this indicator release due to the lapse in federal funding from December 22, 2018 through January 25, 2019. While response rates were consistent with normal levels, delays in data collection could make it more difficult to determine exact start and completion dates. However, processing and data quality were monitored and no systematic issues were identified.
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take three months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, six months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2 percent) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percentage change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percentage changes are 90 percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percentage changes shown in the tables.

03/11/2019:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2019/pr19-026.cfm,HUD Announces Agreement Resolving Allegations of Discrimination Involving San Diego Housing Providers,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced it has entered into a Conciliation/Voluntary Compliance Agreement with a resident and owners of a San Diego apartment complex.
The agreement resolves allegations that Wakeland Atmosphere, L.P., and FPI Management, Inc., the owners and managers of Atmosphere Apartments, refused to grant the resident's request for a designated parking space close to the building. Read the agreement.
The Fair Housing Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act prohibit housing providers from denying or limiting housing to persons with disabilities and from refusing to make reasonable accommodations in policies or practices.
""To a person with mobility limitations, a designated parking space can mean the difference between merely living in a development and truly being able to call a place home,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will continue working to ensure that housing providers meet their obligation to grant the reasonable accommodations persons with disabilities need and are entitled to under the law.""
The case came to HUD's attention when the resident, who uses a wheelchair, filed a complaint alleging that his request for an assigned parking space in the development's garage had been denied. The resident alleged that the owners and manager subsequently allowed him to park in non-assigned accessible spaces in the garage, but denied him the key that is necessary to enter the garage and to use the elevator. As a result, each time the resident wanted to enter the garage, he allegedly had to wait for another resident to open the gate, then follow that person in so he could use the elevator. The housing providers deny that they discriminated against the resident.
Under the terms of the Agreement, the owners and manager will pay the resident $17,000, modify their fair housing policy to include information about reasonable accommodations, comply with the provisions of Section 504 of the 1973 Rehabilitation Act, and attend fair housing training.
Persons who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY)."
03/11/2019:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2019/pr19-027.cfm,Trump Administration Proposes 2020 HUD Budget,"WASHINGTON - The Trump Administration today announced its proposed Fiscal Year 2020 Budget for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), a $44.1 billion spending plan that expands resources to prevent/end homelessness; invests record funding to reduce lead and other home health and safety hazards; and preserves rental assistance to HUD-assisted households.
The President's Budget continues a commitment to fiscal restraint, targeting lower value HUD programs for elimination or reduction, while seeking stable or increased funding into the highest impact programs that provide housing and support for vulnerable populations. Read HUD's proposed FY 2020 Budget on HUD's website.
""This Budget advances our key priorities, including empowering HUD-assisted families to achieve self-sufficiency,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""For generations, the idea of the Federal Government providing housing assistance meant only one thing-helping to pay the rent so families can have a roof over their heads. But we must also think about how we can help families to access financial programs, educational opportunities, and higher paying jobs. In short, we must think beyond investing in bricks and mortar, and think about investing in people.""
ENDING HOMELESSNESS
The 2020 Budget continues the Federal goal to prevent and end homelessness by seeking nearly $2.6 billion to support thousands of local housing and service programs assisting those living in the nation's sheltering system and on the streets. This represents a $215 million or 9 percent increase over the Administration's 2019 budget request.
PROMOTING HEALTHY HOMES
To protect families and their young children from potentially dangerous lead-based paint and other home health and safety hazards, the Administration is seeking a combined $290 million for HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes. This request doubles the investment the Administration sought last year and represents a historic contribution to State and local governments as they work to remove lead hazards from homes occupied by low-income families with young children who are especially at-risk.
CONTINUING RENT ASSISTANCE
The Budget continues support for 4.7 million HUD-assisted households by increasing rental assistance to $37.9 billion, maintaining support to all current participating households. This request includes $22.2 billion for HUD's Housing Choice Voucher Program which will allow local Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) to maintain support to approximately 2.2 million families nationwide and represents a 7.6 percent increase over the Administration's 2019 request. The request also includes $12 billion to renew rental subsidies to privately owned multifamily housing developments through the Project-based Rental Assistance (PBRA)Program, a $874 million increase over the President's 2019 budget.
The 2020 Budget proposes $644 million for the Housing for the Elderly (Section 202) and $157 million for the Housing for Persons with Disabilities (Section 811) programs. These requested amounts represent an increase of $43 million and $17 million respectively over the President's 2019 budget request.
PURSUING RENT REFORM
The current rent structure in HUD's rental assistance programs creates disincentives to employment; imposes large administrative burdens for Public Housing Authorities (PHAs), private owners, and tenants. The Administration believes this structure generates significant and increasing costs to the Federal Government and represents a one-size-fits-all approach that adequately consider local community needs. With the Making Affordable Housing Work Act (MAHWA), submitted to Congress in April 2018, HUD proposed to reform rental assistance to address these issues.
The Budget incorporates the proposed reforms, which promote work, simplify program administration, reduce Federal costs, and increase local choice. These reforms include increased tenant rent contributions for those able to work (not including elderly/disabled households); reduced frequency of income recertifications; and additional flexibilities for public housing authorities and property owners to develop alternative rent structures. In addition, the Budget proposes uniform work for work-able households, while exempting the elderly, the disabled, those caring for a disabled family member or small child, and pregnant women.
PUBLIC HOUSING
HUD estimates that the nation's public housing stock is experiencing a backlog of billions of dollars in capital needs resulting in the loss of thousands of affordable units each year due to severe disrepair. The cumbersome regulatory structure of the Public Housing program limits local Public Housing Agencies' (PHAs) ability to adequately address their significant needs. The budget again proposes to merge the Public Housing Capital Fund into the Public Housing Operating Fund with reduced overall funding. This new combined Operating Fund will be given extra flexibilities to pay for capital improvement needs. This better supports local needs by allowing increased flexibility for each PHA to make decisions that best serve their residents.
Meanwhile, HUD will work with local PHAs to shift public housing units to a more sustainable financing model and to allow State and local governments to take a more active role to support these functions. One of these more sustainable models is HUD Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD). Given the scarcity of federal funds and the substantial capital needs of the nation's aging public housing stock, the Administration proposes removing the statutory limit on the number of public housing units that can participate in RADwhich, to date, has preserved more than 100,000 units of affordable housing that would otherwise have been lost permanently.
SUPPORTING HOMEOWNERSHIP AND FAIR HOUSING
The 2020 Budget continues to support homeownership through the FHA mortgage insurance programs, providing up to $400 billion in new single-family loan guarantee authority that includes critical funding to support targeted improvements to FHA's aging information technology systems, some of which are based upon the outdated COBOL programming language. In addition, the budget requests up to $30 billion in new loan guarantee authority for FHA's multifamily, hospital and healthcare mortgage insurance programs.
To further support homeownership opportunities, the Budget seeks $550 billion in new guarantee authority for Ginnie Mae, a part of HUD. Ginnie Mae makes affordable housing a reality for millions of low- and moderate-income households across America by channeling global capital into the nation's housing markets. Specifically, Ginnie Mae provides significant liquidity, allowing lenders to obtain a better price for their mortgage loans in the secondary mortgage market. The lenders can then use the proceeds to fund new mortgage loans.
As it did last year, the Administration is seeking $62.3 million to support HUD's fair housing mission.
ELIMINATING/REDUCING INEFFECTIVE PROGRAMS
The Administration continues to seek the elimination of the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program, shifting the activities the block grant program supports to the State and local level. Since 1980, and most recently in 2013, HUD studies found that CDBG is not well targeted to the poorest communities and has not demonstrated a measurable impact on communities. Similarly, the Administration proposes through the Budget the elimination of HUD's Choice Neighborhoods Initiative, HOME Investment Partnerships Program, and the Self-Help Homeownership Opportunity Program (SHOP), because State and local governments can better meet their communities' needs."
03/14/2019:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2019/pr19-028.cfm,HUD and Census Bureau Report New Residential Sales in January 2019,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Census Bureau jointly announced the following new residential sales statistics for January 2019:

New Home Sales
Sales of new single-family houses in January 2019 were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 607,000. This is 6.9 percent (±16.3 percent)* below the revised December rate of 652,000 and is 4.1 percent (±14.0 percent)* below the January 2018 estimate of 633,000.
Sales Price
The median sales price of new houses sold in January 2019 was $317,200. The average sales price was $373,100.
For Sale Inventory and Months' Supply

EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take three months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, six months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2 percent) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percentage change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percentage changes are 90 percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percentage changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised 3 percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at the Census Bureau's website (www.census.gov/construction/nrs/how_the_data_are_collected/index.html).
* The 90 percent confidence interval includes zero. In such cases, there is insufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero."
03/14/2019:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2019/pr19-029.cfm,HUD Issues Second Invitation for Public Housing Agencies to Join Moving to Work Demonstration Program,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is inviting a second round of public housing agencies to join the Department's expanding Moving to Work (MTW) demonstration program. Today's invitation follows a similar notice last October seeking the first cohort under the MTW expansion. MTW allows public housing agencies (PHAs) to practice greater program flexibility and encourages housing choice and self-sufficiency among low-income families. Read HUD's notice to PHAs.
""A growing number of public housing authorities want to develop their own homegrown approaches toward supporting the self-sufficiency of their residents,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""The expanding Moving to Work demonstration program will allow a greater number of local agencies to create local solutions to their unique needs.""
Currently, there are 39 MTW PHAs throughout the nation. In 2015, Congress allowed HUD to expand the MTW demonstration program to 100 additional PHAs over a seven-year period. Like a similar invitation for the first cohort of PHAs in October 2018, HUD will choose a second cohort of MTW agencies through a two-step selection process.
HUD's MTW demonstration program encourages PHAs to develop unique self-sufficiency strategies, tailored to the needs of their local communities. These locally designed strategies will improve upon the one-size-fits-all approach. In contrast to traditional PHAs, MTW agencies have flexibility to design and implement the Housing Choice Vouchers (HCVs) and public housing programs to better benefit the communities they serve. MTW PHAs can also streamline administrative procedures and enjoy greater financial flexibilities to run a more efficient and cost-effective operation.
One hundred MTW PHAs will be added in four cohorts. Each cohort will experiment with a certain affordable housing policy, and HUD will study that policy change to learn what successful MTW innovations should be applied to all PHAs across the nation.
HUD extended the deadline for PHAs to submit letters of interest for cohort one to May 13, 2019. This initial cohort will consist of high-performing PHAs that administer 1,000 or fewer HCVs and public housing units combined, as well as experiment with the MTW flexibilities. The second cohort will consist of PHAs with 1,001 or more public housing and HCV units. Further, in order to ensure adequate sample size, the PHA must have 1,000 or more existing non-elderly, non-disabled public housing and/or HCV households. The second cohort will study different rent reform models that may or may not be income based, to include tiered rents, and/or stepped-up rents. Read HUD's notice extending the deadline for cohort one.
Interested agencies should consider the types of policies they would like to implement as part of the demonstration program. Examples of policies that have been implemented by agencies can be found in the MTW Plans and Reports on HUD's website."

(Earth Services) of Benton, Illinois (http://earthservices.us/) to raze 278 housing units in the Elmwood and McBride public housing complexes in Cairo.
Built in the 1940s, the Elmwood and McBride public housing developments are two-story structures that experienced years of deferred maintenance which ultimately rendered them unsafe and unhealthy for residents.
""The electrical and plumbing systems are out of date, insulation is insufficient and the cost of repairing these developments to meet basic health and safety standards exceeds $7.5 million,"" explained Jereon Brown, a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development spokesman. ""In the end, the only responsible solution for these World War II-era buildings was to tear them down.""
HUD provided the 185 Elmwood and McBride families with tenant protection vouchers that allowed them to relocate anywhere within the nation.
Earth Services provides demolition services locally and nationwide. Generally, the firm will perform a pre-demolition assessment of each building, remove remaining hazardous materials such as asbestos and perform lead-based paint (LBP) mitigation, as needed. Following demolition, the company will remove all debris and material to appropriate disposal facilities.

03/28/2019:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2019/pr19-035.cfm,HUD Charges Facebook with Housing Discrimination Over Company's Targeted Advertising Practices,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is charging Facebook with violating the Fair Housing Act by encouraging, enabling, and causing housing discrimination through the company's advertising platform. Read HUD's Charge against Facebook.
Today's action follows HUD's investigation of a Secretary-initiated complaint filed on August 13, 2018. HUD alleges that Facebook unlawfully discriminates based on race, color, national origin, religion, familial status, sex, and disability by restricting who can view housing-related ads on Facebook's platforms and across the internet. Further, HUD claims Facebook mines extensive data about its users and then uses those data to determine which of its users view housing-related ads based, in part, on these protected characteristics.
""Facebook is discriminating against people based upon who they are and where they live,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""Using a computer to limit a person's housing choices can be just as discriminatory as slamming a door in someone's face.""
HUD General Counsel Paul Compton added, ""Even as we confront new technologies, the fair housing laws enacted over half a century ago remain clear—discrimination in housing-related advertising is against the law. Just because a process to deliver advertising is opaque and complex doesn't mean that it exempts Facebook and others from our scrutiny and the law of the land. Fashioning appropriate remedies and the rules of the road for today's technology as it impacts housing are a priority for HUD.""
The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in housing and in housing-related services, including online advertisements, based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, disability, or familial status.
According to HUD's Charge, Facebook enabled advertisers to exclude people whom Facebook classified as parents; non-American-born; non-Christian; interested in accessibility; interested in Hispanic culture; or a wide variety of other interests that closely align with the Fair Housing Act's protected classes. HUD is also charging that Facebook enabled advertisers to exclude people based upon their neighborhood by drawing a red line around those neighborhoods on a map. Facebook also allegedly gave advertisers the option of showing ads only to men or only to women.
The Charge further asserts that Facebook also uses the protected characteristics of people to determine who will view ads regardless of whether an advertiser wants to reach a broad or narrow audience. HUD claims Facebook combines data it collects about user attributes and behavior with data it obtains about user behavior on other websites and in the non-digital world. Facebook then allegedly uses machine learning and other prediction techniques to classify and group users to project each user's likely response to a given ad, and in doing so, may recreate groupings defined by their protected class. The Charge concludes that by grouping users who have similar attributes and behaviors (unrelated to housing) and presuming a shared interest or disinterest in housing-related advertisements, Facebook's mechanisms function just like an advertiser who intentionally targets or excludes users based on their protected class.
Through its Charge, HUD seeks to address unresolved fair housing issues regarding Facebook's advertising practices and to obtain appropriate relief for the harm Facebook caused and continues to cause.
In August 2018, the Department of Justice, joined by HUD, filed a statement of interest in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) on behalf of a number of private litigants challenging Facebook's advertising platform. Read SDNY's statement of interest (www.justice.gov/crt/case-document/file/1089231/download).
HUD's Charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the Charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages for harm caused by the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose fines to vindicate the public interest. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages.

Read the agreement.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to discriminate in the sale or rental of housing on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, disability, or familial status. This includes refusing to rent to a family because they have children.
""Families shouldn't have their access to housing denied simply because they have children,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""This type of discrimination has been against the law for more than 30 years and HUD will continue working to make the public and housing providers aware of their rights and responsibilities under the Fair Housing Act.""
The case came to HUD's attention when Project Sentinel, a HUD Fair Housing Initiatives Program agency, filed a complaint on behalf of the couple, alleging that the family was denied the opportunity to rent a two-bedroom unit managed by Tri-Tal Realty because they have children. The housing providers deny that they discriminated against the couple.
Under the terms of the agreement, the owners and manager will pay $10,000 to the couple and $5,000 to Project Sentinel. In addition, the agreement requires that Tri-Tal Realty revise its policies and that its employees attend annual fair housing training for the next three years.

04/01/2019:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2019/pr19-039.cfm,HUD Continues to Find Widespread Violations of Disability Access Laws in City of Los Angeles' Affordable Housing,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today issued a letter to the City of Los Angeles, detailing the city's ongoing failure to provide accessible housing for low-income persons with disabilities.
HUD's Supplemental Letter of Findings expands on observations the Department first made in 2012 when it notified the City of its noncompliance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504) and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Since that time, the City has knowingly failed to comply with federal accessibility requirements and is compounding inaccessibility in its affordable housing program.
Los Angeles receives substantial financial assistance from HUD to support community development and affordable housing. Since 2005, HUD allocated more than $1.5 billion to support Los Angeles' community development and affordable housing needs, including to build and rehabilitate affordable, accessible housing for families with low-to-moderate incomes. Federal accessibility laws require that the City provide people with disabilities an equal opportunity to benefit from its affordable housing. Despite this, the City continues to exclude persons with disabilities from hundreds of its affordable housing developments by permitting discriminatory practices, funding construction that does not comply with federal standards for accessible design and failing to correct noncompliant properties. At all 120 housing developments surveyed from the City's affordable housing portfolio as part of this review, HUD found significant accessibility violations.
HUD Secretary Ben Carson said, ""It is unacceptable that Los Angeles continues to knowingly limit affordable housing opportunities for people with disabilities. Sadly, the City continues to engage in a widespread practice of flouting federal laws that require taxpayer dollars be used to produce affordable housing that persons with disabilities can live in.""
HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, Anna Maria Farías, explained, ""For years, Los Angeles has produced taxpayer-supported affordable housing that effectively excludes persons living with disabilities. The City's widespread and years-long noncompliance with its legal requirements has likely denied housing to thousands of families who desperately needed these homes.""
HUD's General Counsel, J. Paul Compton, Jr., noted that ""HUD has been patiently negotiating with the City in good faith to bring it into compliance with federal law, but the City has shown no genuine interest in doing what is necessary to develop affordable housing in an accessible manner. HUD will continue to take action through the many available means to ensure that the City takes its legal obligations seriously.""
Section 504 prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance. Title II of the ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in all programs, services, and activities of public entities.

April is Fair Housing Month, a time when we celebrate the Fair Housing Act and recommit ourselves to ensuring every American has access to housing that is free from discrimination. The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to discriminate in housing transactions based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, disability, or family status. This year, HUD is especially focused on protecting the right of individuals to feel safe and secure in their homes, free from sexual harassment or unwanted sexual advances.
""Complaints we receive and cases we see tell us that there are some housing providers who unfortunately prey on vulnerable men and women,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""No one should have to tolerate harassment or unwanted sexual advances in order to keep a roof over their head, and HUD will continue to take appropriate action when discrimination of this type occurs.""
HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity (FHEO) will introduce the ""Call HUD"" campaign during the Department's Fair Housing Month opening program, which will take place at HUD headquarters, 451 7th Street, SW, Washington, DC, from 2 p.m. to 3 p.m., Thursday, April 4, inside the Brooke-Mondale Auditorium. During the program, two survivors of sexual harassment will share their stories about how they called HUD and got help. In addition, the program will highlight ABC Nightline's recent story: Uncovering Rampant Sexual Harassment in Housing System (https://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/video/uncovering-rampant-sexual-harassment-housing-systems-61319608)s, which features women who share their stories of abuse and the impact the experience had on their lives, as well as how HUD and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) helped them to obtain the justice they deserved, and in one case, a $2.7 million settlement.
In April 2018, HUD and DOJ launched a nationwide joint initiative that combats sexual harassment in housing by increasing the public's awareness of the issue and encouraging the reporting of harassment.
This year, throughout the month of April, the ""Humans of HUD"" photoblog will feature victims of sexual harassment in housing, highlighting the personal testimonies of survivors and those who helped them.
HUD will end the month with a closing ceremony on April 29 that will include a Fireside Chat between HUD and DOJ representatives involved with the initiative. The event will also include the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding, which establishes, among other things, sexual harassment training sessions for housing providers.
Every year, HUD and its fair housing partner organizations pursue enforcement actions, work to enhance the public's awareness of their housing rights, and emphasize the importance of ending housing discrimination. Last year alone, HUD and its partner agencies received almost 8,000 complaints alleging discrimination based on one or more of the Fair Housing Act's seven protected classes: race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, and disability.
Persons who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY)."
04/03/2019:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2019/pr19-041.cfm,HUD Issues Proposed Rule to Make Section 3 More Efficient and Effective,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today published a proposed rule to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of Section 3 within the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968. Section 3 requires that employment, training, contracting, and other economic opportunities generated by certain HUD financial assistance be directed to the greatest extent feasible to low- and very low-income persons, especially recipients of government assistance for housing, and to businesses that provide economic opportunities to low- and very low-income persons. See the proposed rule here.
HUD's outdated Section 3 regulations have not been updated since 1994 and are not as effective as they could be at creating employment opportunities for low- and very low-income persons and businesses. The changes in the proposed rule are intended to improve the effectiveness of Section 3, streamline some processes that do not yield significant benefits, and encourage public housing authorities (PHAs) and HUD grantees to focus on career ladders for low-income people, all with the aim of increasing the long-term earnings of HUD-assisted households.
""HUD funding is more than an investment in affordable housing or community development, it's an investment in people,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""The rule we are proposing today will allow more HUD-assisted households to secure long-term employment and put them on a path towards self-sufficiency.""
The changes in the proposed rule seek to improve effectiveness by:
Focusing on key outcome metrics, such as the sustained employment of targeted populations; Crediting retention of low-income employees and successful sustained employment in the reporting metrics; Aligning Section 3 reporting with standard business practices and payroll tracking; Allowing for tailored outcome benchmarks for different geographies and/or different activities; Reducing reporting requirements for grantees who are meeting outcome benchmarks; and Integrating Section 3 into the program offices who are in regular contact with the grantees.
• Focusing on key outcome metrics, such as the sustained employment of targeted populations;
• Crediting retention of low-income employees and successful sustained employment in the reporting metrics;
• Aligning Section 3 reporting with standard business practices and payroll tracking;
• Allowing for tailored outcome benchmarks for different geographies and/or different activities;
• Reducing reporting requirements for grantees who are meeting outcome benchmarks; and
• Integrating Section 3 into the program offices who are in regular contact with the grantees.
The proposed rule is a result of a Secretarial established taskforce and feedback received from listening sessions held with small and large PHAs, grantees, multifamily property owners and other entities involved with Section 3. Interested members of the public are encouraged to submit comment on the HUD proposed rule by June 2, 2019. Comments can be submitted at www.regulations.gov."

04/05/2019:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2019/pr19-044.cfm,HUD Reaches Agreement with California Housing Providers Settling Claims of Housing Discrimination,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has approved a Conciliation/Voluntary Compliance Agreement between the owners of a Sunnyvale, California, apartment complex and a single mother of two who is a domestic violence survivor.
The agreement settles claims alleging that Essex Property Trust, Inc., and Essex Portfolio, L.P., discriminated against the woman based on her sex when they refused to remove her then-husband from her lease after she obtained a restraining order against him. Read the agreement.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing discrimination based on sex.
""Survivors of abuse shouldn't be victimized by having their housing rights violated,"" said Anna María Farías HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD is committed to ensuring that housing providers are aware of their responsibilities under the Fair Housing Act and that they take steps to comply with those obligations.""
The case came to HUD's attention when a single mother filed a complaint alleging that the manager of her apartment building discriminated against her because of her sex when she refused to remove the woman's then-husband from the lease and change her locks, even after she had obtained a restraining order against him.
The woman alleged that the property manager ultimately agreed to change the locks but told the woman that her then-husband could still have a copy of the new key upon request. The woman alleged that she moved out of her apartment due to concern for her safety. The owners deny that they discriminated against the woman but agreed to resolve the complaint.
Under the terms of the agreement, Essex Property Trust, Inc., will pay the woman $20,000. In addition, Essex Property Trust and Essex Portfolio will implement a domestic violence policy at its more than 240 residential properties that addresses the safety and housing needs of tenants who experience domestic violence, and distribute the policy to its employees and agents. The agreement also requires that the owners' regional manager and on-site property manager participate in fair housing training.

Read the Order.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from denying or limiting housing to families with children under age 18, including refusing to negotiate, making discriminatory statements, and publishing discriminatory advertisements based on familial status.
""It's hard enough for families to find places to live that meet their needs without being denied suitable housing because they have children,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD is committed to working to ensure that housing providers comply with their Fair Housing Act obligation to treat all applicants the same, including families with children.""
Paul Compton, HUD's General Counsel, commented: ""This settlement represents an important step in HUD's continued efforts to ensure that all persons, including families with children, are able to pursue housing opportunities free from discrimination.""
The case came to HUD's attention when Pine Tree Legal Assistance, Inc., a HUD Fair Housing Initiatives Program agency in Portland, Maine, filed a complaint alleging that Page Realty, LLC, and Ramona Venskus discriminated based on familial status when they refused to negotiate with fair housing testers posing as families with children, posted discriminatory advertisements indicating that children were not allowed, and made discriminatory statements to fair housing testers. The Order resolves HUD's October 2018 charge of discrimination against the owner and real estate agent.
Under the Consent Order, Page Realty, LLC, and Ramona Venskus will pay Pine Tree Legal Assistance, Inc., $18,000 and attend fair housing training.

According to HUD's complaint, Korey Sloan and Christie Caldwell are married and own a single-family property in Matteson, Illinois. In 2006, Caldwell and the couple's four children sought rental assistance from the Housing Authority of Cook County (HACC) to lease the home from Sloan, who posed as an unrelated landlord.
In her initial application for rental assistance, and in subsequent tenant recertifications, Caldwell denied any relationship with Sloan and any ownership interest in the property while the family continued to reside in the home. As a result, Sloan and Caldwell fraudulently obtained rent subsidies they were not qualified to receive for more than seven years.
Following its investigation, HUD's Office of Inspector General referred the matter to the Illinois Attorney General's Office for criminal prosecution and to HUD for an action under the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act (PFCRA). An Administrative Law Judge for the Department ruled that, by failing to respond to the complaint, the couple admitted to defrauding the Housing Choice Voucher Program and is therefore liable for penalties totaling $25,830."

""Through this request, we are looking to better understand how HUD can better tailor its policies and help Opportunity Zones create more positive economic outcomes for the millions of Americans that live in these areas, and for our country as a whole.""
In this RFI, HUD is seeking information on the following:
How HUD should use its existing authorities to maximize the beneficial impact of public and private investments in urban and economically distressed communities; Whether HUD should create an information portal, and what information it should include; How HUD should prioritize support for urban and economically distressed areas, including Opportunity Zones, in its grants, financing, and other assistance; What types of technical assistance should be offered through HUD; How HUD can ensure existing residents, businesses, and community organizations in Opportunity Zones benefit from the influx of investment; How HUD can properly evaluate the impact of Opportunity Zones on communities; How HUD should interact with other stakeholders to maximize the success of the Opportunity Zone incentive; How Qualified Opportunity Fund investments might support the goal of ending homelessness; and Any other aspects of Opportunity Zones that should be considered and are not addressed in this request for information.

The Council's 13 Federal member agencies are engaging with governments at all levels—State, local, tribal, and Territorial—on ways to more effectively use taxpayer dollars to revitalize low-income communities.
President Trump signed the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, creating Opportunity Zones to stimulate long-term investments in low-income communities. The program offers capital gains tax relief to those who invest in these distressed areas. This program is anticipated to spur $100 billion in private capital investment in Opportunity Zones. Incentivizing investment in low-income communities fosters economic revitalization, job creation, and promotes sustainable economic growth across the nation, especially in communities HUD serves. Read more about the Opportunity Zones program (www.irs.gov/newsroom/tax-reform-creates-opportunity-zone-tax-incentive).
Opportunity Zones are a powerful vehicle for bringing economic growth and job creation to the American communities that need it the most. On average, the median family income in an Opportunity Zone is 37 percent below the state median. Overall, more than 8,700 communities in all 50 States, Washington D.C., and five U.S. Territories have been designated as Opportunity Zones. Nearly 35 million Americans live in communities designated as Opportunity Zones.

04/18/2019:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2019/pr19-051.cfm,HUD Tells Public Housing Authorities and Private Owners to Protect Residents from Carbon Monoxide,"WASHINGTON - In an effort to protect families living in federally subsidized housing from potentially deadly carbon monoxide (CO), the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today sent all public housing authorities and private owners of HUD-subsidized housing a notice to remind and encourage them to install working CO detectors in their properties. Read HUD's notice.
HUD's notice reminds HUD-subsidized housing providers of their legal obligation to install working carbon monoxide detectors in those jurisdictions where these devices are required. In those states and local communities where CO detectors are not required, the Department is strongly encouraging housing authorities and owners to install them. Additionally, HUD indicated that it will propose new regulations to require working CO detectors in all HUD-subsidized housing programs nationwide.
""A simple, inexpensive, widely available device can be the difference between life and death,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""Given the unevenness of state and local law, we intend to make certain that CO detectors are required in all our housing programs, just as we require smoke detectors, no matter where our HUD-assisted families live.""
Carbon monoxide is a byproduct of fuel-fired combustion appliances such as furnaces and water heaters. If not properly vented, this undetectable gas can be dangerous and even deadly. Last month, HUD's Real Estate Assessment Center (REAC) issued a notice to all HUD and HUD-contracted inspectors requiring them to collect data to determine the prevalence of CO detection systems in HUD-assisted properties subject to its Uniform Physical Condition Standards.
HUD's notice issued today covers the following programs:
Public Housing Section 8 Project-Based Rental Assistance Housing Choice Voucher (tenant-based or project-based), Section 202 (Supportive Housing for the Elderly), and Section 811 (Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities).
• Public Housing
• Section 8 Project-Based Rental Assistance
• Housing Choice Voucher (tenant-based or project-based),
• Section 202 (Supportive Housing for the Elderly), and
• Section 811 (Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities).
In those states where CO detectors are required, HUD is reminding owners, managers and agents of these housing programs to make certain they have working CO detectors in all their housing units/buildings. In those states where CO detectors are not required under state/local law, HUD is strongly encouraging these housing providers to install them.
HUD anticipates issuing further guidance and instructions on this important public health issue. In addition, HUD will undertake rulemaking for the Housing Choice Voucher, Multifamily and Public Housing Programs to add a requirement for functioning carbon monoxide detectors in units with fuel-fired/burning appliance(s), and/or an attached garage."

The University of Maryland team was one of four finalists to design a new mixed-use development for low- and moderate-income residents situated along the San Antonio Riverwalk. HUD also announced a team from the University of California Berkley as runner-up.
""When it comes to creating innovative affordable housing, HUD does not do this work alone,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""Congratulations to the University of Maryland and all of our finalists, for their consciousness stream of good ideas that increases housing opportunity for Americans with modest incomes.""
HUD's Innovation in Affordable Housing competition strives to spur research, collaboration, and creativity in affordable housing and community development. This year's challenge required competitors to design living and retail spaces that reinforce essential services, ensuring that residents connected to the surrounding community and near employment opportunities.
The students presented their final projects to a jury of practitioners and a live audience at HUD's headquarters in Washington, DC. The University of Maryland team will receive a $20,000 award and the team from the University of California at Berkeley will receive a $10,000 award.
The competition jurors praised the winning team for their financial package as well as their real understanding of the concepts being proposed. The team was also commended for proposing the highest density, which makes the math more logical and, of course, provides more housing opportunity to more people.
The University of California, Berkeley team was judged runner-up for its financing also, as well as elements of the site design. The other finalists comprised students from Yale University and Virginia Tech.
By initiating and funding this competition, HUD hopes to inspire and support aspiring members of fields such as architecture, planning, policy, and finance in advancing affordable and sustainable housing for low- and moderate-income Americans."

EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take three months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, six months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2 percent) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percentage change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percentage changes are 90 percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percentage changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised 3 percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at the Census Bureau's website (www.census.gov/construction/nrs/how_the_data_are_collected/index.html).
* The 90 percent confidence interval includes zero. In such cases, there is insufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero."
04/23/2019:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2019/pr19-055.cfm,HUD Announces Agreement Resolving Discrimination Allegations Involving California Property Management Company,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced a fair housing agreement between a San Diego-area property management company and a family with a child who has a respiratory disability. The agreement resolves allegations that Property West Residential, Inc., which manages Meadow Woods at Alpine Apartment complex in Alpine, California, refused to grant the mother's request to be moved to a unit away from her neighbors who were heavy smokers. Read the agreement.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from denying or limiting housing because of a person's disability and from refusing to make reasonable accommodations in policies or practices.
""Allowing a parent to move to a different unit in order to protect the health of their child is not special treatment, it is complying with the law,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will continue working with housing providers to help them meet their reasonable accommodation obligations under the Fair Housing Act
The case came to HUD's attention when a single mother of a child with respiratory disabilities filed a complaint alleging that the property manager denied her requests to move to another unit because the smoke from her neighbor's unit exacerbated her son's disability. The owners of Property West Residential, Inc., deny that they discriminated against the woman.
Under the terms of the agreement, Property West Residential, Inc., will pay the mother $5,000 and forgive $5,560.47 that the company alleges she owed. In addition, each of Meadow Woods at Alpine's property managers will attend fair housing training.
Persons who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY)."

05/09/2019:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2019/pr19-058.cfm,FHA Offers Incentives for Property Owners Who Invest in Opportunity Zones,"WASHINGTON - The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) today announced a package of incentives to encourage multi-family property owners to invest in thousands of neighborhoods located in Opportunity Zones across the nation. Read today's Housing Notice.
FHA is introducing reduced application fees paid by property owners applying for certain multifamily mortgage insurance programs for the development or rehabilitation of apartment units located, or proposed to be located, in Opportunity Zones. In addition, FHA is designating teams of senior underwriters to review these applications to ensure the most attentive and timely processing.
When more investors can apply for benefits in Opportunity Zones, more investors can supply benefits in Opportunity Zones. And that's exactly the intention of today's Notice,"" said Secretary Carson. ""These FHA incentives, combined with the preference points HUD already offers grantees for activities in Opportunity Zones, show how this Administration is maximizing the power of public-private partnerships to never forget - and always lift up - our nation's ""the forgotten men and women.""
Reduced Application Fees
Applicants to FHA's New Construction and Substantial Rehabilitation (Section 221(d)(4)), Urban Renewal and Concentrated Development (Section 220), and Purchase or Refinance of Existing Multifamily Property (Section 223(f)) multifamily mortgage insurance programs will be eligible for significantly lower application fees provided the property is located within qualified Opportunity Zones. For transactions that are defined as 'broadly affordable,' FHA's application fee will be reduced from the current $3 per thousand dollars of the requested mortgage amount to $1 per thousand dollars of the requested mortgage amount, resulting in an average cost saving to applicants of approximately $28,000. 'Broadly affordable' is defined as developments in which at least 90 percent of the units are Section 8-eligible or deemed affordable under the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program.
""When more investors can apply for benefits in Opportunity Zones, more investors can supply benefits in Opportunity Zones. And that's exactly the intention of today's Notice,"" said Secretary Ben Carson. ""These FHA incentives, combined with the preference points HUD already offers grantees for activities in Opportunity Zones, show how this Administration is maximizing the power of public-private partnerships to never forget - and always lift up - our nation's 'forgotten men and women.'""
For 'market rate' and 'affordable' transactions, FHA will reduce application fees from $3 to $2 per thousand dollars of the requested mortgage amount, resulting in an estimated average cost savings of $14,000. Read more about the definitions of broadly affordable and affordable in the Federal Register (www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2016-03-31/pdf/2016-07405.pdf).
Designated Senior Underwriters
FHA will designate seasoned underwriters to process applications located in Opportunity Zones to ensure expert and expedient reviews. Applications must meet the following criteria to qualify for reduced fees and designated underwriting:
The application is submitted under FHA's Section 221(d)(4), Section 220, or Section 223(f) program for a property located in, or proposed to be located in, a qualified Opportunity Zone, and/or: The application involves an investment from a Qualified Opportunity Fund (QOF).
• The application is submitted under FHA's Section 221(d)(4), Section 220, or Section 223(f) program for a property located in, or proposed to be located in, a qualified Opportunity Zone, and/or:
• The application involves an investment from a Qualified Opportunity Fund (QOF).
The new incentives offered by FHA are available immediately for applicants of market-rate properties that have not yet submitted a pre-application, and for applicants for affordable properties that have not yet applied. Opportunity Zones Created under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Opportunity Zones are intended to stimulate economic development and job creation in distressed low-income communities by incentivizing long-term capital investment. The program offers capital gains tax relief to those who invest in these targeted distressed areas. This program is anticipated to spur approximately $100 billion of private capital investment in Opportunity Zones. There are more than 8,700 census tracts designated as Opportunity Zones in all 50 States and in the U.S. territories.

05/09/2019:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2019/pr19-059.cfm,FHA Proposes New Lender Certification Requirements,"WASHINGTON - The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) today proposed several revisions to its lender certification requirements with the goal of providing lenders and servicers greater certainty in how to satisfy the agency's compliance requirements. In providing greater certainty to the process, FHA believes the changes will facilitate more competition in the market and result in more financing choices for borrowers, especially first-time and minority homebuyers.
FHA is proposing significant changes to its loan-level and annual lender-level certifications to provide more precision and needed clarity to compliance documents. Specifically, FHA is proposing revisions to its Addendum to Uniform Residential Loan Application (Form 92900-A) and to its annual lender certification form. In addition, FHA is revising its 'defect taxonomy' to clarify the various loan defect categories and how the agency weighs the severity of each defect. Visit FHA's 'drafting table' to read more.
""A key focus of this Administration and of my tenure at HUD has been to improve the clarity, certainty, and transparency of our regulations and requirements,"" said Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson. ""As part of this work, we have updated our defect taxonomy as well as the annual and loan-level certifications delivered in connection with FHA-insured loans. While HUD will preserve its strict enforcement authority where our requirements are violated, we will continue to reduce unnecessary burdens on stakeholders across our programs.""
""It has become clear that our lending partners are seeking clarity and greater certainty when documenting compliance with FHA requirements,"" said Acting Deputy Secretary and FHA Commissioner Brian Montgomery. ""We are proposing a new, more transparent set of requirements that will preserve our enforcement authority. We anticipate that this will encourage more lender participation in FHA business, thus increasing competition in the market and resulting in greater choices for borrowers.""
Since the housing crisis, the number of traditional banks participating in FHA's single-family mortgage insurance programs has declined, resulting in a growing share of non-bank lenders originating FHA-insured mortgages. In order to expand mortgage financing options offered by a more diverse population of lending institutions, President Trump issued a memorandum on Federal Housing Finance Reform on March 27, 2019. The President's memorandum included a directive that FHA work to diversify the network of FHA-approved lenders through ""increased participation by registered depository institutions.""
In its Fiscal Year 2018 annual report to Congress on the fiscal health of its Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMIF), FHA indicated its intent to clarify the perceived severity of defects and certain types of noncompliance. Combined, the proposed changes announced today will provide lenders additional certainty and clarity on FHA's requirements, and help FHA quickly recognize when lenders are failing to meet those requirements."
05/13/2019:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2019/pr19-060.cfm,HUD Awards $85 Million to Revitalize Three Low-Income Neighborhoods,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson today announced three communities across the country will receive a combined $85 million to redevelop severely distressed public or assisted housing and to revitalize surrounding neighborhoods. Provided through HUD's Choice Neighborhoods Initiative, these grants, and the more than $620 million they will stimulate from other sources, will transform long-struggling neighborhoods and distressed HUD-assisted housing.
Secretary Carson announced that the following communities are selected to receive Choice Neighborhoods grants to implement their neighborhood transformation plans:
Read more about these communities' transformation plans.
""HUD's work is about more than just housing those in need, we also have a responsibility to help create thriving communities where residents can grow and flourish,"" said Secretary Carson. ""The grants we are announcing today will leverage additional funds to revitalize entire neighborhoods and create more opportunities for those who live there.""
HUD's Choice Neighborhoods Initiative leverages significant public and private dollars to support locally driven strategies that address struggling neighborhoods with distressed public or HUD-assisted housing through a comprehensive approach to neighborhood transformation. Local leaders, residents, and stakeholders, such as public housing authorities, cities, schools, police, business owners, nonprofits, and private developers, come together to create and implement a plan that revitalizes distressed HUD housing and addresses the challenges in the surrounding neighborhood. The program helps communities transform neighborhoods by revitalizing severely distressed public and/or assisted housing and catalyzing critical improvements in the neighborhood, including vacant property, housing, businesses, services and schools.
The Choice Neighborhoods program focuses on three core goals:
1. Housing: Replace distressed public and assisted housing with high-quality mixed-income housing that is well-managed and responsive to the needs of the surrounding neighborhood;
2. People: Improve outcomes of households living in the target housing related to employment and income, health, and children's education; and
3. Neighborhood: Create the conditions necessary for public and private reinvestment in distressed neighborhoods to offer the kinds of amenities and assets, including safety, good schools, and commercial activity, that are important to families' choices about their community.
Together, the selected awardees are proposing to replace 988 distressed public housing units with 1,730 new mixed-income, mixed-use housing units as part of an overall effort to revitalize neighborhoods. For every $1 in Choice Neighborhoods funding they receive, the awardees and their partners will leverage an additional $7.30 in public and private funding for their project proposals. Together, these three communities are leveraging an initial $620.5 million through other public/private sources to magnify their impact. In addition to the funds being awarded today, HUD will award an additional $30 million later in the year to Baton Rouge if mutually agreed upon changes are made.
The Choice Neighborhoods Program builds on the successes of HUD's HOPE VI Program, linking housing improvements with a wide variety of public services and neighborhood improvements to create neighborhoods of opportunity. Choice Neighborhoods is HUD's signature place-based program, which supports innovative and inclusive strategies that bring public and private partners together to help break the cycle of intergenerational poverty."

EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take three months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, six months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2 percent) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percentage change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percentage changes are 90 percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percentage changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised 3 percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at the Census Bureau's website (www.census.gov/construction/nrc/how_the_data_are_collected/index.html).
* The 90 percent confidence interval includes zero. In such cases, there is insufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero."

The Dashboard details the size of each grant received over the past several years, as well as the total amount of funds currently available to be spent on affordable housing and community and economic development activities. Before modernizing the Grants Dashboard, HUD relied on manual reports that could not efficiently drive critical decisions or provide oversight into all grant programs.
""It is a great honor to receive MicroStrategy's 2019 Federal IT Innovation Award. We have made it a priority to modernize our systems to improve the way HUD does business,"" said Secretary Ben Carson.

Provided through HUD's Emergency Safety and Security Program, these funds represent the first time HUD is targeting grants specifically for the purchase and installation of carbon monoxide detectors.
The funding availability comes a month after HUD announced its intention to make optional CO detectors mandatory and sent a notice to all public housing authorities and private owners of HUD-subsidized housing reminding and encouraging them to install working CO detectors in their properties. HUD has been working with Congressional leaders on the Senate Banking Committee on legislation that will require CO detectors in HUD-assisted housing units that need them. Read more about HUD's efforts to protect residents from carbon monoxide.
""Carbon monoxide poisoning presents a risk to families living in public housing,"" said Secretary Carson. ""This funding will allow more public housing authorities to purchase and install these lifesaving detectors.""
Carbon monoxide is a byproduct of fuel-fired combustion appliances, such as furnaces and water heaters. If not properly vented, this undetectable gas can be dangerous and even deadly. In March, HUD's Real Estate Assessment Center (REAC) issued a notice to all HUD and HUD-contracted inspectors requiring them to collect data to determine the prevalence of CO detection systems in HUD-assisted properties subject to its Uniform Physical Condition Standards.

05/22/2019:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2019/pr19-076.cfm,HUD Charges Alabama Landlords with Discriminating Against Resident with Disabilities,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is charging a property owner and manager in Mobile, Alabama with violating the Fair Housing Act. HUD claims the owner and manager of Hunter's Pointe Apartments engaged in discrimination by refusing to accommodate the special needs of a resident with disabilities. Read the charge.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from discriminating because of disability. This includes denying or limiting housing to persons with disabilities and refusing to make reasonable accommodations in policies or practices when a person with a disability needs them.
""For more than 30 years, the law clearly states that persons with disabilities have had the right to reasonable accommodations, yet too many continue to have this right denied,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Today's action reaffirms HUD's ongoing commitment to ensuring that housing providers meet their obligations under the law.""
The case came to HUD's attention when a tenant with a mobility disability filed a complaint alleging that the owners and property manager of Hunter's Pointe denied his multiple requests to move to a first-floor unit, even though he presented medical documentation attesting to his need for the accommodation.
Specifically, HUD's charge alleges that the owner of the property, Hunter's Pointe, L.L.C., of Birmingham, violated the Act by refusing to allow the tenant to move from his second-floor apartment to a first-floor unit. HUD's charge further alleges that during the same period, management rented first-floor units to residents without disabilities. Consequently, the tenant was forced to move to another apartment complex.
""When a resident is entitled to a reasonable accommodation under the Fair Housing Act, a housing provider is obligated to provide it,"" said HUD Acting Deputy General Counsel for Enforcement Timothy Petty. ""HUD remains committed to holding housing providers accountable for any failure to comply with the law.""
The charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party elects for the case to be heard in federal court. If the administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he or she may award damages to the complainant for his loss as a result of the discrimination. The judge may also order other injunctive or equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties to vindicate the public interest.
Persons who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY)."

Read the Voluntary Compliance/Conciliation Agreement.
The agreement resolves allegations that the El Trebol public housing development was inaccessible to persons with disabilities for more than a year because of inoperable elevators. Other allegations involved PRPHA refusing to accommodate residents with mobility impairments by actions such as moving them to first floor units, and a claim that at least one elderly resident suffered an injury while climbing a set of stairs due to the lack of elevator service.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from denying or limiting housing because of a person's disability and from refusing to make reasonable accommodations in policies or practices.
""Housing authorities have an obligation to maintain their properties in a way that meets the needs of its residents, including those with disabilities,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Today's settlement sends a clear message that HUD is committed to ensuring that housing providers comply with the requirements of the Fair Housing Act.""
The case came to HUD's attention when four residents with disabilities filed individual complaints alleging that PRPHA had refused to, among other things, install accessible toilets and fix inoperable elevators.
Under the terms of the agreement, PRPHA will spend $884,640 to repair existing inoperable elevators and install six new elevators, and pay $23,760 to the four residents who filed the initial complaint. In addition, $32,400 will be paid to 16 other residents with disabilities who were harmed by the prolonged elevator outages. The agreement also calls for the establishment of a new educational technology center at the complex, improvements to the children's playground, and the creation of a $20,000 Victim's Fund to compensate other disabled family members who have not yet been identified.

All ranges given for percentage changes are 90 percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percentage changes shown in the tables.

Read the Voluntary Compliance/Conciliation Agreement.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits sexual harassment of tenants and other forms of harassment and housing discrimination based on race, sex, color, national origin, disability, religion and familial status.
""Being asked to submit to unwelcome sexual advances not only creates a hostile living environment, it's against the law,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Today's settlement demonstrates HUD's commitment to ensuring that landlords and other housing providers recognize their obligations under the Fair Housing Act and take steps to comply with those obligations.""
The case came to HUD's attention when a woman filed a complaint with HUD alleging that her landlord, David Sheets, sexually harassed her while she was living in one of his apartments. Specifically, the woman alleged that on numerous occasions during her tenancy, the landlord requested sex from her in exchange for a reduction in her rent.
Under the terms of the agreement, the landlord, who denied the allegations, will pay $30,000 to the woman and $7,000 to her attorney. The agreement also requires that the landlord contract with a licensed, independent third-party real estate management company to manage all of his residential properties for the next five years.
Last month, HUD launched a special campaign and training initiative designed to inform renters, landlords, property managers, maintenance workers and others that sexual harassment in housing violates the Fair Housing Act.

WASHINGTON - In just its third year, a national campaign to promote literacy and a life-long love of reading has distributed one million books to children living in public housing. The Book-Rich Environments Initiative (BRE) (www.nationalbook.org/programs/book-rich-environments) is a collaboration aimed to transform public housing authorities (PHAs) into book-rich environments by providing diverse, high quality books and other literacy tools to children and families living in HUD-assisted housing
The BRE Initiative seeks to improve literacy outcomes and to ensure all young people, regardless of their background, have the tools they need to reach their full potential. Led by the National Book Foundation, the initiative includes the combined efforts of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the U.S. Department of Education (ED), the Urban Libraries Council, and the National Center for Families Learning.
""Books opened up an entire world for me and I know how powerful they can be for so many kids we serve,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""One million books and counting!""
""We work year-round to make sure that all kinds of readers, all over the country, have the resources and the encouragement to help form meaningful, lasting relationships to literature"" said David Steinberger, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the National Book Foundation. ""We couldn't do this work alone, and it's been amazing to be able to offer our support to the outstanding teams at local libraries and literacy organizations who work tirelessly to serve their communities.""
Thirty-nine HUD-assisted communities in 22 states across the country serve as local partners, implementing the following key components:
Book Distribution - free, high-quality, diverse books provided to children and families living in HUD-assisted housing. Library Engagement - young people and families engaged in the love of reading and connected with the ongoing literacy activities offered by the local public library. Partnership Building - strategic partnerships on the local level, established between the local public housing authority, the local library, and local literacy partners to develop and deliver ongoing community and educational programming.
• Book Distribution - free, high-quality, diverse books provided to children and families living in HUD-assisted housing.

The BRE Initiative is made possible through the generous book donations provided by: Candlewick Press, Hachette Book Group, HarperCollins Publishers, Macmillan Publishers, Penguin Random House, Scholastic, and Simon & Schuster.
Each local public housing authority pledges to hold at least three book-distribution events at which the publisher-donated titles make their way into the hands of children and families. These events are held at public housing buildings and community centers, with local library branches facilitating giveaways, coordinating library card signups, and sharing information on literacy resources available to families. Past events have included building a pop-up library in administrative offices, hosting holiday events that couple festivities with book distributions, and even PHA staff visiting residents door-to-door to pass out books.
With a focus on providing free books, programming, and vital connections to local resources, BRE seeks to make long-lasting impact within PHAs, helping to create sustainable book rich environments where literature is accessible and celebrated within the community.

Read HUD's new funding announcement.
""HUD-approved housing counselors can make all the difference in helping families find and keep stable housing,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""Research demonstrates that housing counseling helps people make informed housing choices and can be the best preventative medicine to avoid housing problems down the road.""
HUD estimates that every federal dollar invested in housing counseling stimulates six dollars from other state and local sources. Working through a network of more than 1,700 approved counseling agencies, it is expected that more than one million households will receive the counseling services they need. Read more about the services offered through HUD's Housing Counseling Grant Programs.

05/31/2019:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2019/pr19-086.cfm,HUD Charges Idaho Landlords with Discriminating Against Families with Children,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is charging the owners and manager of a rental home in Nampa, Idaho, with violating the Fair Housing Act by refusing to rent the home to a married couple because they have children. Read the charge.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to deny or limit housing because a family has children under the age of 18, make statements that discriminate against families with children, and impose different rules, restriction and policies on them.
""Denying a couple a place to live because they have children robs them of the opportunity to establish a stable home for their family and is a violation of the law,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Today's action reinforces HUD's commitment to protecting the right of every home seeker to obtain housing, regardless of their family make-up.""
The case came to HUD's attention when a mother of seven saw an ad on Craigslist for a rental home for $1,200 a month that consisted of 2,600 square feet, four bedrooms, three bathrooms, two living rooms and two bonus rooms. HUD's charge alleges that the woman called the property manager, who is also the owners' son, to inquire about the home and was told that the property was available. The manager also stated that the lease required that the first month's rent of $1,200 be paid, along with a $1,000 deposit and a $200 payment toward the last month's rent.
The charge further alleges that a day later, the couple, accompanied by two of their children, went to view the property, fill out the rental application, and pay the required deposits. They met with the property manager, who asked them if the two children with them were the couple's only children. According to the charge, when the woman replied that she and her husband have seven children, the manager immediately gestured that she should stop completing the application and told her that he did not want to waste their time, as the owners had set a four-children limit for the home. When the mother later sent a text message to the manager stating that the law generally allows two people per room, so the house has more than enough space, the manager allegedly replied, ""Sorry, I'm just following the contract my parents have written out.""
""The Fair Housing Act requires that all Americans must have equal access to housing opportunities regardless of their race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, or familial status,"" said HUD General Counsel Paul Compton. ""HUD has a duty to enforce these rights, and this case demonstrates our continuing commitment to that duty.""
The charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party elects for the case to be heard in federal court. If the administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he or she may award damages to the complainants for their loss as a result of the discrimination. The judge may also order other injunctive or equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties to vindicate the public interest.
Persons who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY)."

06/20/2019:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2019/pr19-090.cfm,HUD Charges New York Housing Providers with Discriminating Against Resident with Disabilities,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced it is charging a New York property owner and manager with housing discrimination.
HUD alleges that James W. Ray Jr., Jim Ray Homes, Inc., and Shelter Valley, LLC, the owners and manager of Shelter Valley Mobile Home Park in Newfield, Tompkins County, New York, refused to allow a mother to have an assistance animal for her son, who has a mental disability, and retaliated against the family for exercising their fair housing rights. Read HUD's charge.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from denying or limiting housing to people with disabilities, or from refusing to make reasonable accommodations in policies or practices for people with disabilities. This includes not allowing people with disabilities (impairments that substantially limit major life activities) to have assistance animals that perform work or tasks, or that provide disability-related emotional support. In addition, the Act prohibits housing providers from retaliating against people who exercise their fair housing rights, such as filing a complaint with HUD.
""Individuals with disabilities have a right to the accommodations they need, including the use of assistance animals,"" said Anna Maria Farias, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Today's action reaffirms HUD's commitment to taking appropriate action when housing providers fail to meet their obligations under the Fair Housing Act.""
The case came to HUD's attention when the mother of a child with mental disabilities filed a complaint alleging that the owners and manager of Shelter Valley would not allow her son to have an assistance animal. HUD's charge alleges that the owner and manager also required the family to provide documentation stating that their dog was an adult and under 20 pounds, despite the fact that the Tompkins County Office of Human Rights informed him that the Fair Housing Act does not limit the size of a service animal. After the woman filed her complaint with HUD, the owner tried to evict the family, so they moved out of their home.
""HUD is committed to ensuring that housing providers offer tenants and family members with disabilities equal opportunities to use and enjoy the dwellings that they are renting,"" said J. Paul Compton Jr., HUD's General Counsel. ""Efforts to evict a family because they seek to avail themselves of their fair housing rights are illegal.""
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party elects for the case to be heard in federal court. If the judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he or she may award damages to the complainant and her son for their losses, injunctive relief, and other equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties in order to vindicate the public interest.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to hud.gov/fair housing, or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, which can be accessed through Apple and Android devices."

06/21/2019:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2019/pr19-091.cfm,HUD Applauds EPA Step to Further Protect Children from Exposure to Lead Contaminated Dust,"WASHINGTON - HUD congratulates the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for issuing new, tighter standards for lead in dust on floors and windowsills to protect children from the harmful effects of lead exposure. EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler, along with HUD Secretary Ben Carson, announced the standards that Administrator Wheeler signed today.
""EPA's efforts to update its standards for lead dust on floors and windowsills in pre-1978 homes and child-occupied facilities is an important step forward,"" said Secretary Carson. ""We will look to complement the EPA move by using this new standard to update the lead safety requirements for pre-1978 housing.""
""EPA is delivering on our commitment in the Trump Administration's Federal Lead Action Plan to take important steps to reduce childhood lead exposure,"" said EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler. ""Today's final rule is the first time in nearly two decades EPA is issuing a stronger, more protective standard for lead dust in homes and child care facilities across the country.""
Since the 1970s, the United States has made tremendous progress in lowering children's blood lead levels. In 2001, EPA set standards for lead in dust for floors and windowsills in housing, however since that time, the best available science has evolved to indicate human health effects at lower blood lead levels than previously analyzed.
To protect children's health and to continue making progress on this important issue, EPA is lowering the dust-lead hazard standards from 40 micrograms of lead per square foot (µg/ft2 ) to 10 µg/ft2 on floors and from 250 µg/ft2 to 100 µg/ft2 on windowsills. The revised, more protective standards lower the level of lead in dust that may warrant measures to reduce risks. The expectation is that the update will become effective near the end of this year.
Lead-contaminated dust from chipped or peeling lead-based paint is one of the most common causes of elevated blood lead levels in children. Infants and children are especially vulnerable to lead paint exposure because their growing bodies absorb more lead than adults do, and their brains and nervous systems are more sensitive to the damaging effects of lead. They can be exposed from multiple sources and may experience irreversible and life-long health effects. Lead dust can be generated when lead-based paint deteriorates or is disturbed.

Background
Reducing childhood lead exposure and addressing associated health impacts is a top priority for HUD, EPA, and the other federal agencies on the federal Children's Environmental Health Task Force. In December 2018, HUD, EPA, HHS, and other Federal partners released the Lead Action Plan, a blueprint for reducing lead exposure and associated harms by working with a range of stakeholders, including states, tribes, and local communities, along with businesses, property owners, and parents.
HUD, EPA, HHS, and their Task Force partners continue to work with their federal partners to improve coordinated activities and implement objectives of the Lead Action Plan."
06/21/2019:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2019/pr19-094.cfm,HUD Charges Minnesota Landlords with Housing Discrimination,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced that it is charging the owners of several rental homes in Ottertail, Minnesota, with housing discrimination. According to HUD, the owners allegedly refused to allow a single mother to live with an assistance animal, a cat, for her oldest daughter, who has mental disabilities, and for terminating her lease agreement in response to the mother's reasonable-accommodation request. Read HUD's charge.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from denying or limiting housing to people with disabilities, or from refusing to make reasonable accommodations in policies or practices for people with disabilities. This includes not allowing people with disabilities (impairments that substantially limit major life activities) to have assistance animals that perform work or tasks, or that provide disability-related emotional support. In addition, the Act prohibits housing providers from retaliating against people who exercise their fair housing rights, such as filing a complaint with HUD.
""For individuals with mental disabilities, assistance animals provide the support they need to perform life's daily tasks,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Today's action demonstrates HUD's ongoing commitment to taking appropriate action when housing providers fail to meet their obligations to comply with the Fair Housing Act.""
""When an individual is entitled to a reasonable accommodation under the Fair Housing Act, a housing provider is obligated to provide it,"" said HUD General Counsel Paul Compton. ""HUD is committed to holding housing providers responsible for any failure to follow the law.""
The case came to HUD's attention when a mother of three minor children filed a complaint alleging that the owners of a townhouse refused to rent her the home for which she had signed a lease agreement because she asked them to permit her oldest daughter's assistance animal to live in the home. HUD's charge alleges that the owners refused to allow the assistance animal in the home, even though the woman provided documentation from her daughter's therapist attesting to the need for the assistance animal and how it addressed the girl's condition. Concurrently with the denial of the reasonable-accommodation request, the owners terminated the lease agreement before the family could even move in. HUD's charge further alleges that the woman informed the owners of their responsibilities under the Fair Housing Act and its protections for individuals with disabilities and asked that they reconsider her request. The owners refused to do so, and the family was forced to find other housing.
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party elects for the case to be heard in federal court. If the administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages to the complainant and her family for their losses that have resulted from the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties in order to vindicate the public interest.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY).

New Home Sales
Sales of new single-family houses in May 2019 were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 626,000. This is 7.8 percent (±14.7 percent)* below the revised April rate of 679,000 and is 3.7 percent (±15.0 percent)* below the May 2018 estimate of 650,000.
Sales Price
The median sales price of new houses sold in May 2019 was $308,000. The average sales price was $377,200.
For Sale Inventory and Months' Supply
The seasonally adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of May was 333,000. This represents a supply of 6.4 months at the current sales rate.

EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take three months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, six months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2 percent) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percentage change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percentage changes are 90 percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percentage changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised 3 percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at the Census Bureau's website (www.census.gov/construction/nrs/how_the_data_are_collected/index.html).
* The 90 percent confidence interval includes zero. In such cases, there is insufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero."
06/25/2019:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2019/pr19-096.cfm,HUD Secretary Ben Carson to Chair White House Council on Affordable Housing,"WASHINGTON - Today, President Donald Trump signed an Executive Order establishing the White House Council on Eliminating Barriers to Affordable Housing, and named Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson as its chairperson.
The Council will consist of members across eight Federal agencies and engage with State, local, and tribal leaders across the country to identify and remove the obstacles that impede the production of affordable homes – namely, the enormous price tag that follow burdensome government regulations.
""With the signing of today's Executive Order, President Trump is prescribing a powerful treatment that correctly diagnoses the source of America's affordable housing condition: this is a matter of supply and demand, and we have to increase the supply of affordable homes by changing the cost side of the equation,"" said Secretary Carson. ""Increasing the supply of housing by removing overly burdensome rules and regulations will reduce housing costs, boost economic growth, and provide more Americans with opportunities for economic mobility.""
Research indicates that more than 25% of the cost of a new home is the direct result of Federal, State, and local regulations. For this reason, in recent years, the construction of new multifamily and single-family dwellings has not kept pace with the formation of new households. Census Bureau data indicates that from 2010 to 2016, only seven homes were built for every 10 households formed. As a result, Americans have fewer housing opportunities, including the opportunity to achieve sustainable homeownership, which is the number one builder of wealth for most American families.
To curtail burdensome regulations, the Council will be tasked with accomplishing the following items by January 2021:
• Work across agencies, States, local governments, tribal governments, and private-sector stakeholders to identify policies that artificially increase the cost of developing affordable housing.
• Report on the quantifiable effect that Federal, State, local, and tribal regulatory barriers have on affordable housing development, the economy, and society.
• Take action to reduce Federal regulatory and administrative burdens that discourage private investment and housing development;
• Take action within existing Federal programs to align and support local, and tribal state efforts to reduce regulatory and administrative burdens that discourage housing development.
• Recommend Federal, State, local, and tribal policies that would: Reduce and streamline statutory, regulatory, and administrative burdens that inhibit the development of affordable housing supply at all levels of government; Incentivize State, local, and tribal governments to reduce barriers to affordable housing development.
Reduce and streamline statutory, regulatory, and administrative burdens that inhibit the development of affordable housing supply at all levels of government; Incentivize State, local, and tribal governments to reduce barriers to affordable housing development.
• Reduce and streamline statutory, regulatory, and administrative burdens that inhibit the development of affordable housing supply at all levels of government;
• Incentivize State, local, and tribal governments to reduce barriers to affordable housing development."
06/27/2019:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2019/pr19-097.cfm,HUD Offers Record $330 Million to Clean Up Dangerous Lead and Other Hazards in Housing,"WASHINGTON - The U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today announced a record $330 million in grants to clean up lead-based paint hazards and other housing-related health and safety hazards in low-income housing.
Click here (www.youtube.com/watch?v=oN1zWgZ7eUs&feature=youtu.be) or on the video below to view Secretary Carson talking about the importance of this grant award.
These grants are provided through HUD's Lead Hazard Reduction (www.grants.gov/web/grants/search-grants.html?keywords=FR-6300-N-13) and Healthy Homes Production for Tribal Housing (www.grants.gov/web/grants/search-grants.html?keywords=FR-6200-N-44) grant programs and will direct critical funds to qualifying cities, counties, states and Native American tribal governments to eliminate dangerous lead paint hazards. Additionally, HUD has added a category of cities and counties that have ""high impact neighborhoods"" with high concentrations of both pre-1940 housing, low-income families, and high rates of young children with elevated blood lead levels.
""Your home is a haven from the outside world. You shouldn't be worried about the hidden dangers that could affect you and your family,"" said Secretary Ben Carson. ""Housing conditions directly affect the health of its residents. Grants like these will help communities around the nation protect themselves from the danger of lead exposure and other health and safety hazards.""
Matthew Ammon, Director of HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes, added, ""By providing these grants, HUD makes it clear that providing healthy and safe homes for the community is a priority. A key part of having a healthy home is maintaining your own health. HUD is committed to protecting families from these hazards and providing healthy and sustainable housing.""
Through these grants programs, HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes promotes local efforts to eliminate dangerous lead hazards from lower income homes, stimulates private sector investment in lead hazard control, and educates the public about the dangers of lead-based paint.
Lead Hazard Control Grant Programs
Although lead-based paint was banned for residential use in 1978, HUD estimates that about 24 million homes built before then still have significant lead-based paint hazards today. Lead-contaminated dust is the primary cause of lead exposure and can lead to a variety of health problems in young children, including reduced IQ, learning disabilities, developmental delays, reduced height, and impaired hearing. At higher levels, lead can damage a child's kidneys and central nervous system and cause anemia, coma, convulsions and even death.
HUD is making grants available through the following programs:
Lead Hazard Reduction: $324 Million
The purpose of this program is to maximize the number of children under the age of six years protected from lead poisoning by assisting grantees in undertaking comprehensive programs to identify and control lead-based paint hazards in eligible privately-owned target housing. This year, HUD has added a category of cities and counties that have ""high impact neighborhoods"" with high concentrations of [both] pre-1940 housing, low-income families, and [high rates of] young children with elevated blood lead levels. These five-year grants will be for up to $9.1 million each. In the second grant category, HUD will award 42-month grants of up to $5 million each for controlling lead-based paint hazards in communities with large numbers of occupied pre-1940 rental housing. Other eligible applicants may apply to do this lead hazard control work with 42-month grants of up to $4 million each. Applicants that have never had a HUD lead hazard control grant are eligible for a 42-month grant of up to $3 million each. Application due date: Friday, August 9, 2019.

Read HUD's Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA).
HUD's Continuum of Care homeless assistance grants support a wide variety of local programs from street outreach and assessment programs to transitional and permanent housing for individuals, including, veterans, youth, families, and persons experiencing long-term or chronic homelessness.
""While housing first is critical and necessary to place our most vulnerable on a path to self-sufficiency, we should be mindful not to define success as a Washington routine to check a box, shelter someone - indefinitely - and ask for more money the next year,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""We want to ensure that awards are granted to programs that prove to be successful in a meaningful way based on an evidence-based performance.""
""Today we announce another historic investment to house and serve our most vulnerable neighbors living in our shelters and, too frequently, on our streets,"" said David C. Woll, Jr., HUD Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary, Office of Community Planning and Development. ""HUD will continue to work closely with our local partners to support those programs that are proving most effective in reducing and even ending homelessness in their neighborhoods.""
Through the Continuum of Care grant competition, HUD is encouraging communities to pursue evidence-based approaches to end veteran, chronic, family, and youth homelessness and to use their data to strategically target their available resources to end homelessness. To help communities reach these goals, there is greater flexibility provided to create a variety of new projects that will allow recipients to serve different populations of individuals and families experiencing homelessness as well as to support increased data collection and analysis.
HUD requires prospective grantees to submit applications electronically at https://esnaps.hud.gov/.

TOP is a unique and innovative accelerator program that matches tech companies, universities, government, and communities together to create useful digital products for the public. The summer of 2019 challenge-which will be co-led by the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA)-is entitled ""Catalyzing Investment in Opportunity Zones,"" with the purpose of creating ""digital tools and resources to connect investors with community leaders, entrepreneurs, and workers"" of the nation's Opportunity Zones. Read more about the TOP initiative (https://opportunity.census.gov/sprints).
""HUD is pleased that leading innovators from across the country are directly taking on the challenge of developing products to help people invest in Opportunity Zones,"" Secretary Ben Carson said. ""We also want to thank the Census Bureau and the other agencies participating in this summer's Opportunity Project. Working together, we collaborate with the private sector to solve some of the most pressing issues facing Americans in economically distressed areas. This project will help ensure that Opportunity Zone stakeholders have access to the best data, innovation, and expertise as investment continues to flow into these underserved areas.""
""Government, the technology industry, and the communities that comprise Opportunity Zones all have a significant role to play in establishing new products and services that can benefit the Americans who need them most,"" said Scott Turner, Executive Director of the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council.
The Opportunity Project utilizes the expertise of professionals from across government, the technology sector, and private business to focus on a specific challenge during designated 'sprints.' The final products will be shared in Washington, D.C. in December 2019.
The Opportunity Challenge is a part of the work Secretary Carson is undertaking as the Chair of the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council. The Council's 16 Federal member agencies and Federal-State partnerships are engaging with governments at all levels-State, local, tribal, and Territorial- and the private sector on ways to more effectively use taxpayer dollars to revitalize low-income communities.
President Trump signed the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, creating Opportunity Zones to stimulate long-term investments in low-income communities. The program offers capital gains tax relief to those who invest in these distressed areas. This program is anticipated to spur $100 billion in private capital investment in Opportunity Zones. Incentivizing investment in low-income communities fosters economic revitalization, job creation, and promotes sustainable economic growth across the nation, especially in communities HUD serves. Read more about Opportunity Zones (www.irs.gov/newsroom/tax-reform-creates-opportunity-zone-tax-incentive).
Opportunity Zones are a powerful vehicle for bringing economic growth and job creation to the American communities that need it the most. On average, the median family income in an Opportunity Zone is 37 percent below the state median. Overall, more than 8,700 communities in all 50 States, Washington D.C., and five U.S. territories have been designated as Opportunity Zones. Nearly 35 million Americans live in communities designated as Opportunity Zones."
07/10/2019:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2019/pr19-101.cfm,HUD Charges Texas Landlords with Race Discrimination,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced that it is charging Plano, Texas, landlords Quang Dangtran and his wife, Ha Nguyen, with violating the Fair Housing Act by refusing to lease a room to a prospective tenant because she is black. Read HUD's charge.
The Fair Housing Act makes it illegal to discriminate in housing because of race or color, which includes making discriminatory statements with respect to the rental of a dwelling.
""A person's race should never determine whether or not they have access to a place to call home,"" said Anna Maria Farias, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Today's action reflects HUD's ongoing commitment to taking appropriate action when the Fair Housing Act has been violated.""
HUD's charge alleges that in advertising on craigslist for a room in a five-bedroom house, Mr. Dangtran required applicants to identify their race and submit a photograph of themselves. When Complainant, a woman who had expressed an interest in renting, contacted Mr. Dangtran about the rental, he reiterated his request for a picture or ""selfie"". HUD's charge further alleges that although the woman refused, Dangtran later agreed to meet her at the house but when he saw that she is black, he refused to show her the room, stating that her race would make his wife and the other tenants uncomfortable.
""In 2019, more than 50 years after enactment of the Fair Housing Act, it should be universally known and accepted that racial discrimination in housing is illegal and unacceptable,"" said Paul Compton, HUD's General Counsel. ""When HUD becomes aware of such discrimination, it will aggressively pursue remedies provided for by law.""
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party elects for the case to be heard in federal court. If the administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages to the complainant for her loss as a result of the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties in order to vindicate the public interest.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to hud.gov/fair housing, or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, which can be accessed through Apple and Android devices."
07/11/2019:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2019/pr19-102.cfm,HUD Charges Maine Apartment Owner with Discrimination for Denying Assistance Animal to Veteran with Disabilities,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is charging Roderick Apartments, LLC in Clinton, Maine, and one of its agents with discrimination for denying a veteran with disabilities the right to keep his assistance animal. Read HUD's charge.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from denying or limiting housing to people with disabilities, or from refusing to make reasonable accommodations in policies or practices for people with disabilities. This includes not allowing people with disabilities (impairments that substantially limit major life activities) to have assistance animals that perform work or tasks, or that provide disability-related emotional support.
""No person with a disability should be denied the accommodation they need, especially individuals who served in the Armed Forces to defend our freedom,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will continue to work to ensure that housing providers meet their obligation to comply with this nation's fair housing laws.""
The case came to HUD's attention when a veteran with disabilities filed a complaint alleging that Roderick Apartments refused to lease an apartment to him because he uses a dog as an assistance animal. HUD's Charge alleges that tests subsequently conducted by Pine Tree Legal Assistance (PTLA), a nonprofit agency that provides free civil and legal assistance to low- income Maine residents, confirmed Roderick Apartments' policy of refusing to rent to persons with an assistance animal. In one test, a PTLA tester posing as an apartment seeker who uses an assistance animal allegedly was told that having the animal would be grounds for eviction.
""Fair Housing Act charges on the basis of disability demonstrate HUD's continued commitment to ensuring that housing providers offer equal opportunities to all persons looking to rent a home,"" said Paul Compton, HUD's General Counsel.
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party elects for the case to be heard in federal court. If the administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages to the complainant for his loss as a result of the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties in order to vindicate the public interest.

The City of Rochester has a long history of adopting and implementing proactive code enforcement programs. Two programs that have had the greatest impact on the health and safety of residents are the Renewable Certificate of Occupancy (C of O) Program and the Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Ordinance. These programs, when combined with the efforts of the City's community partners, have reduced the number of children with elevated blood levels by 99% since 1994 and by 85% since the adoption of the lead ordinance in 2005. This has made a measurable difference in the lives of Rochester's children.
Partnership Between American Association of Radon Scientists and Technologists (AARST) in North Carolina and HUD Multifamily Program
The partnership between the American Association of Radon Scientists and Technologists, a non-profit organization, and the HUD Multifamily Program involved implementing and strengthening the HUD Office of Multifamily Development Radon Policy issued in 2013. The policy is a vital component of the multifamily program at HUD, enjoying strong support from radon professionals and other stakeholders. Since its issuance, AARST and HUD Multifamily have partnered multiple times to educate HUD personnel, radon professionals, lenders and other stakeholders about the policy and how it can best be implemented, through webinars, articles in publications, presentations at conferences, and other methods."

EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take three months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, six months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2 percent) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percentage change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percentage changes are 90 percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percentage changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised 3 percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at the Census Bureau's website (www.census.gov/construction/nrc/how_the_data_are_collected/index.html).
* The 90 percent confidence interval includes zero. In such cases, there is insufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero."

Read the Agreement.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to refuse to rent or to impose different rental terms on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, disability or familial status.
""Individuals renting units at apartment complexes have a right to use any amenities that are available, and this applies to families who have children,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""We're pleased that the owners and managers of Meadow Ridge agreed to resolve this matter and we will continue working with other housing providers to help them meet their obligations under the Fair Housing Act.""
The case came to HUD's attention when a mother residing at Meadow Ridge Apartments filed a complaint alleging that the property manager made her son and other children leave a recreational area of the complex after observing the children playing without their parents observing. The woman's complaint further alleged that the owner and manager maintained an unwritten policy that children could not use common spaces without adult supervision. The owner and manager deny that they discriminated against the woman but agreed to settle the complaint.
Under the terms of the agreement, the owner and manager will pay $5,000 to the mother and allow her, if she chooses, to terminate her lease after a 30-day written notice without penalty. Additionally, the owner and manager will provide fair housing training for its employees and circulate a letter to residents stating that children do not need to be supervised in order to use the development's common areas.

This agreement settles allegations that Boardwalk Townhomes discriminated against African American home seekers. Read the Agreement.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to impose different terms or conditions on the sale of a dwelling based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, or disability.
""A person's race should never be a factor in determining whether they have the opportunity to obtain the housing of their choice,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Today's settlement represents HUD's ongoing commitment to ensuring that individuals in positions to affect access to housing meet their obligation to comply with the Fair Housing Act.""
The case came to HUD's attention when The Fair Housing Council of Riverside County (FHCRC), a HUD Fair Housing Initiatives Program agency, filed a complaint alleging that fair housing tests it conducted showed that real estate agents for CADO Real Estate Group treated testers posing as African-American home seekers less favorably than testers posing as white home seekers. Specifically, FHCRC alleged that its tests showed that African-American testers were told that there were no homes available when there were and were required to meet tougher pre-qualification requirements than white testers. CADO Real Estate Group, LCG Harrington, LLC, and their agents deny having engaged in any discriminatory behavior.
Under the terms of the agreement, CADO Real Estate Group will pay $10,000 to FHCRC, and its agents will attend fair housing training.

EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take three months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, six months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2 percent) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percentage change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percentage changes are 90 percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percentage changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised 3 percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at the Census Bureau's website (www.census.gov/construction/nrs/how_the_data_are_collected/index.html).
* The 90 percent confidence interval includes zero. In such cases, there is insufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero."
07/26/2019:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2019/pr19-111.cfm,HUD Launches Initiative to Prevent and End Homelessness Among Young People Aging out of Foster Care,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson today announced a new initiative to target housing assistance to young people aging out of foster care and who are at extreme risk of experiencing homelessness. HUD's new Foster Youth to Independence (FYI) Initiative will offer housing vouchers to local public housing authorities to prevent or end homelessness among young adults under the age of 25 who are, or have recently left, the foster care system without a home to go to. Read HUD's notice.
Secretary Carson made the announcement at Journey House in Milwaukee, a local program that empowers families to move out of poverty by offering a variety of services, including youth development.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) estimates that more than 20,000 young people age out of foster care each year. The National Center for Housing and Child Welfare (NCHCW) estimates that approximately 25 percent of these young people experience homelessness within four years of leaving foster care and an even higher share are precariously housed.
""No young person who grows up in foster care should experience homelessness once they set out on their own,"" said HUD Secretary Carson. ""The foundation of a stable life is stable housing and this initiative will allow local housing, working child welfare agencies and homeless planners, to focus this housing assistance to those young people who need it most.""
""We applaud Secretary Carson and his team for working directly with current and former foster youth to design and implement FYI as a platform for economic success,"" said Ruth White, National Center for Housing and Child Welfare. ""It's only fitting that a former pediatric neurosurgeon would find a way to graft housing and social service programs together to close the gaps through which all too many children fall into homelessness on their way to adulthood.""
HUD is offering tenant-protection vouchers to certain public housing authorities (many located in smaller communities and rural areas) that do not participate in HUD's Family Unification Program. In addition, participating public housing authorities must:
Administer a Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) Program; Enter into a partnership agreement with a Public Child Welfare Agency (PCWA); Accept young people referred by their partnering PCWA; Determine that the referred youth are eligible for HCV assistance.
• Administer a Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) Program;
• Enter into a partnership agreement with a Public Child Welfare Agency (PCWA);
• Accept young people referred by their partnering PCWA;
• Determine that the referred youth are eligible for HCV assistance.
HUD's FYI Initiative is generating a positive reaction from members of Congress deeply engaged on the issue of foster care:
As a founding member of the Senate Caucus on Foster Youth, Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley said, ""One of the biggest challenges facing older youth who age out of foster care is housing. This initiative will make it easier for former foster youth to access federal housing assistance so they can continue their education, get a job and have a good start as they transition into adulthood.""
Nebraska Congressman Don Bacon, co-chair of the House Caucus on Foster Youth, said, ""As young people age out of the foster care system, most times they are left without resources and support as they transition to adulthood. This initiative will give foster youth who are at extreme risk of falling into homelessness access to stable housing. Any investment we make in these young persons can help them grow to be successful members of the community. Strengthening federal support to end youth homelessness, is not just an investment in foster youth but in society as a whole.""
Ohio Congressman Mike Turner added, ""For years, I've been an advocate for addressing the housing needs of our foster care youth. I strongly support Secretary Carson's commitment to addressing this issue, and I am continuing working on this issue legislatively to advance the Fostering Stable Housing Opportunities Act. Right now, we have a situation of federally created homelessness as foster care youth age out of the system. Aging out of foster care should not mean aging into homelessness."""
07/29/2019:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2019/pr19-112.cfm,HUD Order Settles Claims of Discrimination against New Jersey Apartment Owner,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that Hudson Harbour Condominium Association in Edgewater, New Jersey, will pay $30,000 pursuant to a Consent Order resolving allegations that they discriminated against a resident with disabilities by denying her the right to have a dog as an assistance animal. Read the Order.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from denying or limiting housing to persons with disabilities or from refusing to make reasonable accommodations in policies or practices. This includes not allowing people with disabilities (impairments that substantially limit major life activities) to have assistance animals that perform work or tasks, or that provide disability-related emotional support.
""No person with a disability should be denied the reasonable accommodation they need to make a home for themselves,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Hopefully, today's action will remind homeowner associations of their obligations under the Fair Housing Act and encourage them to follow the law.""
The Consent Order is the result of a charge that HUD filed against Hudson Harbour Condominium Association in October 2018, alleging that the Association discriminated against a resident with disabilities for having an assistance animal. HUD's charge alleged that the Association required the resident, who is a person with hearing and sight disabilities, to cage her animal in common areas and use the service entrance when entering and exiting the building with the animal.
Under the Order, the Association will pay $30,000 to the resident and adopt a reasonable accommodation policy, approved by HUD, that complies with the Fair Housing Act. In addition, Association board members and employees who have contact with residents of the building will attend fair housing training.
""As the primary agency tasked with enforcing the Fair Housing Act, HUD works to protect the right to housing free from discrimination, including for individuals with disabilities,"" said Paul Compton, HUD's General Counsel.
Persons who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (Voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY).

Read the agreement.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits financial institutions from discriminating on the basis of race or national origin in their mortgage lending services. This includes redlining, which is the practice of denying credit to residents of predominantly minority neighborhoods.
""Homeownership is the foundation of the American dream,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Today's settlement is an important step toward ensuring access to that dream for all borrowers, regardless of their race or national origin.""
OneWest Bank is a retail bank with 60 branches in Southern California. The complaint, filed by the California Reinvestment Coalition (CRC), alleged that from 2014 to at least 2017 OneWest Bank discriminated in the marketing and origination of home mortgages, as evidenced by the low number of mortgages it made to African-American and Latino borrowers relative to the demographics of the area and to the industry as a whole. The complaint also alleged that the bank located and maintained branches in areas that do not serve minority neighborhoods and borrowers. OneWest Bank denies discriminating in violation of the Act, but has entered into the Conciliation Agreement to provide ""important and valuable assistance to minority communities in its service areas.""
As part of the settlement, OneWest Bank will invest $5 million in a loan subsidy fund to increase credit opportunities for residents of majority-minority neighborhoods; devote $1.3 million toward advertising and community outreach; and provide $1 million in grants for homebuyer education, credit counseling, community revitalization, and homeless programs. OneWest Bank is also committing to originate $100,000,000 in home purchase, home improvement and home refinance loans to borrowers in majority-minority areas, and to open a full-service branch serving the banking and credit needs of residents in a majority-minority and low- and moderate-income neighborhood.

08/01/2019:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2019/pr19-114.cfm,HUD Announces Agency Efforts to Reduce Risk from Cash-Out Refinance Lending,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced joint policy actions designed to reduce risk associated with cash-out refinance lending. The changes preserve homeowners' ability to convert home equity to cash via a government-sponsored mortgage but also improves the risk profile of HUD's housing finance programs.
To address these concerns, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) will lower its maximum loan-to-value (LTV) requirements for cash-out refinance transactions from 85 percent to 80 percent. This policy change will be effective for loans with case numbers assigned on or after September 1, 2019 and aligns with the maximum cash-out LTV allowed by the Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs). Read FHA's mortgagee letter.
Meanwhile, the Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae) is taking further action to manage risks associated with 'loan churning' among mortgages insured by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Rapid, serial refinancing has proven to deplete home equity and wealth for veterans with VA-insured mortgages and harmed investor confidence in mortgage-backed securities (MBS) that Ginnie Mae guarantees. Read Ginnie Mae's press release (www.ginniemae.gov/newsroom/Pages/PressReleaseDispPage.aspx?ParamID=173).
""We are taking another important step to support sustainable homeownership that builds wealth for families,"" said Federal Housing Commissioner Brian Montgomery. ""This is a prudent measure to make certain that we protect and preserve the home equity borrowers are building for their futures and guard against taxpayer losses from the FHA program.""
""Today's announcement underscores Ginnie Mae's commitment to ensuring the agency's policies enable homeowners to borrow prudently, utilizing the government-guaranteed mortgage market"" said Ginnie Mae Acting President, Maren Kasper, ""Additionally, this policy provides global investors with increased certainty in the performance of the Ginnie Mae security, which ultimately lowers mortgage rates for all borrowers served by our program.""
Background
FHA - Prior to the housing recession a decade ago, borrowers increasingly turned to cash-out refinances during a period of home price appreciation. When home prices declined in the wake of the housing collapse, many homeowners found themselves with negative equity, forcing many into foreclosure. FHA last adjusted the maximum LTV on cash-out refinances from 95 percent to 85 percent in 2009 in response to the weakening housing market and has been closely monitoring the risk associated with cash-out refinances.
According to FHA's latest annual report to Congress, cash-out refinances continue to represent a large and growing segment (64 percent) of all FHA-insured refinance transactions and accounted for 15 percent of all forward mortgage endorsements. This increasing share of cash-out refinances is attributed to recent home prices increases and the decline of other forms of refinance activity. This further adjustment to its maximum LTV requirements will permit FHA to mitigate this risk and, importantly, preserve FHA-insured borrowers' wealth. Today's announcement also aligns the FHA's maximum LTV requirements with those of the GSEs, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
GINNIE MAE - The Ginnie Mae II Multi-Issuer Program (GII MIP) represents nearly 90 percent of the agency's mortgage-backed security (MBS) issuance. Strong market acceptance of the GII MIP has been crucial to enabling Ginnie Mae to fulfill its mission of facilitating low-cost financing for American homeowners and the federal housing finance programs it's intended to serve. Ginnie Mae is vigilant about any trend that impairs the integrity of the security.
Today's policy announcement Ginnie Mae outlines revisions to the pooling eligibility requirements applicable to all VA-guaranteed refinance loans and establishes new pooling criteria for certain cash-out refinances with LTV ratios exceeding 90 percent (as outlined in the agency's previously published Request for Information (www.ginniemae.gov/newsroom/publications/Documents/ginniemae_rfi_va.pdf)). Effective with MBS guaranteed on or after November 1, 2019, high LTV VA Cash-Out Refinance Loans (those with LTV ratios above 90 percent) are ineligible for Ginnie Mae I Single Issuer Pools and Ginnie Mae II Multiple Issuer Pools, except in cases when the loans are Permanent Financing Construction Loans (as defined in Chapter 24 of the MBS Guide).
High LTV VA Cash-Out Refinances may be pooled into Ginnie Mae II Custom Pools without restriction, provided they satisfy the seasoning and number of payment requirements detailed in Chapter 24, Part 2 § (A)(3)(d).
The actual and projected extent of loan prepayment is a primary concern of MBS investors, particularly when an above-par price has been paid for the security in which the prepayment occurs. Prepayment risk is a well-understood feature of the MBS asset class and is the subject of extensive loan-level analysis that supports the liquidity of the securities. However, for MBS security
investors, concerns arise when investment losses are borne as the result of refinance activity that appears not to correlate with economic fundamentals. Cash-out refinance programs are particularly susceptible to accelerated prepayment speeds, which is why Ginnie Mae is restricting the inclusion of such loans to custom MBS securities. This allows for greater market transparency for investors pricing Ginnie Mae securities."

The agreement announced today resolves longstanding HUD findings of noncompliance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act. This settlement paves the way for HUD to continue funding the City under the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and HOME Investment Partnerships programs.
The ground-breaking settlement anticipates the development of 10,000 units of new affordable housing over the next ten years, including 1,500 accessible units for individuals with disabilities, a share that exceeds current state and federal requirements. The City further commits to providing 3,100 accessible housing units for individuals with disabilities by retrofitting hundreds of existing affordable housing developments across the City that were not constructed or rehabilitated to meet federal accessibility standards. Read the agreement.
In addition, the City and HUD will work together on an innovative ""Enhanced Accessibility Program"" that will incorporate cutting-edge accessibility features into future affordable housing developments. The features provided through this program will include many accessibility enhancements that are not yet contemplated in the minimum standards established by state and federal law. Read more about the agreement announced today.
""As a result of this settlement, thousands of individuals with disabilities, including those experiencing homelessness in the City of Los Angeles, will have equal access to affordable housing and access to cutting-edge features that will enable them to live independently,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""I'm pleased we can now turn a page and begin the real work of providing affordable housing to the people who need it most and have gone without it for too long.""
HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, Anna Maria Farias, explained ""The scope and scale of this agreement is unprecedented, and we are unaware of an accessibility commitment of this magnitude. I'm happy that the City will finally deliver accessible housing to Angelinos with disabilities and will be working with HUD to fulfill the promises of this in the years to come.""
HUD's General Counsel Paul Compton Jr. noted ""HUD grantees should pay attention to this agreement. HUD expects its grantees to comply with the requirements of fair housing and civil rights laws. We will use the legal tools at our disposal to protect the rights of individuals with disabilities to live in affordable, accessible housing.""
Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance. Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in all programs, services, and activities of local governments.

The funding announced today is offered through HUD's Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS Program (HOPWA) (www.hudexchange.info/programs/hopwa) and will renew HUD's support of 25 local programs. These grants provide a combination of housing assistance and supportive services for this vulnerable population.
""HUD is committed to ensuring the best outcomes for HIV and AIDS survivors in our care,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""Through the combination of supportive services and stable housing, we will be able to assist in bringing healing to these individuals and their communities.""
Research shows that a stable home is critical to the well-being of persons living with HIV/AIDS, and results in better health outcomes and reduced transmission of the disease. In addition to housing assistance, these local programs will provide access to supportive services such as case management, mental health services, substance abuse services, and employment training. The combination of housing assistance and supportive services are critical in sustaining housing stability, promoting better health outcomes, and increasing quality of life, which promotes self-sufficiency efforts for those able to transition to the private housing market.
Since 1992, HUD's HOPWA Program has provided national leadership and resources that support the development and operation of high-quality supportive housing programs. Under the HOPWA Program, HUD makes grants to cities, states, and nonprofit organizations to provide housing assistance and supportive services to low-income persons living with HIV/AIDS and their families. By providing assistance with housing and related services, the HOPWA program helps persons living with HIV/AIDS enter into housing, access and remain in medical care, and adhere to complex treatment regimens. More information on the HOPWA program is available at www.hudexchange.info/programs/hopwa/.

In a speech before an Opportunity Zone Expo in Brooklyn, New York, Secretary Carson said FHA can be a key partner for developers looking to invest in Opportunity Zones.
""By expanding this program's reach, we hope to significantly boost private investment in Opportunity Zones and generate growth in development in neighborhoods that need it most,"" said Secretary Carson. ""With expanded mixed-used development in Opportunity Zones comes economic revitalization and job growth which is just what the doctor ordered for residents living in these communities.""
Lamar Seats, HUD's Deputy Assistant Secretary for Multifamily Housing, said, ""We believe that the inclusion of all Opportunity Zones under the Section 220 program will promote more economic activity, both commercial and residential, in low-income, economically distressed areas that have not experienced a great deal of growth in recent years. Our hope is this will encourage increased lending in regions where affordable housing is most needed.""
FHA's Section 220 Program insures lenders against loss on mortgage default. Historically, Section 220 has provided good quality rental housing in downtown urban areas that have been targeted for overall revitalization. Today's announcement expands eligibility of mortgages insured under this program to all 8,764 Opportunity Zones, including those located in rural areas.
Background
President Trump signed the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, creating Opportunity Zones to stimulate long-term investments in low-income communities. Opportunity Zones offer capital gains tax relief to those who invest in these distressed areas. This initiative is anticipated to spur $100 billion in private capital investment in Opportunity Zones. Incentivizing investment in low-income communities fosters economic revitalization, job creation, and promotes sustainable economic growth across the nation, especially in communities HUD serves. Read more about Opportunity Zones (www.irs.gov/newsroom/tax-reform-creates-opportunity-zone-tax-incentive).
Opportunity Zones are a powerful vehicle for bringing economic growth and job creation to the American communities that need it the most. On average, the median family income in an Opportunity Zone is 37 percent below its respective state median. Overall, more than 8,700 communities in all 50 States, Washington D.C., and five U.S. territories have been designated as Opportunity Zones. Nearly 35 million Americans live in communities designated as Opportunity Zones."

Introduces a new single-unit approval process to make it easier for individual condominium units to be eligible for FHA-insured financing; Extends the recertification requirement for approved condominium projects from two to three years; Allows more mixed-use projects to be eligible for FHA insurance.
• Introduces a new single-unit approval process to make it easier for individual condominium units to be eligible for FHA-insured financing;
• Extends the recertification requirement for approved condominium projects from two to three years;
• Allows more mixed-use projects to be eligible for FHA insurance.
""Condominiums have increasingly become a source of affordable, sustainable homeownership for many families and it's critical that FHA be there to help them,"" said U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson. ""Today, we take an important step to open more doors to homeownership for younger, first-time American buyers as well as seniors hoping to age-in-place.""
HUD Acting Deputy Secretary and FHA Commissioner Brian Montgomery added, ""Today we are making certain FHA responds to what the market is telling us. This new rule allows FHA to meet its core mission to support eligible borrowers who are ready for homeownership and are most likely to enter the market with the purchase of a condominium.""
The vast majority (84 percent) of FHA-insured condo buyers have never owned a home before. While there are more than 150,000 condominium projects in the U.S., only 6.5 percent are approved to participate in FHA's mortgage insurance programs. As a result of FHA's new policy, it is estimated that 20,000 to 60,000 condominium units could become eligible for FHA-insured financing annually.
Single Family Policy Handbook Guidance
FHA's new Single Family Handbook sections published today provide the additional requirements that lenders and other industry participants need in order to implement FHA's new policy, including requirements for single-unit approvals, minimum owner occupancy requirements, and commercial/non-residential space limits. Read FHA's changes to its Single Family Handbook.
Single-Unit Approvals
As of October 15, FHA will insure mortgages for selected condominium units in projects that are not currently approved. An individual unit may be eligible for Single-Unit Approval under the following conditions:
The individual condominium unit is located in a completed project that is not approved; For condominium projects with 10 or more units, no more than 10 percent of individual condo units can be FHA-insured; and projects with fewer than 10 units may have no more than two FHA-insured units.
• The individual condominium unit is located in a completed project that is not approved;
• For condominium projects with 10 or more units, no more than 10 percent of individual condo units can be FHA-insured; and projects with fewer than 10 units may have no more than two FHA-insured units.
Minimum Owner-Occupancy Requirements
FHA will require that approved condominium projects have a minimum of 50 percent of the units occupied by owners for most projects.
FHA Insurance Concentration in Condominium Projects
FHA will only insure up to 50 percent of the total number of units in an approved condominium project.
Commercial/Nonresidential Space Limits
FHA will require that the commercial/non-residential space within an approved condominium project not exceed 35 percent of the project's total floor area."

The proposed rule as amended would provide more appropriate guidance on what constitutes unlawful disparate impact to better reflect the Supreme Court's 2015 ruling in Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs v. Inclusive Communities Project, Inc. Read HUD's proposed rule (www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/08/19/2019-17542/huds-implementation-of-the-fair-housing-acts-disparate-impact-standard).
""There is a lack of affordable housing in America today,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""This proposed rule is intended to increase legal clarity and promote the production and availability of housing in all areas while making sure every person is treated fairly under the law. As we have shown time and again, we will challenge any practice that discriminates against people that the law protects. At the end of the day, this rule not only increases Americans' access to fair and affordable housing, but also permits businesses and local governments to make valid policy choices.""
The HUD proposed disparate impact rule provides a framework for establishing legal liability for facially neutral practices that have unintended discriminatory effects on classes of persons protected under the Fair Housing Act. The rule has no impact on determinations of intentional discrimination. In its 2015 decision, the Supreme Court upheld the use of a 'disparate impact' theory to establish liability under the Fair Housing Act for business policies and local ordinances even if the policy or ordinance is neutral - in intent and application - if it disproportionately affects a protected class without a legally sufficient justification."

WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Census Bureau jointly announced the following new residential construction statistics for July 2019.

Building Permits
Privately owned housing units authorized by building permits in July were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,336,000. This is 8.4 percent (±1.1 percent) above the revised June rate of 1,232,000 and is 1.5 percent (±1.4 percent) above the July 2018 rate of 1,316,000. Single-family authorizations in July were at a rate of 838,000; this is 1.8 percent (±1.4 percent)* above the revised June figure of 823,000. Authorizations of units in buildings with five units or more were at a rate of 453,000 in July.
Housing Starts
Privately owned housing starts in July were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,191,000. This is 4.0 percent (±8.0 percent)* below the revised June estimate of 1,241,000, but is 0.6 percent (±8.2 percent)* above the July 2018 rate of 1,184,000. Single-family housing starts in July were at a rate of 876,000; this is 1.3 percent (±11.8 percent)* above the revised June figure of 865,000. The July rate for units in buildings with five units or more was 303,000.
Housing Completions
Privately-owned housing completions in July were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,250,000. This is 7.2 percent (±11.4 percent)* above the revised June estimate of 1,166,000 and is 6.3 percent (±12.0 percent)* above the July 2018 rate of 1,176,000. Single-family housing completions in July were at a rate of 918,000; this is 4.3 percent (±10.8 percent)* above the revised June rate of 880,000. The July rate for units in buildings with five units or more was 321,000.

EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take three months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, six months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2 percent) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percentage change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percentage changes are 90 percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percentage changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised 3 percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at the Census Bureau's website (www.census.gov/construction/nrc/how_the_data_are_collected/index.html).
* The 90 percent confidence interval includes zero. In such cases, there is insufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero."
08/20/2019:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2019/pr19-124.cfm,HUD Awards $28 Million to Clean Up Lead Hazards in Public Housing,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today awarded $27.8 million to 38 Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) in 25 states to identify and reduce lead-based paint hazards in thousands of older public housing units. Provided through HUD's Public Housing Capital Fund, these grants will be targeted to approximately 2,800 public housing units, most of which are currently occupied by families with young children (see below).
""We have no higher calling than to make certain the public housing that taxpayers support is healthy for our vulnerable families to live in,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""As a doctor who treated many young children, I witnessed the close connection between health and housing. Today we make another critical investment in the futures of young children growing up in public housing.""
Although lead-based paint was banned for residential use in 1978, HUD estimates that about 24 million older homes still have significant lead-based paint hazards today. However, homes receiving rental assistance, including public housing, tend to have a lower prevalence of lead-based paint hazards compared to private housing. While most public housing has already undergone abatement, there are still some properties where lead-based paint remains and hazards have redeveloped.
Lead-contaminated dust is the primary cause of lead exposure and can lead to a variety of health problems in young children, including reduced IQ, learning disabilities, developmental delays, reduced height, and impaired hearing. At higher levels, lead can damage a child's kidneys and central nervous system and can even be deadly.
In addition to the funding announced today, HUD will award a record $330 million later this year to clean up lead-based paint and other housing-related health and safety hazards in privately owned low-income housing. Click here (www.youtube.com/watch?v=oN1zWgZ7eUs&feature=youtu.be) or on this video to view Secretary Carson discuss the importance of HUD's efforts to protect young children from lead.
In 2017, HUD published a new rule lowering the Department's threshold of lead in the child's blood to match the more protective guidance of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This important change to HUD's Lead Safe Housing Rule allows for a faster response if a young child is exposed to lead-based paint hazards in their HUD-assisted homes.
HUD has a long history of working to ensure lead-safe housing, which fits into the broader federal response to address lead hazards found in paint, dust and soil, and other sources like water and consumer goods. For 25 years, HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes has worked to improve methods to identify and address home-related health and safety hazards, including those from lead. Since 1993, HUD has awarded more than $2 billion in grants to communities for identification and control of lead-based paint hazards in over 200,000 low-income privately owned housing units. In addition, HUD supports research on best practices for identifying and controlling lead-based paint hazards and conducts an outreach program to get out the message."
08/21/2019:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2019/pr19-125.cfm,HUD Takes a Major Step to Improve Health and Safety Inspections,"WASHINGTON - Today the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced another step to overhaul the Department's 20-year-old inspection process to ensure taxpayer-supported housing is healthy and safe. HUD is launching a new demonstration to test innovative new approaches for making certain thousands of public housing agencies (PHAs) and private owners provide housing that is ""decent, safe and sanitary."" Read HUD's Notice of Demonstration to Assess the National Standards for the Physical Inspection of Real Estate (NSPIRE) and Associated Protocols (www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/08/21/2019-17910/notice-of-demonstration-to-assess-the-national-standards-for-the-physical-inspection-of-real-estate).
""The inspection process we've relied upon for so many years often doesn't reflect the actual housing conditions being endured by the families we support,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""Today, we take another important step in our top-to-bottom review of this inspection system so that we can be sure that the housing taxpayers subsidize is healthy and safe for the millions of families we serve.""
HUD's notice is part of a wholesale reexamination of the inspection process used by Department's Real Estate Assessment Center (REAC). REAC is responsible for inspecting properties owned and operated by approximately 3,700 local public housing authorities and approximately 23,000 privately owned apartment buildings nationwide. Combined, approximately 96 percent of these properties pass their inspections.
Still, it has been HUD's observation that many public housing authorities and private owners of HUD-subsidized housing have grown accustomed to REAC's 20-year-old inspection regime and, in some cases, invest more resources in passing minimal inspection requirements rather than satisfying their obligation to provide quality housing.
Earlier this year, HUD dramatically reduced the advance notice it provides to PHAs and private owners of HUD-subsidized properties before their housing is inspected to ensure it is decent, safe and healthy on a year-round basis. HUD now provides PHAs and private owners of HUD-assisted housing just 14 calendar days' notice before an inspection, a dramatic reduction from the former notice which could frequently extend up to four months.
Over the past several months, HUD also hosted a series of listening sessions to gather input from the public and HUD stakeholders about the NSPIRE Model and the Demonstration being announced today to test innovative new approaches to inspecting HUD-assisted properties. The NSPIRE Model Demonstration will assess all aspects of REAC's physical inspection process, including the evaluation of physical inspection data and a new scoring model. The goal is to design a new simplified inspection system that more accurately reflects the physical conditions within housing units and to place a greater emphasis on health and safety for HUD residents, especially around lead-based paint hazards and mold.
Under the NSPIRE Model Demonstration, HUD will inspect approximately 4,500 properties from a pool of nationwide volunteers who are willing to adopt the new physical inspection standards. Actual NSPIRE Model Demonstration inspections will start after the 60-day public comment period associated with the notice is completed."

HUD's Capital Fund Emergency Safety and Security Program supports public housing authorities as they address the safety of public housing residents. These grants may be used to install, repair, or replace capital needs items including security systems/surveillance cameras, fencing, lighting systems, emergency alarm systems, window bars, deadbolt locks and doors.
""Every family deserves to feel safe in their home,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""HUD is determined to ensure the well-being of public housing residents and these grants give communities the tools they need to make that happen.""

08/23/2019:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2019/pr19-127.cfm,"HUD Approves Agreement between Housing Rights Center and Avalonbay Communities, Inc., Resolving Allegations of Race Discrimination","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced it has approved a Conciliation Agreement between Housing Rights Center (HRC), a fair housing advocacy organization in Los Angeles, and Arlington, VA-based AvalonBay Communities, Inc., resolving allegations that the real estate investment trust employed rental practices that discriminated against applicants based on their race. Read the agreement.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to discriminate against applicants for housing because of their race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, or disability, including by providing different and false information about terms, conditions and availability of rental properties.
""Denying a rental application because of someone's race not only robs them of a place to call home, it is also unlawful,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Hopefully today's settlement will convince other housing providers of the importance of meeting their obligation to comply with the nation's fair housing laws.""
The case came to HUD's attention when HRC filed a complaint alleging that AvalonBay, which operates numerous properties in the Los Angeles area, repeatedly provided more information about available units to white HRC fair housing testers who posed as prospective tenants than to black HRC testers. AvalonBay denies the allegations of racial discrimination but agreed to conciliate the case.
Under the Conciliation Agreement, AvalonBay will pay Housing Rights Center $20,000. In addition, its management and leasing staff who work with tenants at the subject property will attend fair housing training. AvalonBay also agreed to comply with all provisions of the Fair Housing Act in the future.
Persons who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY)."

Read HUD's notice (https://files.hudexchange.info/resources/documents/FR-6109-N-02-CDBG-Mitigation-Notice.pdf).
CDBG-Mitigation funds represent a unique and significant opportunity for grantees to use this assistance in areas impacted by recent disasters to carry out long-term strategic and high-impact activities to mitigate disaster risks and reduce future losses. While it is impossible to eliminate all risks, these funds will enable grantees to mitigate against disaster risks, while at the same time allowing grantees the opportunity to transform State and local planning.
Through this notice, HUD seeks to:
Support data-informed investments in high-impact projects that will reduce risks attributable to natural disasters, with particular focus on repetitive loss of property and critical infrastructure; Build the capacity of States and local governments to comprehensively analyze disaster risks and to update hazard mitigation plans through the use of data and meaningful community engagement; Support the adoption of policies that reflect local and regional priorities that will have long-lasting effects on community risk reduction, to include the risk reduction to community lifelines such as Safety and Security, Communications, Food, Water, Sheltering, Transportation, Health and Medical, Hazardous Material (management) and Energy (Power & fuel), and future disaster costs; and Maximize the impact of available funds by encouraging leverage, private-public partnerships, and coordination with other Federal programs.

08/29/2019:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2019/pr19-130.cfm,HUD Charges Colorado Landlords with Discriminating Against Families with Children,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced that it is charging the owners and manager of a condominium complex in Gunnison, CO, with refusing to rent to persons under 35 years of age in violation of the Fair Housing Act, which prohibits discrimination based on familial status. The charge further alleges that the condominium management team refused to rent a unit to a fair housing tester who claimed to have a four-year-old child. Read HUD's charge.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to deny or limit housing because a family has children under the age of 18 or to make statements that discriminate against families with children.
""It's difficult enough for families to find suitable housing without having their options further limited because they have children,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Today's action reinforces HUD's commitment to taking appropriate action against housing providers that engage in unlawful practices.""
The case came to HUD's attention when Denver Metro Fair Housing Center, a HUD Fair Housing Initiatives Program agency, filed a complaint alleging that the owners of the condominium complex discriminated against families with children when they posted ads in a local newspaper. HUD's charge alleges that the ads described the complex as a ""private, restricted adult … community"" where renters must be 35 years or older. The charge further alleges that the condominium management team refused to rent a unit to a fair housing tester who claimed to have a four-year-old child.
""The Fair Housing Act has prohibited 'adult-only' housing since 1989. HUD will enforce the law against housing providers that unlawfully keep out families with children,"" said Paul Compton, HUD's General Counsel.
The charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party elects for the case to be heard in federal court. If the administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he or she may award damages to the complainant for its losses as a result of the discrimination. The judge may also order other injunctive or equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties to vindicate the public interest.
Persons who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY)."

HUD's Youth Homelessness Demonstration Program (YHDP) (https://files.hudexchange.info/resources/documents/YHDP-Fact-Sheet.pdf) will help these communities to build local systems and will support a wide range of housing programs including rapid rehousing, permanent supportive housing, transitional housing, and host homes. This year's funding level is significantly higher than the $43 million awarded last year.
""Homelessness is no way to start out in life for young people reaching adulthood,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""Today we make another critical investment in the futures of our youth, sparing them a life on the streets or in our shelters and placing them on a path to self-sufficiency.""
""The solutions to youth homelessness that are being built and tested through HUD's YHDP program represent community collaboration at its best,"" said Matthew Doherty, Executive Director of the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness. ""We are confident that these communities, and their Youth Action Boards, will help lead us along the path to end youth homelessness in our country.""
HUD developed YHDP with youth in mind, relying upon the recommendations provided directly from young people who had experienced homelessness. To ensure that the program meets the needs of young people, HUD incorporated many of the same young people who provided recommendations on the program's design in the application review process. Their assessment helped HUD ensure that grant applicants understood the needs and preferences of the young people they will serve. See how HUD helps homeless youth by watching our #HumansOfHUD profile of Taisacan Hall.
HUD also worked closely with its federal partners to help develop the program and review applications, including the Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Department of Education (ED), and the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH).
Recipients will use this funding to support a variety of housing options for young people under the age of 25 and who are experiencing homelessness. YHDP will also support youth-focused performance measurement and coordinated entry systems to quickly connect young people with other services and systems of care.
Over the next several months, the communities selected for these grants will work with their 'youth action boards,' child welfare agencies, and other community partners to create a comprehensive community plan to end youth homelessness. They will also participate in a program evaluation to inform the federal effort to prevent and end youth homelessness going forward and will serve as leaders in the nation on the work to end homelessness among young people.

08/29/2019:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2019/pr19-132.cfm,FHA Strengthens Mortgage Relief Options to Help Homeowners Impacted by Major Disasters,"WASHINGTON - When disasters strike, homeowners can fall behind in their mortgage payments as they struggle to recover from a major disaster. To help homeowners impacted by major disasters, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) today announced it is expanding its foreclosure prevention options to allow borrowers in Presidentially Declared Major Disaster Areas (PDMDAs) with delinquent FHA-insured mortgages to bring their mortgages current without increasing their interest rates or principal and interest payments.
Read FHA's Mortgagee Letter to mortgage servicers.
""Today we take another important step to help families with FHA-insured mortgages recover from the impact of a major disaster and to avoid foreclosure,"" said Federal Housing Commissioner Brian Montgomery. ""The changes we're making to our policy will help individuals and families with an FHA-insured mortgage to cure their delinquencies while protecting our insurance fund in the process.""
Last year, FHA introduced the Disaster Standalone Partial Claim option to help struggling homeowners impacted by 2017 natural disasters to resume their pre-disaster mortgage payments without payment increases. Effectively immediately, FHA's ""Disaster Standalone Partial Claim"" will now be a standard mortgage relief option available for all victims of natural disasters in all PDMDAs. FHA's Disaster Standalone Partial Claim option provides these homeowners with an opportunity to be evaluated for a permanent loss mitigation solution. This option is a solution for many homeowners seeking to cure arrearages and resume making payments without modifying their loan and re-amortizing the loan term.
The Disaster Standalone Partial Claim option covers missed mortgage payments up to 30 percent of Unpaid Principal Balance (UPB) through an interest-free subordinate lien on the mortgage, payable only when the borrower sells the home or refinances their mortgage. In addition, this option requires no trial period or balloon payment. FHA's Disaster Standalone Partial Claim also streamlines income documentation and other requirements to expedite relief to homeowners struggling to pay their mortgage while recovering from disasters.
Homeowners with an FHA-insured mortgage may qualify for the updated Disaster Standalone Partial Claim if they meet the following conditions:

09/05/2019:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2019/pr19-134.cfm,HUD Expands Housing Preservation Program to Include Senior Housing,"WASHINGTON - In an effort to preserve and improve critically needed affordable housing for low-income seniors, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced a significant expansion of its Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) to facilitate capital investment in senior housing developments assisted through HUD's Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly Project Rental Assistance Contracts (PRAC). Read HUD's notice.
Expanding RAD to include Section 202 PRAC units will now allow nonprofit housing developers to access capital investment to revitalize their aging properties and to ensure sustainable affordability for their very low-income elderly residents. There are approximately 120,000 units across 2,800 properties that will now become eligible to participate in RAD.
""This is exciting news for those who provide affordable housing for senior citizens who need a stable home to age-in-place,"" Secretary Ben Carson said. ""By expanding RAD's reach into this vital part of our affordable housing stock, we can prioritize and mobilize capital investment to tackle the projected backlog of repairs in these properties and preserve more affordable housing for those who need it most.""
Brian Montgomery, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Housing and Federal Housing Commissioner added, ""Using RAD to preserve affordable rental housing for very low-income seniors is a natural next step in addressing the need for safe and affordable housing for the nation's most vulnerable populations.""
The conversion of 202 PRACs builds off the success of the RAD program and the lessons learned from the thousands of conversions to date. RAD has preserved nearly 150,000 units of affordable housing across the country to date. Other changes to RAD in today's notice include:
Extending and expands on the stringent resident rights protections built into RAD; Allowing a limited contract rent increase for certain converting public housing properties located in Opportunity Zones to help owners access capital for high-impact new construction and substantial rehabilitation investments; and Prioritizing conversion of public housing properties located in Opportunity Zones if there is a waiting list for the limited RAD participation authority.
• Extending and expands on the stringent resident rights protections built into RAD;
• Allowing a limited contract rent increase for certain converting public housing properties located in Opportunity Zones to help owners access capital for high-impact new construction and substantial rehabilitation investments; and
• Prioritizing conversion of public housing properties located in Opportunity Zones if there is a waiting list for the limited RAD participation authority.
Under RAD, public housing authorities and other owners of affordable housing convert their developments to a project-based Section 8 platform. This conversion allows PHAs and these owners to identify creative ways to solve their capital needs through public-private partnerships and with no new federal funding. The new, long-term project-based Section 8 contracts fortify the sustainability and long-term affordability of these properties.
RAD has proven to be a powerful tool for PHAs to preserve affordable housing to serve more eligible households and to maximize the impact of existing commitment of federal resources."
09/05/2019:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2019/pr19-135.cfm,The Department of Housing and Urban Development Submits Housing Reform Plan to the President,"WASHINGTON - Today, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) presented President Donald Trump with a plan for reforming the Nation's housing finance system. Read HUD's housing finance reform plan.
On March 27, 2019, President Trump issued a Memorandum on Federal Housing Finance Reform, directing HUD and the Department of Treasury to craft the housing finance reform plans released today. HUD plays a critical role in the Nation's housing finance system, primarily through the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). FHA currently insures 8.1 million single-family forward mortgages, nearly 500,000 reverse mortgages, and 15,500 multifamily and healthcare properties. In addition, the Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae) guarantees more than $2 trillion in mortgage-backed securities.
""As a direct result of the Trump Administration's pro-growth policies, unemployment is at 50-year low and American families are earning higher incomes and enjoying more opportunities than seemed possible just a few years ago,"" said Secretary Ben Carson. ""There is still one piece of unfinished business from the financial crisis: housing finance reform. These changes to our housing finance system will help more American families achieve their dream of owning a home.""
The reform plan presented today ensures FHA and Ginnie Mae can continue to serve their important missions effectively, responsibly, and sustainably for many years to come. HUD's reform plan accomplishes four objectives:
• Refocuses FHA to its core mission;
• Protects American taxpayers;
• Provides FHA and Ginnie Mae the tools to appropriately manage risk; and
• Provides liquidity to the housing finance system.
""FHA and Ginnie Mae should focus on helping families and individuals in their respective programs become sustainable homeowners while minimizing risk to the taxpayer to the greatest extent possible,"" said Brian Montgomery, FHA Commissioner and Assistant Secretary of Housing.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin also presented President Trump with a complementary housing finance reform plan today. Read Treasury's housing finance reform plan (https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm769)."
09/06/2019:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2019/pr19-133.cfm,HUD Reaches Voluntary Compliance and Conciliation Agreement with Los Angeles Housing Authority Settling Discrimination Claim,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced today that it has entered into a Conciliation/Voluntary Compliance Agreement with the Housing Authority of Los Angeles (HACLA), settling claims that it discriminated against a resident because of her sex and disabilities. Read the agreement.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to discriminate in housing because of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, disability, or familial status. This includes refusing to provide reasonable accommodations to persons with disabilities. In addition, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance. Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in all programs, services, and activities of local governments.
""It is incumbent upon housing providers, especially those receiving federal funding, to treat all residents fairly,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""We are pleased that the Housing Authority of Los Angeles has agreed that, going forward, it will incorporate rental policies and practices that are consistent with the nation's fair housing laws.""
The case came to HUD's attention when a resident of the Housing Authority of Los Angeles filed a complaint alleging that HACLA discriminated against her on the basis of sex and disability. Specifically, the resident alleged that she asked to be transferred to another building to accommodate her disability, but the housing authority denied her request. The resident further alleged that for months she asked to be transferred, citing the need for an accommodation because of her disability. She also requested an emergency transfer under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) as a tenant in a covered housing program under that Act. After several more months, HACLA provided the resident with four transfer options, which she rejected because she believed that the alternative units were similarly unsafe and would not provide her with an accommodation for her disability. HACLA denies the claims but agreed to settle the resident's complaint.
Under the terms of this agreement, HACLA will pay the resident $35,000 and transfer her to another building. HACLA will also pay $15,000 to the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles, which assisted the resident with filing her complaint, to cover attorneys' fees. In addition, certain HACLA employees will undergo training pertaining to fair housing, reasonable accommodations, and VAWA. HACLA will also amend its VAWA emergency transfer plan and reasonable accommodation procedures.
Persons who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY)."
09/11/2019:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2019/pr19-136.cfm,HUD Order Settles Claims of Discrimination Against Families with Children,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced the owners and managers of a single-family rental home in Nampa, Idaho, will pay $15,000 pursuant to a Consent Order resolving allegations that they violated the Fair Housing Act by refusing to rent the large home to a married couple because they have more than four children.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to deny or limit housing because a family has children under the age of 18, make statements that discriminate against families with children, and impose different rules, restrictions or policies on them.
""Persons attempting to provide a home for their family should not have their housing options limited because they have children,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Today's action will hopefully serve as a reminder to all housing providers of the importance of meeting their obligations to comply with the requirements of the Fair Housing Act.""
""This Consent Order is another example of the important role HUD plays in enforcing the Fair Housing Act,"" said HUD General Counsel Paul Compton. ""Not only have we obtained relief for the family that was denied housing, but we have also educated housing providers about their responsibilities under the law.""
The Consent Order resolves a charge that HUD filed in May 2019, alleging that the homeowners discriminated against a family attempting to lease their 2,600 square foot, four-bedroom rental home because they have seven minor children. Specifically, HUD's charge alleges when the couple met with the property manager about renting the home, he told them that the owners had set a limit of four children for the home. The charge also alleges a policy restricting the number of children was written in the rental contract.
Under the Consent Order, the owners will pay $15,000 to the couple and their seven children. The owners also agreed to retain the services of a professional property management company to manage their rental properties, and they attended fair housing training following the filing of the couple's initial complaint.
Persons who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (Voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to www.hud.gov/fairhousing, or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, which can be accessed through Apple devices, such as the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch."

Read HUD's charge.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to discriminate against families with children under the age of eighteen. Housing may exclude children only if it meets the Fair Housing Act's exemption for housing for older persons.
""Landlords and property owners don't have the right to deny housing to families simply because they have children,"" said Anna Maria Farias, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will continue to take appropriate action when individuals in the position to control access to housing fail to meet their responsibility to comply with the Fair Housing Act.""
""The Fair Housing Act generally prohibits landlords from limiting housing to families with a certain number of children. HUD is committed to enforcing the Act to ensure that families with children are given equal housing opportunities,"" said Paul Compton, HUD's General Counsel.
This case came to HUD's attention when Savannah-Chatham County Fair Housing Council and the mother of two minor children filed complaints alleging that Michael N. and Fonda W. Parker employed a policy limiting the number of children that could reside in their apartments. HUD's charge alleges that the Parkers' business voicemail recording announced the policy to persons who phoned looking for housing. The policy allows only one child in a two-bedroom unit and two children in a three-bedroom unit.
The charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party elects for the case to be heard in federal court. If the administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he or she may award damages to the complainants for their loss as a result of the discrimination. The judge may also order other injunctive or equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties to vindicate the public interest."

Named as respondents by HUD's charge are Toll Brothers, Inc.; Toll Land XIII Limited Partner; Lendlease (US) Construction LMB, Inc; Greenberg Farrow Architecture, Inc.; and 51 North 8th Street LP. Read HUD's charge.
The Fair Housing Act requires that multifamily housing built after March 1991 contain accessible features for persons with disabilities. This includes accessible common areas, bathrooms and kitchens, as well as wider doors and environmental controls that can be reached by residents who use wheelchairs. The failure to include these features is unlawful and makes the property difficult or impossible to use by people with disabilities.
""When developers and builders fail to construct housing that complies with the Fair Housing Act, they not only violate the law, they make it more difficult for persons with disabilities to obtain the accessible housing they need,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Today's action reflects HUD's ongoing commitment to taking action when housing providers fall short of meeting their legal obligations.""
""The Fair Housing Act requires that housing built since 1991 contain basic features of accessibility. These features are less expensive to provide at the time of construction than after the building has been completed,"" said Paul Compton, HUD's General Counsel. ""HUD will continue to take action to bring inaccessible housing into compliance with the law.""
The case began when HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity initiated a complaint after HUD staff found that the condominium complex failed to meet the design and construction requirements mandated by the Fair Housing Act. According to the charge, North8 Condominium lacks accessible routes and entrances into and through the common areas and units accessible kitchens and accessible bathrooms.
The charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party elects for the case to be heard in federal court. If the administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages to individuals injured by the inaccessible housing. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, including retrofitting of the property, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties in order to vindicate the public interest.

EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take three months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, six months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2 percent) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percentage change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percentage changes are 90 percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percentage changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised 3 percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at the Census Bureau's website (www.census.gov/construction/nrc/how_the_data_are_collected/index.html).
* The 90 percent confidence interval includes zero. In such cases, there is insufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero."

HUD is awarding Choice Neighborhood Planning grants to the following communities:
Read local summaries of the grants announced today.
HUD's Choice Neighborhoods program promotes a comprehensive approach to transforming neighborhoods struggling to address the interconnected challenges of distressed housing, inadequate schools, poor health, high crime, and historic disinvestment. Choice Neighborhoods is focused on three core goals:
Housing: Replace distressed public and assisted housing with high-quality mixed-income housing that is well-managed and responsive to the needs of the surrounding neighborhood. People: Improve outcomes of households living in the target housing related to employment and income, health, and children's education; and Neighborhood: Create the conditions necessary for public and private reinvestment in distressed neighborhoods to offer the kinds of amenities and assets, including safety, good schools, and commercial activity, that are important to families' choices about their community.
• Housing: Replace distressed public and assisted housing with high-quality mixed-income housing that is well-managed and responsive to the needs of the surrounding neighborhood.
• People: Improve outcomes of households living in the target housing related to employment and income, health, and children's education; and
• Neighborhood: Create the conditions necessary for public and private reinvestment in distressed neighborhoods to offer the kinds of amenities and assets, including safety, good schools, and commercial activity, that are important to families' choices about their community.
Through Choice Neighborhoods Planning Grants, local governments, housing authorities, residents, nonprofits, tribal authorities, private developers, school districts, police departments, and other civic organizations create a common vision and develop effective strategies to revitalize their neighborhood. The resulting Transformation Plan lays the foundation for revitalizing the distressed public and/or assisted housing units, transforming the surrounding neighborhood, and promoting opportunities for families.
In addition, grantees may use a portion of these funds for “Action Activities” to build momentum and attract additional investment. Eligible uses of these funds include recycling vacant property into community gardens, pocket parks, or farmers markets; beautification, place-making and community arts projects; homeowner and business façade improvement programs; neighborhood broadband or wi-fi; fresh food initiatives; and gap financing for economic development projects."

The City of Batesville in Arkansas will receive a $500,000 grant to redevelop The Adler Building and the City of Thomas in Oklahoma will receive $ 500,000 to rehabilitate commercial space into residential units in the city's commercial district. The grants are funded through HUD's HOPE VI Main Street Program.
The City of Batesville, Arkansas will redevelop ""The Adler Building,"" located on West Main Street. Built in 1881, this is one of the oldest surviving buildings in Arkansas' oldest surviving town. The first floor of the building originally served as a general store, and the second floor was an Opera Hall, used for socializing and community events. This grant will be used to renovate the building to include affordable residential units and two commercial units. Two of the units will be set aside for very low income families (50 percent or below of Area Median Income).
Batesville, Arkansas is also located within a federal Opportunity Zone, a designation intended to stimulate long-term private investment in low-income urban and rural communities by allowing investors to realize significant federal tax benefits through investing capital gains in Qualified Opportunity Funds.
The City of Thomas, Oklahoma will use the funding to rehabilitate six residential units above six historic buildings in the City's core commercial district. These units were previously residential but are no longer because they have fallen into disrepair. The City of Thomas currently only has a total of 11 affordable housing units, and the City is eager to increase this number.
""Main Street grants not only provide affordable housing, but they also increase economic opportunities, including in Opportunity Zones,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""HUD is proud to be a partner to rebuild and transform communities like Thomas and Batesville into vibrant and sustainable neighborhoods.""
HUD's Main Street program seeks to rejuvenate older, downtown business districts while retaining the area's traditional and historic character by providing grants to smaller communities for the development of affordable housing. Such communities must have an ongoing Main Street revitalization effort. Under Main Street, obsolete commercial offices or buildings can be reconfigured into rent producing affordable housing.
Background on Opportunity Zones
President Trump signed the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, creating Opportunity Zones to stimulate long-term investments in low-income communities. Opportunity Zones offer capital gains tax relief to those who invest in these distressed areas. This initiative is anticipated to spur $100 billion in private capital investment in Opportunity Zones. Incentivizing investment in low-income communities fosters economic revitalization, job creation, and promotes sustainable economic growth across the nation, especially in communities HUD serves. Read more about Opportunity Zones.
Opportunity Zones are a powerful vehicle for bringing economic growth and job creation to the American communities that need it the most. On average, the median family income in an Opportunity Zone is 37 percent below its respective state median. Overall, more than 8,700 communities in all 50 States, Washington D.C., and five U.S. territories have been designated as Opportunity Zones. Nearly 35 million Americans live in communities designated as Opportunity Zones."

""The housing assistance and supportive services announced today will allow Tribes across the country to continue their important work of ensuring Native American Veterans have a safe place to call home.""
In 2015, Congress authorized funding for a demonstration program in order to expand the HUD-VASH program into Indian Country. HUD was directed to coordinate with Tribes, TDHEs, and other appropriate tribal organizations on the design of this program, and to ensure the effective delivery of housing assistance and supportive services to eligible Native American Veterans. Since its inception, the demonstration program has awarded a total of $12.6 million.

This funding will build on the $74 million HUD awarded earlier this year to continue helping public housing residents participating in the Housing Choice Voucher Program and/or reside in public housing to increase their earned income and reduce their dependency on public assistance and rental subsidies. To expand the impact of the Family Self Sufficiency program, this is the first time since 2012 that new public housing authorities have been awarded funding. See chart below.
HUD Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, Hunter Kurtz made the announcement today at the Clinton County Housing Authority in Pennsylvania, one of the grantees.
""Helping HUD-assisted families reach their goals is a part of our core mission here at HUD,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""We are proud to work with our local partners to help families in their communities become self-sufficient by connecting them to educational training, job opportunities, child-care and other resources.""
HUD Assistant Secretary Hunter Kurtz added: ""HUD is committed to connecting public housing residents to opportunities. By linking people to computer access, job training, financial literacy and other tools, these grants will give residents the skills they need to compete and succeed.""
These grants renew HUD's support of public housing authorities through the Department's Family Self-Sufficiency (FSS) program. HUD's FSS program helps local public housing authorities hire service coordinators who work directly with residents to connect them with programs and services that already exist in the local community. The FSS program encourages innovative strategies that link housing assistance with a broad spectrum of services that will enable participating families to find jobs, increase earned income, reduce or eliminate the need for rental and/or welfare assistance, and make progress toward achieving economic independence and housing self-sufficiency.
FSS participants sign a five-year contract that requires the head of the household to obtain employment and that no member of the household will receive certain types of public assistance at the end of the five-year term. These families have an interest-bearing escrow account established for them. The amount credited to the family's escrow account is based on increases in the family's earned income during the term of the FSS contract. If the family successfully completes its FSS contract, the family receives the escrow funds that it can use for any purpose, including debt reduction to improve credit scores, educational expenses, or a down payment on a home.
The average household income of FSS participants nearly tripled during their time in the program, from $10,000 at the time of entry to more than $27,000 upon program completion."

""This can be a win-win for residents living in these neighborhoods—more health care facilities and hospitals closer to home and greater employment opportunities for those in the health care industry,"" said Secretary Carson.
FHA Commissioner Brian Montgomery added, ""We're providing a number of incentives to stimulate more building and rehabilitation of hospitals, nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and board and care facilities in Opportunity Zones across the country. It's our hope these incentives will encourage significant levels of long-term investment in low-income communities.""
FHA's Section 242 Program insures mortgages for acute care hospital facilities ranging from large teaching institutions to small rural critical access hospitals. Similarly, FHA's Section 232 Program provides mortgage insurance on loans that help finance nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and board and care facilities. These programs may be used to finance the purchase, refinance, new construction, or substantial rehabilitation of a project. A combination of these uses is acceptable - e.g. refinance of a nursing home coupled with new construction of an assisted living facility.
Effective immediately, FHA is giving priority to Section 232 applications it receives for facilities located in qualified Opportunity Zones. Most notably, FHA will provide expedited underwriting for Section 232 applications. FHA is. also reducing application/exam fees for all Section 242 and Section 232 transactions for facilities in Opportunity Zones. Read FHA's notice.
Background
President Trump signed the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, creating Opportunity Zones to stimulate long-term investment in low-income communities. Opportunity Zones offer capital gains tax relief to those who invest in these distressed areas. This initiative is anticipated to spur $100 billion in private capital investment in Opportunity Zones. Incentivizing investment in low-income communities fosters economic revitalization, job creation, and promotes sustainable economic vitality across the nation. Read more about Opportunity Zones (www.irs.gov/newsroom/tax-reform-creates-opportunity-zone-tax-incentive).
On average, the median family income in an Opportunity Zone is 37 percent below its respective state median. Overall, more than 8,700 communities in all 50 States, Washington D.C., and five U.S. territories have been designated as Opportunity Zones. Nearly 35 million Americans live in communities designated as Opportunity Zones."

Read HUD's charge.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to discriminate against families with children under the age of eighteen. Housing may exclude children only if it meets the Fair Housing Act's exemption for housing for older persons.
""Denying a family the opportunity to obtain housing because they have children is akin to slamming a door in their face,"" said Anna Maria Farias, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""This charge reflects HUD's ongoing commitment to taking appropriate action whenever landlords and property owners fail to meet their obligations under fair housing laws.""
According to HUD's charge, the owner of a mixed-use property, which contains two apartments, allegedly refused to rent a one-bedroom unit to an applicant because he has a son who would stay with him three times a week. HUD's charge further alleged that the owner stated that he did not want any children living at the property, citing parking concerns.
""The Fair Housing Act protects families with children from unlawful discrimination when seeking access to housing,"" said Paul Compton, HUD's General Counsel. ""HUD will continue to bring actions to ensure that landlords comply with their obligations under the law.""
The charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party elects for the case to be heard in federal court. If the judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he or she may award damages to the complainants for their loss as a result of the discrimination. The judge may also order other injunctive or equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties to vindicate the public interest."
09/30/2019:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2019/pr19-145.cfm,HUD Awards Record $319 Million to Protect Families from Lead and Other Home Health Hazards,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today awarded more than $314 million to 77 state and local government agencies, a record investment to protect children and families from lead-based paint and home health hazards. In addition, HUD is awarding more than $5 million to identify and address home health and safety hazards in six tribal communities.
These grants are provided through HUD's Lead Based Paint Hazard Reduction Program and Healthy Homes Production Grant Program for Tribal Housing to identify and clean up dangerous lead in low-income housing. Many of the grantees announced today will work to clean up lead hazards in Opportunity Zones.
""We are committed to improving the lives of all families, especially children, by creating safer and healthier homes,"" said Secretary Ben Carson. ""One of HUD's priorities is protecting families from lead-based paint and other health hazards. These grants will help states, tribes, and local communities do precisely that.""
The Lead Based Paint Hazard Reduction Program grants include $30 million in HUD's Healthy Homes Supplemental funding to help communities address housing-related health and safety hazards, in addition to lead-based paint hazards. Seven local communities were awarded grants to help their 'High Impact Neighborhood' where they will conduct lead hazard control and healthy homes work intensively in a targeted neighborhood impacted by poor housing conditions. HUD's new tribal grants fill critical needs in communities where limited resources exist to address substandard housing that threatens the health of the most vulnerable tribal residents.
Combined, these investments will protect families and children by targeting health hazards in more than 14,700 low-income homes with significant lead and health hazards for which other resources are not available to address these needs.
""HUD understands the close connection between health and housing,"" said Matthew Ammon, Director of HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes. ""This year, HUD is awarding a record number of awards to jurisdictions to directly support their efforts to identify and clean up housing-based health hazards like lead and mold.""
HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes promotes local efforts to eliminate dangerous lead paint and other housing-related health hazards from lower income homes; stimulates private sector investment in lead hazard control; supports cutting-edge research on methods for assessing and controlling housing-related health and safety hazards; and educates the public about the dangers of hazards in the home. Read a complete project-by-project summary of the programs awarded grants today.

10/04/2019:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2019/pr19-149.cfm,HUD Charges Montana Housing Providers with Discriminating Against a Family with Children,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is charging housing providers in Billings, Montana, with violating the Fair Housing Act by refusing to rent to and making discriminatory statements about a family with children. Read HUD's charge.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to discriminate against families with children under the age of eighteen. Housing may exclude children only if it meets the Fair Housing Act's exemption for housing for older persons. It is also unlawful to make statements indicating a preference, limitation or discrimination because of familial status.
""Owners of rental properties and their agents don't have the right to discriminate against families who have children just because they have children,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Today's action is another of many similar actions the Department has taken when housing providers fail to meet their obligations under the law.""
This case came to HUD's attention when a Montana mother filed a complaint alleging that Alice S. Klundt, Alice S. Klundt Living Trust, and Terry Pollert, who collectively own and manage a single-family rental home in Billings, refused to rent the home to her because she had two daughters under the age of eighteen. HUD's subsequent charge alleges that the housing providers denied the mother's application because of her minor children. The owner's agent allegedly made oral and written statements with respect to rental of the home that indicated a preference, limitation and discrimination based on the presence of the minor children. The owner eventually rented the home to a couple with no children.
""The Fair Housing Act requires that all Americans must have equal access to housing opportunities regardless of their familial status,"" said HUD General Counsel Paul Compton. ""HUD has a duty to enforce these rights, and this case demonstrates our continuing commitment to that duty.""
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party elects for the case to be heard in federal court. If the administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he or she may award damages to the complainant and her children for their loss as a result of the discrimination. The judge may also order other injunctive or equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties to vindicate the public interest."

The providers include PAMA Management Inc.; Nijjar Realty, Inc.; IE Rental Homes Inc.; Group IV Pomona Properties Ltd.; HORN TR; The Park Village Apts. 0332 PS; Cobra-28 Limited Partnership; Group II Azusa Properties Ltd.; Porto Management Inc.; and Sabraj Nijjar. Read the agreement.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from denying or limiting housing to persons with disabilities, or from refusing to make reasonable accommodations in policies or practices for persons with disabilities when the accommodations may be necessary to afford them an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling. This includes not allowing persons with disabilities to have assistance animals that perform work or tasks.
""Everyone should have the opportunity to fully enjoy the place they call home, including persons with disabilities,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD is pleased that the housing providers who are part of today's action have agreed to take steps to comply with the requirements of the Fair Housing Act.""
The case came to HUD's attention when Inland Fair Housing & Mediation Board (IFHMB), a HUD Fair Housing Initiatives Program agency, filed a complaint after it conducted tests of six properties owned or managed by the named housing providers showing that they denied persons with disabilities the right to keep assistance animals. IFHMB further alleged that employees of the providers failed to give residents with disabilities proper information regarding service animals. The providers denied the discrimination but agreed to settle the complaint.
Under the terms of the agreement, the housing providers will pay $15,000 to IFHMB. They will also have staff who interact with current and potential tenants attend fair housing training; modify their policies to include information on reasonable accommodations, modifications, and service animals; and ensure that staff who interact with current or potential tenants will have the ability to communicate in English and other languages.
Persons who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY)."

EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take three months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, six months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2 percent) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percentage change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percentage changes are 90 percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percentage changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised 3 percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at the Census Bureau's website (www.census.gov/construction/nrc/how_the_data_are_collected/index.html).
* The 90 percent confidence interval includes zero. In such cases, there is insufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero."

Children of low-income families living in older un-assisted housing face the greatest risk of lead poisoning. To help focus more public attention to lead poisoning prevention, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is joining other federal agencies and a cross section of public health and other advocacy organizations to promote National Lead Poisoning Prevention Week.
This year's theme centers on three essential messages: Get the Facts; Get Your Home Tested; and Get Your Child Tested. Learn more about National Lead Poisoning Prevention Week.
""While lead-based paint was banned for residential use nearly 40 years ago, we continue to witness young children being exposed to its toxic effects,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""As we work to end this disease once and for all, we need to continue to educate families living in homes built before 1978 to get their homes tested and protect their children from hazardous lead paint.""
This annual national public health education campaign comes after HUD recently awarded a record $319 million to state, local, and tribal communities to remove lead and other home health and safety hazards. In addition, HUD awarded $8.4 million to research organizations to study new, more cost-effective methods to address residential health hazards.
There are a variety of risks that result in lead exposure in the home:
Renovations of older homes that can expose children if done improperly Lead brought home from parents' workplaces Lead in drinking water from plumbing fixtures or supply pipes Lead-contaminated soil in children's play areas
• Renovations of older homes that can expose children if done improperly
• Lead brought home from parents' workplaces
• Lead in drinking water from plumbing fixtures or supply pipes
• Lead-contaminated soil in children's play areas
HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) joined together to develop the Partner Information Toolkit, which has many outreach resources, and suggestions for outreach techniques, all aimed at mobilizing community action for National Lead Poisoning Prevention Week and beyond."

Read HUD's evaluation (www.huduser.gov/portal/publications/RAD-Evaluation-Final-Report.html).
""This evaluation validates our long-held belief that RAD is working,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""Our aging public housing stock is at extreme risk of being lost and the capital needs of these properties are beyond what we can hope to get from Congress. RAD provides us the solution to preserve this critically needed housing so it remains permanently affordable for future generations.""
""The evidence is clear: RAD is improving the financial and physical condition of properties and tenants are satisfied with the improved quality of their housing post-conversion,"" added Seth Appleton, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research.
HUD's Evaluation was conducted to determine whether RAD is achieving its goal of preserving affordable housing by improving the physical condition of housing projects in the short-term and improving their financial footing for the long-term. Specifically, the Evaluation Found:
Increased Financial Leveraging - The report finds that RAD has been extremely successful at attracting capital to stabilize and improve public housing. From the program's inception in November 2011 through the October 2018, a total of 956 public housing projects with 103,268 units of public housing converted to Project-Based Section 8 (PBRA) or Project-based Vouchers (PBV). These projects raised a total of $12.6 billion of capital through a variety of sources, an average of $121,747 per unit. Improved Physical Condition - A sample of 17 properties were selected to be representative of RAD converting public housing projects. The RAD sample improved their physical condition, as measured by a reduction in their short-term and critical capital needs. On average, the sample projects had per-unit short-term needs of $12,981 before conversion and $4,608 afterwards-a 65 percent reduction. A comparison sample of non-RAD projects over the same period had, on average, $3,740 in short-term needs before conversion and $8,710 afterwards-a 133 percent increase. After conversion, the RAD projects studied have substantially lower critical needs (deficiencies concerning health, life, and safety such as accessibility deficiencies, structural defects, asbestos or lead-based paint). Stronger Financial Conditions - This study collected financial statements from a sample of 18 RAD projects (before and after their conversions) and 46 non-RAD projects. Financial indicators show that the liquidity and viability of RAD projects improved after conversion, while these indicators deteriorated for the non-RAD properties over the same period. Reliable Replacement Reserves - Replacement reserve accounts are intended to meet future capital needs. Adequate reserves are a key indicator of long-term viability. In a sample of 18 RAD projects, the median replacement reserve account balance was $240,000. Currently at 3.63 times the average required annual deposit into the replacement reserves, these figures indicate that the RAD properties are operating consistent with real estate asset management best practices, building reserves so that they will be able to address major future capital needs when they come due. Positive Tenant Survey Results - A survey of 298 residents at 18 RAD-converting properties showed general satisfaction with the results of RAD in terms of improving the quality of their housing. When asked about their satisfaction with their unit and development, more than 80 percent of tenants indicated they were ""very satisfied"" or ""somewhat satisfied."" In terms of property maintenance, 34 percent of residents indicated it was ""better than before,"" 54 percent said it was ""about the same,"" and only nine percent said it was ""worse than before."" Minimal Tenant Relocation - Roughly 75% of tenants who responded to the survey were living in their original unit after completion of the RAD conversion and associated construction; 63% did not move at all. An additional 18% of respondents ended up in a different unit at the same property, while other households moved to new rent-assisted properties under RAD's ""transfer of assistance"" authority. The study attempted to use HUD administrative data to track relocation for the universe of all RAD households but found that limitations in HUD's administrative data prevented this analysis. While the survey results cannot be validated with administrative data, they point to a conclusion that the RAD conversion process avoids displacement of residents from assisted housing.

Background on the RAD Program:
RAD was designed to stem the potential loss of public housing and other subsidized housing units due to the growing backlog of unfunded capital needs. The program allows Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) to creatively deploy the limited funds they have, and to leverage public and private debt and equity to address the critical backlog of public housing capital needs. In many cases, the PHAs are able to fully modernize the properties. In 2010, a HUD study estimated the capital backlog at over $25 billion. Today, HUD and third-party estimates range from $35 billion to over $70 billion. In RAD, public housing units move to the Section 8 platform under a long-term contract that, by law, must be renewed in perpetuity. A Use Agreement is also recorded ensuring the formerly public housing units remain permanently affordable to very low-income households.
Under RAD, existing public housing residents benefit from a right of return, a prohibition against re-screening, and robust notification and relocation rights. Residents continue to pay 30 percent of their adjusted income towards the rent and maintain the same basic rights as they have in the public housing program. Residents also get a new option to request tenant-based assistance if they wish to subsequently move from the property. RAD maintains public stewardship of the converted property through clear rules requiring ongoing ownership or control by a public or non-profit entity."
10/24/2019:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2019/pr19-158.cfm,HUD and Census Bureau Report New Residential Sales in September 2019,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Census Bureau jointly announced the following new residential sales statistics for September 2019:

New Home Sales
Sales of new single-family houses in September 2019 were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 701,000. This is 0.7 percent (±16.1 percent)* below the revised August rate of 706,000 but is 15.5 percent (±20.0 percent)* above the September 2018 estimate of 607,000.
Sales Price
The median sales price of new houses sold in September 2019 was $299,000. The average sales price was $362,700.
For Sale Inventory and Months' Supply
The seasonally adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of September was 321,000. This represents a supply of 5.5 months at the current sales rate.
Read more about new residential sales activity (www.census.gov/construction/nrs/index.html).
EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take three months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, six months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2 percent) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percentage change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percentage changes are 90 percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percentage changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised 3 percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at the Census Bureau's website (www.census.gov/construction/nrs/how_the_data_are_collected/index.html).
* The 90 percent confidence interval includes zero. In such cases, there is insufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero."
10/28/2019:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2019/pr19-159.cfm,HUD and Justice Department Sign Interagency Memorandum on the Application of False Claims Act,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson and U.S. Attorney General William Barr today issued a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the two agencies that sets prudential guidance on the appropriate use of the False Claims Act (FCA) for violations by Federal Housing Administration (FHA) lenders.
The MOU can be found HERE.
This agreement clearly outlines our FHA mortgage program requirements, so they do not impede or discourage lenders from offering affordable FHA-insured loans to credit-worthy borrowers,"" said Secretary Carson. ""In taking these steps, we are fulfilling an important element our Housing Finance Reform Plan and making clear to all responsible lenders that FHA's mortgage program is a program they should participate in. At the same time, HUD will not tolerate irresponsible or fraudulent lenders who defraud borrowers and taxpayers. We are thankful for the excellent relationship we have with our colleagues at the Department of Justice who have worked diligently with us on this effort and share our goal of advancing affordable housing finance while protecting the interests of taxpayers.""
""This MOU sets forth a robust and collaborative process for deciding when to pursue False Claims Act cases to remedy material and knowing FHA violations,"" said Attorney General William P. Barr. ""DOJ and HUD will work together to determine when HUD's administrative remedies are sufficient, or other recourse is appropriate, to address harm to the borrower, the taxpayer, or the government. Importantly, this MOU is the product of the excellent working relationship that has developed between our two agencies in our shared pursuit of greater clarity and fairness.""
As the MOU makes clear, HUD expects that FHA requirements will be enforced primarily through HUD's administrative proceedings, but the MOU specifically addresses how HUD and DOJ, including the U.S. Attorneys' Offices, will consult with each other regarding use of the FCA in connection with defects on mortgage loans insured by FHA. HUD will utilize the Mortgagee Review Board (MRB), which was created by statute and empowered to take certain actions for non-compliance by FHA lenders, to review and refer FCA claims. The MOU prescribes the standards for when HUD, through the MRB, may refer a matter to DOJ for pursuit of FCA claims, and also sets forth how DOJ and HUD will cooperate during the investigative, litigation, and settlement phases of FCA matters when DOJ receives a referral from a third party, such as in qui tam cases. The MOU also recognizes that application of the FCA requires, among other elements of proof, a material violation of HUD requirements, and DOJ attorneys will solicit HUD's views to determine whether the elements of the FCA can be established.
This interagency understanding is intended to address concerns that uncertain and unanticipated FCA liability for regulatory defects led to many well-capitalized lenders, including many banks and credit unions statutorily required to help meet the credit needs of the communities in which they do business, to largely withdraw from FHA lending. This has dramatically shifted FHA's lender base during the last decade. Today, depository institutions originate less than 14 percent of FHA-insured mortgages, down significantly from approximately 45 percent in 2010. It is worth noting that for decades, FHA has been the hallmark product for the nation's first time homebuyers. This important segment of the market currently constitutes over 80% of FHAs loans. Additionally, a third of FHA loans are made to minority borrowers.
The MOU is part of a comprehensive plan to bring greater clarity to regulatory expectations within the FHA program, and fulfills a key component of the HUD Housing Finance Reform Plan. In addition to the MOU, FHA is simplifying the certifications that lenders make in connection with the FHA program. The certifications will better track statutory requirements and address materiality and culpability considerations. FHA is also refining its defect taxonomy that it uses to assess the appropriate remedies for identified loan underwriting defects. Together, these new and revised components are intended to make affordable FHA-insured mortgages more accessible to qualified borrowers, reduce risks within the FHA program, and preserve appropriately tailored remedies."
10/31/2019:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2019/pr19-160.cfm,HUD Awards $1.7 Million to Public Housing Authorities to Assist Young People Aging Out of Foster Care,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson today awarded $1.7 million to nearly a dozen housing authorities to assist young people aging out of foster care and who are at risk of experiencing homelessness. See chart below.
Funded through HUD's new Foster Youth to Independence (FYI) Initiative, this funding will offer housing vouchers to local public housing authorities to prevent or end homelessness among young adults under the age of 25 who are, or have recently left, the foster care system without a home to go to. FYI requires that communities provide supportive services for the length of assistance to help youth achieve self-sufficiency. These activities center around basic life skills, landlord outreach, and job preparation. Additionally, they will receive educational and career counseling as well as counseling on program and lease compliance. This is critical given that the assistance is time limited.
""HUD wants to ensure young people who leave foster care have a smooth transition when they go out on their own,"" said HUD Secretary Carson. ""The funding announced today will allow local housing authorities to focus on helping young people find housing to keep them off the streets and prevent them from becoming homeless.""
These tenant-protection vouchers will go to public housing authorities that do not participate in HUD's Family Unification Program. The public housing authorities must:
Administer a Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) Program; Enter into a partnership agreement with a Public Child Welfare Agency (PCWA); Accept young people referred by their partnering PCWA; Determine that the referred youth are eligible for HCV assistance.
• Administer a Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) Program;
• Enter into a partnership agreement with a Public Child Welfare Agency (PCWA);
• Accept young people referred by their partnering PCWA;
• Determine that the referred youth are eligible for HCV assistance.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) estimates that more than 20,000 young people age out of foster care each year. The National Center for Housing and Child Welfare (NCHCW) estimates that approximately 25 percent of these young people experience homelessness within four years of leaving foster care and an even higher share are precariously housed."
11/05/2019:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2019/pr19-161.cfm,HUD Announces $1.5 Million Settlement with Bridgeport Housing Authority Resolving Disability Discrimination Claims,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), on November 4, negotiated a settlement with the Housing Authority of the City of Bridgeport (HACB), doing business as (DBA) Park City Communities in Connecticut, settling allegations that HACB discriminated against persons with disabilities by failing to provide accessible units and ignoring their requests for reasonable accommodations.
HACB owns and manages more than 2,600 units of public housing and administers more than 2,800 vouchers under HUD's Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program. Under the terms of the agreement, HACB will establish a $1.5 million compensation fund that will be used to make payments to individuals who were harmed by HACB's alleged discrimination and increase its housing stock to include units for people with disabilities. The proposed consent decree must still be approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut. Learn more about the settlement.
The case originally came to HUD's attention when a compliance review conducted by HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity revealed that HACB was in violation of federal disability laws. The case was referred to DOJ for enforcement, resulting in a lawsuit against HACB. According to the lawsuit, HACB failed to process and fulfill requests for accommodations from tenants with disabilities or to provide accessible public housing units for residents with disabilities.
""As a former director of a public housing agency, I know how important it is that public housing agencies provide persons who have disabilities with the type of housing that meets their needs,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD applauds this important settlement and will continue working with the Justice Department to ensure that housing providers are aware of and meet their obligation to comply with the nation's housing laws.""
HUD Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing R. Hunter Kurtz added: ""It is at the forefront of our mission to ensure that individuals with disabilities served by HUD's public housing programs have access to accessible housing and are treated fairly.""
HUD's General Counsel, Paul Compton, said, ""HUD will vigorously enforce federal civil rights laws in order to ensure individuals served by HUD programs are able to have equal, affordable housing opportunities. I am pleased that collaboration between HUD and the Justice Department resulted in this settlement.""
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from denying or limiting housing because of a person's disability and from refusing to make reasonable accommodations in policies or practices. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance. Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in all programs, services, and activities of local governments.
To learn more about the details of the proposed settlement, please refer to DOJ's Press Release here (www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-resolves-disability-discrimination-lawsuit-against-housing-authority-city). Individuals who may have been victims of discrimination by HACB or who have information relevant to the case are encouraged to contact DOJ's Civil Rights Division at 1-800-896-7743 (for English, mailbox number 992; for Spanish, mailbox number 2) or by email at Community.Bridgeport@usdoj.gov.
Persons who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (Voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to www.hud.gov/fairhousing, or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, which can be accessed through Apple devices, such as the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch."
11/08/2019:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2019/pr19-162.cfm,Secretary Carson Asks the Federal Trade Commission to Investigate Websites Selling Assistance Animal Documentation,"WASHINGTON - Recently, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson wrote to Chairman of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Joseph J. Simons and Director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection Andrew Smith requesting that the FTC investigate certain websites that may be selling assistance animal documentation.
""These certificates are not an acceptable substitute for authentic documentation provided by medical professionals when appropriate,"" said Secretary Carson. ""These websites that sell assistance animal certificates are often also misleading by implying that they are affiliated with the federal government. Nothing could be further from the truth. Their goal is to convince individuals with disabilities that they need to spend hundreds of dollars on worthless documentation to keep their assistance animal in their homes.""
The Fair Housing Act requires housing providers to grant a reasonable accommodation for individuals with disabilities that affect major life activities when it may be necessary for such individuals to have equal opportunity to enjoy and use a dwelling. One type of reasonable accommodation is an exception to a housing provider's rules regarding animals to permit individuals with disabilities to keep assistance animals that do work, perform tasks, or assist individuals with disabilities. Documentation, such as a note from a healthcare professional, is helpful and appropriate when a disability is not obvious and not already known.
HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, Anna Maria Farías, explained, ""Websites that sell verification for assistance animals take advantage of persons with disabilities who need a reasonable accommodation to keep their assistance animal in housing. This request for FTC action reflects HUD's ongoing commitment to protecting the housing rights of persons with disabilities.""
""These certificates are not an acceptable substitute for the authentic certification received from medical professionals and the websites are misleading because they often imply, they are affiliated with the federal government,"" said Secretary Carson. ""Nothing could be further from the truth. Their goal is to convince individuals with disabilities that they need to spend hundreds of dollars on worthless documentation to keep their assistance animal in their homes.""
""The Fair Housing Act provides for the use of assistance animals by individuals with disabilities. Under the law, a disability is a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits at least one major life activity or bodily function,"" said HUD's General Counsel Paul Compton. ""These websites are using questionable business practices that exploit consumers, prejudice the legal rights of individuals with disabilities, dupe landlords, and generally interfere with good faith efforts to comply with the requirements of the Fair Housing Act.""
The letter asks the FTC to investigate these websites for compliance with federal laws that protect consumers from unfair and deceptive acts or practices. HUD identified at least one website that contains the seal of HUD without authorization.
Persons who are concerned about these websites may contact the Federal Trade Commission by calling the FTC's Consumer Response Center at 1-877-FTC-HELP (1-877-382-4357), or online (www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/#crnt&panel1-1). Persons who believe they have experienced housing discrimination may file a complaint of discrimination by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 or visiting How to File a Complaint on HUD's website.

11/12/2019:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2019/pr19-163.cfm,Trump Administration Announces Continued Decline in Veteran Homelessness,"WASHINGTON - During a press conference today at Harbor Homes in Manchester, New Hampshire, U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson announced veteran homelessness in the U.S. continues to decline according to a new national estimate. HUD's Annual Homeless Assessment Report indicates the total number of reported veterans experiencing homelessness in 2019 decreased 2.1 percent and 793 more veterans now have a roof over their heads. View local estimates of veteran homelessness (www.hudexchange.info/resource/5877/2019-pit-estimate-of-veteran-homelessness-in-the-us).
""Our nation's veterans have sacrificed so much for our country and now it's our duty to make certain they have a home to call their own,"" said Secretary Carson. ""We've made great progress in our efforts to end veteran homelessness, but we still have a lot of work to do to ensure our heroes have access to affordable housing.""
Each year, thousands of local communities around the country conduct one-night ""Point-in-Time"" estimates of the number of persons experiencing homelessness—in emergency shelters, transitional housing programs and in unsheltered locations. This year's estimate finds 37,085 veterans experienced homelessness in January 2019, compared to 37,878 reported in January 2018. HUD estimates among the total number of reported veterans experiencing homelessness in 2019, 22,740 veterans were found in sheltered settings while volunteers counted 14,345 veterans living in places not meant for human habitation.
These declines are the result of intense planning and targeted interventions, including the close collaboration between HUD and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Both agencies jointly administer the HUD-VA Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) Program, which combines permanent HUD rental assistance with case management and clinical services provided by the VA. HUD-VASH is complemented by a continuum of VA programs that use modern tools and technology to identify the most vulnerable Veterans and rapidly connect them to the appropriate interventions to become and remain stably housed. This year to date, more than 11,000 veterans, many experiencing chronic forms of homelessness, found permanent housing and critically needed support services through the HUD-VASH program.
To date, 78 local communities and three states have declared an effective end to veteran homelessness, creating systems to ensure that a veteran's homelessness is rare, brief, and a one-time encounter. Read more (www.usich.gov/communities-that-have-ended-homelessness).
HUD and VA have a wide range of programs that prevent and end homelessness among veterans, including health care, housing solutions, job training and education. More information about VA's homeless programs is available at VA.gov/homeless (www.va.gov/homeless). More information about HUD's program is available here. Veterans who are homeless or at imminent risk of becoming homeless should contact their local VA Medical Center and ask to speak to a homeless coordinator or call the National Call Center for Homeless Veterans at 1-877-4AID-VET."
11/14/2019:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2019/pr19-164.cfm,FHA Releases 2019 Annual Report to Congress,"WASHINGTON - The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) today released its 2019 Annual Report to Congress on the economic condition of the agency's Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMI Fund). FHA reports that at the end of Fiscal Year (FY) 2019, The FHA MMI Fund Capital Ratio for FY 2019 was 4.84 percent, the highest level since FY 2007.
The MMI Fund supports FHA's single-family mortgage insurance programs, including all forward mortgage purchase and refinance transactions, as well as mortgages insured under the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM), or reverse mortgage program, since FY 2009.
""The financial health of FHA's single-family insurance fund is as sound as it has been in over a decade,"" said U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson. ""We have a strong economy with nearly full employment due to President Trump's leadership, and this economic growth helps set the foundation for ongoing improvements in our FHA portfolio.""
Commissioner Montgomery added, ""This report is welcome news. The improvements we've begun to put in place in the last two years to stem the losses of the reverse mortgage portfolio, aided by favorable economic conditions, are contributing to some improvements in our reverse mortgage portfolio. Looking forward, we must focus on seeking the right balance between facilitating access to mortgage credit and managing risk. Our mission is to make certain FHA remains a stable and reliable resource to provide housing finance support for first-time homebuyers, and other underserved borrowers.""
KEY HIGHLIGHTS FROM FHA'S 2019 ANNUAL REPORT
Congress has set a mandatory minimum Capital Ratio of 2 percent for the MMI Fund. The Capital Ratio for FY 2019 was 4.84 percent, the highest level since FY 2007. The Capital Ratio is one indicator of the Fund's financial health and includes both FHA-insured single family forward and reverse mortgage portfolios. As detailed in today's FY 2019 annual report to Congress, FHA had insurance-in-force on single family mortgages valued at almost $1.3 trillion at the end of this fiscal year. The performance of the forward book of business posted a stand-alone capital ratio of 5.44 percent. The MMI Capital (formerly referred to as economic net worth) of the forward book of business also improved year-to-year by over 42 percent with a value of over $66.6 billion.

11/14/2019:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2019/pr19-165.cfm,HUD Reaches Settlement with California Housing Providers Accused of Disability Discrimination,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced today that it has reached a Conciliation/Voluntary Compliance Agreement with housing providers in San Diego, Sacramento and Oceanside, CA, settling allegations that they violated the Fair Housing Act and other laws when they refused to install grab bars in the showers of elderly tenants with disabilities and subsequently retaliated against them for making the requests. Read the agreement.
The providers include Mission Cove Seniors Housing Associates, L.P, Carolyn Compass Rose, LLC, Community Housing Works, Inc. of San Diego, ConAm Management Corporation of Sacramento, and the city of Oceanside, California.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from denying or limiting housing to persons with disabilities, including retaliating against individuals who make accommodation requests. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance, including refusing to make reasonable accommodations. In addition, Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in all activities, services and programs of public entities.
""The smallest accommodations mean a lot to individuals with disabilities,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""We welcome today's settlement and hope that it reminds housing providers everywhere of the importance of meeting their obligation to comply with the nation's fair housing laws.""
The case came to HUD's attention when a married couple with disabilities who live in a HUD subsidized senior apartment complex filed a complaint alleging that the owner and property manager of the complex refused to install grab bars in their bathroom and subsequently retaliated against them for making the request. Specifically, the couple claimed that after they asked for the accommodation, they were issued a notice accusing them of having created a noise disturbance. The housing providers denied discriminating against the couple but agreed to settle their complaint.
Under the terms of the settlement agreement, Mission Cove Seniors Housing Associates will pay $23,228 to the Legal Aid Society of San Diego, Inc. ($3,576 to cover the cost of legal services it provided and $19,652 for the complainants) and will rescind the noise complaint that was issued against the couple.

11/15/2019:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2019/pr19-167.cfm,HUD Announces Settlement with Owners of Georgia Apartment Complex Resolving Housing Discrimination Claim,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has reached a $80,000 Conciliation/Voluntary Compliance Agreement with Oglethorpe Square Apartments, LP, of Savannah, GA, and Gene B. Glick Company, Inc., of Indianapolis, IN. The agreement settles allegations that the owners and management agent for the Woods of Savannah apartment complex subjected African-American tenants at the property to repeated instances of racial harassment by white tenants, which included verbal attacks and physical assaults. Read the agreement.
The Fair Housing Act makes it illegal to discriminate in housing because of race or color, which includes failing to take measures to end tenant-on-tenant harassment and denying tenants' maintenance requests.
""No one should ever have to face threats or be subjected to physical violence in the place they call home because of their race,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""The agreement we're announcing today is a reminder to housing providers everywhere that HUD is committed to ensuring that they meet their obligation to comply with the nation's fair housing laws.""
The case came to HUD's attention when three African-American residents of The Woods of Savannah filed complaints claiming that the owners of the property refused to investigate and address their claims that white tenants had subjected them to racial harassment and verbal and physical assaults, including attacks by dogs. The three residents further alleged that the property's management ignored their maintenance requests and delayed the maintenance requests of other African-American residents. The housing provider denied discriminating against the residents but agreed to settle their complaints.
Under the terms of the agreement, Oglethorpe Square Apartments, LP, and Gene B. Glick Company will pay the three residents who filed complaints $20,000 each, and create a $20,000 fund to compensate other residents who may have been subjected to racial harassment. The owners also agreed to provide annual fair housing training for the staff and on-site management of The Woods of Savannah.
Persons who believe they have experienced housing discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (Voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to www.hud.gov/fairhousing."

EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take three months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, six months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2 percent) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percentage change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percentage changes are 90 percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percentage changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised 3 percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at the Census Bureau's website (www.census.gov/construction/nrc/how_the_data_are_collected/index.html).
* The 90 percent confidence interval includes zero. In such cases, there is insufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero."
11/20/2019:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2019/pr19-169.cfm,HUD Awards more than $130 Million to Provide Affordable Housing to People with Disabilities,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today awarded $131.3 million to 325 local public housing authorities across the country to provide affordable housing to approximately 15,363 additional non-elderly persons with disabilities. Secretary Ben Carson made the national announcement during a visit to Detroit, Michigan. The Detroit Housing Commission received $597,629 to serve the residents in their community living with disabilities. See the local impact of the housing assistance announced today.
""At HUD we're committed to ensuring people with disabilities have a decent, safe, and affordable place to live,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""The funding announced today allows our local partners to continue helping residents with disabilities live independently.""
The housing assistance announced today is provided through the HUD's Mainstream Housing Choice Voucher Program which provides funding to housing agencies to assist non-elderly persons with disabilities, particularly those who are transitioning out of institutional or other separated settings; at serious risk of institutionalization; currently experiencing homelessness; previously experienced homelessness and currently a client in a permanent supportive housing or rapid rehousing project; or at risk of becoming homeless.
This program helps to further the goals of the Americans with Disabilities Act by helping persons with disabilities live in the most integrated setting. The program also encourages partnerships with health and human service agencies with a demonstrated capacity to coordinate voluntary services and supports to enable individuals to live independently in the community."
11/22/2019:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2019/pr19-170.cfm,Secretary Ben Carson Announces New Incentives Package for Purchase or Rehabilitation of Single Family Properties in Opportunity Zones,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson today announced that the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) will offer a new incentive for borrowers interested in rehabilitating homes in Opportunity Zones. FHA is effectuating this through an expansion of its Limited 203(k) Rehabilitation Mortgage Insurance Program (available to owner occupant homebuyers and existing occupant homeowners for the purchase and/or rehabilitation of single family homes) for homes located in Opportunity Zones across the nation. Read today's Mortgagee Letter.
Beginning December 16, homebuyers seeking to purchase a home in a qualified Opportunity Zone can use the Limited 203(k) program to finance rehabilitation costs up to $50,000 into the total mortgage amount. This is an increase of $15,000 over the Limited 203(k) rehab maximum amount of $35,000 allowed through the program on single family homes not located in Opportunity Zones. Existing homeowners with homes in Opportunity Zones can also use the larger allowable rehabilitation amount when refinancing to rehabilitate their existing homes.
""Providing this opportunity means that the families seeking affordable homeownership or to improve their homes in distressed neighborhoods - where rehabilitation is needed the most - have a path to financing that makes it realistic to do the repairs and improvements that will uplift the entire community,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson.
FHA's Limited 203(k) program permits homebuyers and homeowners to finance rehabilitation costs into their mortgage to repair, improve, or upgrade their home, allowing them to tap into cash to pay for property repairs or improvements, such as those identified by a home inspector or an appraiser. Allowable improvements include connecting to public water and sewage systems, repairing or replacing plumbing, heating, air conditioning or electrical systems, and covering lead-based paint stabilization costs.
As of September 30, 2019, FHA had active insurance on over 623,000 mortgages for eligible homes located in Opportunity Zones. This represents eight percent of FHA-insured mortgages nationwide. The incentive announced today will be limited to the first 15,000 mortgages secured by properties in Qualified Opportunity Zones each calendar year. The incentive will expire on December 31, 2028.
Opportunity Zones
Created under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Opportunity Zones are designed to stimulate economic development and job creation in distressed low-income communities by incentivizing long-term capital investment. The program offers capital gains tax relief to those who invest in these targeted distressed areas. This program is anticipated to spur approximately $100 billion of private capital investment in Opportunity Zones. There are more than 8,700 census tracts designated as Opportunity Zones in all 50 States and in the U.S. territories.

11/26/2019:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2019/pr19-171.cfm,HUD Issues Request for Information on Eliminating Regulatory Barriers to Affordable Housing,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today published a Request for Information (RFI) seeking public comment on Federal, State, local, and Tribal laws, regulations, land use requirements, and administrative practices that artificially raise the costs of affordable housing development and contribute to shortages in America's housing supply.
This RFI is a request for members of the public to share their knowledge and provide recommendations to HUD regarding regulations, and practices that unnecessarily impede housing supply and information on innovative practices that promote increased housing supply. Read the RFI here (www.regulations.gov/document?D=HUD_FRDOC_0001-5420).
""Owning a home is an essential component of the American Dream. It is imperative that we remove regulatory barriers that prevent that dream from becoming a reality,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""Through this request, communities across the country will have the opportunity to identify roadblocks to affordable housing and work with State, Federal, and local leaders to remove them.""
In this RFI, HUD is seeking information on the following:
Specific HUD regulations, statutes, programs, and practices that directly or indirectly restrict the supply of housing or increase the cost of housing; Policy interventions, solutions, or strategies available to State, local, and Federal decision makers to incentivize State and local governments to review their regulatory environment or aid them in streamlining, reducing or eliminating the negative impact of State and local laws, regulations, and administrative practices; Ways that State-level laws, practices, and programs contribute to delays in the construction industry and specific laws, practices, and programs that could be reviewed; Common motivations or factors that underlie local governments' adoption of laws, regulations, and practices that demonstrably raise the cost of housing development, and whether such factors vary geographically; Peer-reviewed research and/or representative surveys that provide quantitative analyses on the impact of regulations on the cost of affordable housing development; Performance measures, quantitative and/or qualitative, the Council should consider in assessing the reduction of barriers nationally or regionally and advantages and disadvantages of each measure; and Recommendations on how to best utilize HUD's Regulatory Barriers Clearinghouse for States, local governments, researchers and policy analysts who are tracking reform activity across the country.
• Specific HUD regulations, statutes, programs, and practices that directly or indirectly restrict the supply of housing or increase the cost of housing;
• Policy interventions, solutions, or strategies available to State, local, and Federal decision makers to incentivize State and local governments to review their regulatory environment or aid them in streamlining, reducing or eliminating the negative impact of State and local laws, regulations, and administrative practices;
• Ways that State-level laws, practices, and programs contribute to delays in the construction industry and specific laws, practices, and programs that could be reviewed;
• Common motivations or factors that underlie local governments' adoption of laws, regulations, and practices that demonstrably raise the cost of housing development, and whether such factors vary geographically;
• Peer-reviewed research and/or representative surveys that provide quantitative analyses on the impact of regulations on the cost of affordable housing development;
• Performance measures, quantitative and/or qualitative, the Council should consider in assessing the reduction of barriers nationally or regionally and advantages and disadvantages of each measure; and
• Recommendations on how to best utilize HUD's Regulatory Barriers Clearinghouse for States, local governments, researchers and policy analysts who are tracking reform activity across the country.
This RFI is a part of the work Secretary Carson is undertaking as the Chair of the White House Council on Eliminating Regulatory Barriers to Affordable Housing. The Council's eight Federal member agencies are engaging with governments at all levels—State, local, and tribal—and other private-sector stakeholders on ways to increase the housing supply so more Americans have access to affordable housing.
President Trump signed Executive Order 13878, ""Establishing a White House Council on Eliminating Regulatory Barriers to Affordable Housing,"" due to the fact that, for many Americans, the supply of available housing has not kept pace with the demand for housing by prospective renters and homebuyers, driving up housing costs. Regulations are often necessary to protect the health and safety of American citizens, such as clean air, water or disaster mitigation practices. However, outdated and overly burdensome, time-consuming, and costly regulatory requirements and restrictions prolong the completion of new housing supply and those costs are shifted to the consumer, particularly in tight markets.
As the Executive Order states, ""Increasing the supply of housing by removing overly burdensome regulatory barriers will reduce housing costs, boost economic growth, and provide more Americans with opportunities for economic mobility. In addition, it will strengthen American communities and the quality of services offered in them by allowing hardworking Americans to live in or near the communities they serve.""

Funded through HUD's Self-Help Homeownership Opportunity Program (SHOP), these grants, along with the labor contributions from homebuyers and volunteers, will significantly lower the cost of construction, thus making homeownership a reality for families who otherwise would not be able to afford to buy a home.
""These non-profits receiving grants are making a positive impact in communities across the country through the strong partnerships they have formed between the public and private sector,"" said David C. Woll, Jr., HUD's Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development. ""These grants, in conjunction with volunteer work and private donations, will help make the dream of homeownership a reality for more families.""
The following organizations will receive SHOP funds, and were awarded two Opportunity Zone preference points each during the FY2019 SHOP Competition:
About the SHOP Program
The SHOP program provides federal grants on a competitive basis to national and regional non-profit organizations and consortia that have experience in administering self-help homeownership housing programs. The SHOP grants must be used to purchase land and make necessary infrastructure improvements, which together may not exceed an average SHOP investment of $15,000 per dwelling unit. Leveraged funds must be used for the construction or rehabilitation of these homeownership units.
Newly constructed units will receive certification as ENERGY STAR qualified units. All appliances, products or features that are installed or replaced will be ENERGY STAR qualified. Water usage products will bear the WaterSense label. Many units will also have ""Green,"" ""Healthy Homes,"" and ""Universal Design"" features.
Homebuyers will contribute significant sweat equity toward the development of their units and/or the units of other homebuyers participating in the local self-help housing programs. These sweat equity contributions reduce the purchase price of the SHOP units and make these units affordable for low-income homebuyers. A minimum of 100 sweat equity hours is required from a household of two or more persons. A minimum of 50 sweat equity hours is required from a household of one person. Community participation consisting of volunteer labor contributions is also required. Sweat equity and volunteer labor may include, but are not limited to, landscaping, foundation work, painting, carpentry, trim work, drywall, roofing and siding for the housing. Reasonable accommodations must be made for persons with disabilities.
Grantees may carry out activities directly and/or distribute SHOP funds to local non-profit affiliates that will develop the SHOP units, select homebuyers, coordinate the homebuyer sweat equity and volunteer efforts, and assist in the arrangement of interim and permanent financing for the homebuyers. The grantees ensure that the new homebuyers can afford their homes at the time of purchase and for the long term. Many of the SHOP homebuyers are first-time homeowners and come from underserved groups.

Over the last year, the number of veterans experiencing homelessness declined by two percent and has dropped by nearly 50 percent since the HUD-VASH program was created.
""President Trump has made ending veteran homelessness a priority and with his leadership we have continued to see it decline. Our nation's veterans have given so much for our country and freedom,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""It is our duty to make certain every single veteran has a place they can call home.""
""President Trump remains committed to using every tool at our disposal to help veterans exit homelessness and remain in stable housing,"" said VA Secretary Robert Wilkie. ""HUD-VASH has been critical to the nearly 50% decline in veteran homelessness since 2010 and is proof that the federal government and local agencies are capable of solving complex problems together.""
With the addition of this new award, more than 100,000 vouchers have been awarded and more than 170,000 homeless veterans have been served through the HUD-VASH program since 2008. More than 600 PHAs already administer the HUD-VASH program, and this most recent award includes 37 additional PHAs, increasing HUD-VASH coverage to several new communities. Rental assistance and supportive services provided through HUD-VASH are a critical resource for local communities in ending homelessness among our nation's veterans.
In the HUD-VASH program, VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) assess veterans experiencing homelessness before referring them to local housing agencies for these vouchers. Decisions are based on a variety of factors, most importantly the duration of homelessness and the need for longer term, more intensive support in obtaining and maintaining permanent housing. The HUD-VASH program includes both the rental assistance the voucher provides and the comprehensive case management that VAMC staff offers.
Veterans participating in the HUD-VASH program rent privately owned housing and generally contribute no more than 30 percent of their income toward rent. VA offers eligible homeless veterans clinical and supportive services through its medical centers across the U.S., Guam, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands."
12/20/2019:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2019/pr19-177.cfm,"Secretary Carson Certifies Annual Data: Homelessness Ticked Up in 2019, Driven by Major Increases in California","WASHINGTON - Ahead of the release of the 2019 Annual Homelessness Report to Congress, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson certified data related to the study. While the rest of the country experienced a combined decrease in homelessness in 2019, significant increases in unsheltered and chronic homelessness on the West Coast, particularly California and Oregon, offset those nationwide decreases, causing an overall increase in homelessness of 2.7 percent in 2019, according to the latest national estimate by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The study found that 567,715 persons experienced homelessness on a single night in 2019, an increase of 14,885 people since 2018. Meanwhile, homelessness among veterans and families with children continued to fall, declining 2.1 percent and 4.8 percent, respectively, in 2019.
There is significant local variation reported from different parts of the country. Twenty-nine states and the District of Columbia reported declines in homelessness between 2018 and 2019, while 21 states reported increases in the number of persons experiencing homelessness. Homelessness in California increased by 21,306 people, or 16.4 percent, which is more than the total national increase of every other state combined.
""As we look across our nation, we see great progress, but we're also seeing a continued increase in street homelessness along our West Coast where the cost of housing is extremely high,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""In fact, homelessness in California is at a crisis level and needs to be addressed by local and state leaders with crisis-like urgency. Addressing these challenges will require a broader, community-wide response that engages every level of government to compassionately house our fellow citizens who call the streets their home.""
HUD's national estimate is based upon data reported by approximately 3,000 cities and counties across the nation. Every year on a single night in January, planning agencies called ""Continuums of Care,"" (COC) along with tens of thousands of volunteers, seek to identify the number of individuals and families living in emergency shelters, transitional housing programs, and in unsheltered settings. These one-night 'snapshot' counts, as well as full-year counts and data from other sources (U.S. Housing Survey, Department of Education), are crucial in understanding the scope of homelessness and measuring progress toward reducing it.
Key Findings
On a single night in January 2019, state and local planning agencies (Continuums of Care) reported:
567,715 people were homeless, representing an overall 2.7 percent increase from 2018 but a nearly 11 percent decline since 2010. 37,085 Veterans were reported as homeless, a decline of 2.1 percent from 2018 and 50 percent since 2010. 53,692 families with children experienced homelessness last January, down nearly 5 percent from 2018 and more than 32 percent since 2010. Homelessness increased in California by 21,306 people, or 16.4 percent, accounting for more than the entire national increase. The estimated number of persons experiencing long-term, chronic homelessness increased 8.5 percent between 2018 and 2019. This increase was concentrated on the West Coast, with the largest increases in California. The number of unaccompanied homeless youth and children in 2019 is estimated to be 35,038, a 3.6 percent decline since 2018. HUD and local communities are engaged in a more intense effort to more accurately account for this important, difficult-to-count population.

Homelessness in California
California reported a large increase of 21,306 persons experiencing homelessness, or 16.4 percent. Last year's increases are particularly noteworthy among unsheltered individuals and the chronically homeless.
Veteran Homelessness
Homelessness among veterans is half of what was reported in 2010. Last year alone, the number of veterans experiencing homelessness declined by 2.1 percent. These declines are the result of intense planning and targeted interventions, including the close collaboration between HUD and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). These agencies jointly administer the HUD-VA Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) Program, which combines permanent HUD rental assistance with case management and clinical services provided by the VA. This year, more than 4,400 veterans, many experiencing chronic forms of homelessness, will find permanent housing and critically needed support services through the HUD-VASH program. An additional 50,000 veterans found permanent housing and supportive services through VA's continuum of homelessness programs.
Family Homelessness
Local communities continue to report declines in homelessness among families with children in the U.S. In January of 2019, there were 53,692 family households with children experiencing homelessness, a decline of five percent between 2018 and 2019 and of 27 percent between 2007 and 2019. Following HUD's guidance and data-driven evidence and best practices, local planners are increasingly relying upon interventions to move families into permanent housing more quickly and at lower cost. Communities are using more robust coordinated entry efforts, which has proven to be an effective response in helping families experiencing temporary crises, as well as those enduring the most chronic forms of homelessness.
Chronic Homelessness
Long-term or chronic homelessness among individuals with disabilities grew 8.5 percent since 2018 while falling 9.4 percent below the levels reported in 2010. This longer trend is due in large measure to more permanent supportive housing opportunities available for people with disabling health conditions who otherwise continually cycle through local shelters or the streets.

12/20/2019:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2019/pr19-178.cfm,HUD Commemorates Anniversary of Opportunity Zones Initiative,"WASHINGTON - Today, HUD commemorated the anniversary of the signing of the 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act into law with the release of a whiteboard video and a podcast episode, each focused on the successes that have resulted from the law.
In particular, Opportunity Zones were created as part of the tax reform package, designed to stimulate long-term investments in low-income communities. The Opportunity Zones tax incentive is designed to spur economic development and job creation in low-income communities through preferential tax treatment for those investing certain eligible capital gains into Opportunity Zones. It is anticipated that Opportunity Zones will spur $100 billion in private capital investment in communities across the country. Incentivizing investment in low-income communities fosters economic revitalization, stimulates job creation, and promotes sustainable economic growth across the nation, especially in communities HUD serves. Just this week, the U.S. Department of the Treasury issued final regulations (https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm864) implementing the Opportunity Zones tax incentive.
""The Opportunity Zones initiative is focused on lifting up those 'forgotten communities' that have been neglected in the past."" Secretary Carson said. ""The Trump Administration is focused on bringing economic prosperity to all Americans, so that even the folks in those 'forgotten communities' who were left behind in the past have a shot at climbing the ladder of economic success.""
""Under the Opportunity Zones initiative, we are helping people to realize their potential by bringing public and private investment into these Opportunity Zones,"" said Scott Turner, Executive Director of the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council.
In 2018, President Trump signed Executive Order 13853 (www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/12/18/2018-27515/establishing-the-white-house-opportunity-and-revitalization-council) establishing the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council and named Secretary Carson chair of the Council, of which Scott Turner serves as Executive Director. The Council's 17 Federal agencies and Federal-State partnerships have been engaging with governments at all levels on ways to more effectively use taxpayer dollars to revitalize low-income communities. Additionally, the Council is charged with evaluating and removing barriers to revitalization efforts and encouraging capital investment in economically distressed communities. Since its creation, the Council has taken more than 175 actions and has made more than 50 visits to communities designated as Opportunity Zones.
The whiteboard video serves as an educational tool designed to inform the public about how Opportunity Zones work in their community. The whiteboard video can be viewed in full on www.OpportunityZones.gov. Watch the whiteboard video.
The podcast is part of a larger series, ""House Keys; Unlocking insights to the nation's leading housers"" and focuses on the work of the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council through an interview with Executive Director Scott Turner. Listen to the podcast episode."
12/27/2019:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2019/pr19-179.cfm,HUD Awards $5 Million to Public Housing Authorities to Help Tenants Relocate,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today awarded $8 million to public housing authorities to provide tenant protection vouchers to public housing residents. These vouchers will help families with relocation or replacement housing from demolition or mandatory conversion of their public housing units. Additionally, the vouchers will provide assistance to families living in section 8 projects for which the owner is opting out of the housing assistance payment (HAP) contract. See chart below.
Public Housing Authorities are awarded housing choice vouchers for relocation and replacements in connection with a HUD-approved plan to demolish or dispose of public housing developments.
""When a family living in public housing finds out that their unit will no longer be available, we want to make sure they are not displaced,"" said Hunter Kurtz, Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing. ""This funding allows HUD to keep its commitment of ensuring people have a decent, safe, and affordable place to live.""
The housing assistance announced today is provided through HUD's Housing Choice Voucher Program, which provides funding that assists very low-income families, the elderly, and the disabled to afford decent, safe, and sanitary housing in the private market."
12/31/2019:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2019/pr19-180.cfm,HUD Awards Nearly $80 Million to Help Families Reach Self-Sufficiency,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson today awarded more than $79 million to nearly 700 public housing authorities across the country. These funds will help residents of public housing and voucher-assisted housing increase their earned income and reduce their dependency on public assistance and rental subsidies. Read more about the local impact of the grants announced today.

""Helping people find jobs that will put them on the path to self-sufficiency is at the core of HUD's mission,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""HUD is committed to working with our local partners to connect families with the opportunities and support they need to succeed at every level.""
HUD's FSS Program funding helps local public housing authorities to hire Service Coordinators who work directly with residents to connect them with existing programs and services in the local community. These Service Coordinators build relationships with networks of local service providers, who provide direct assistance to FSS participants. The broad spectrum of services made possible through FSS enables participating families to find jobs, increase earned income, reduce or eliminate the need for rental and/or welfare assistance, and make progress toward achieving economic independence and housing self-sufficiency.
Participants in the program sign a five-year contract requiring the head of the household to obtain employment. In addition, no member of the FSS family may have received cash welfare assistance for twelve months prior to program graduation. Families in the FSS program have an interest-bearing escrow account established for them. The amount credited to the family's escrow account is based on increases in the family's earned income during the term of the FSS contract. FSS participants who successfully complete the requirements of their FSS contract receive the escrow funds upon completion and are able to apply those funds to advance their personal circumstances, including, for example, paying educational expenses or making a down-payment on a home.
Over ninety percent of FY19 FSS awards are to public housing authorities with units in Opportunity Zones. Created under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Opportunity Zones aim to stimulate long-term investments in low-income communities.
