The company has entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the citations that includes providing enhancements to their safety and health program to further protect employees. The company will pay penalties of $81,450. ""Pressed Paperboard Technologies has a responsibility to protect workers from electrical hazards at work,"" said Kim Nelson, OSHA's area director in Toledo. ""These hazards expose workers to the dangers of arc flash, electric shock and electrocution. Employers must train workers to work safely with electricity (link is external) ."" Two willful violations of federal safety standards concerning electrical work were cited after maintenance employees worked on energized electrical equipment without proper training and personal protective equipment. A willful violation is one committed with intentional, knowing or voluntary disregard for the law's requirement, or plain indifference to employee safety and health. Five serious safety violations include failing to develop machine-specific procedures to prevent accidental startup or movement of machine parts that can cause injury; not training workers in lockout/tagout procedures when conducting maintenance on machinery; failing to disconnect electrical panels from all energy sources prior to conducting maintenance work; inadequate machine guarding on milling machines; and failing to test electrical personal protective equipment every six months. Two serious health violations involve exposing workers to explosion and fire hazards while working near an indoor dust collector that lacked a means of explosion protection, and failing to establish and implement a written respiratory protection program. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known. The company has 15 business days from receipt of its citations and penalties to comply, request an informal conference with OSHA's area director, or contest the findings before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. To ask questions, obtain compliance assistance, file a complaint, or report workplace hospitalizations, fatalities or situations posing imminent danger to workers, the public should call OSHA's toll-free hotline at 800-321-OSHA (6742) or the agency's Toledo Area Office at 419-259-7542.

OSHA found employees working on a residential roof without fall protection. Proposed penalties total $55,000. ""This employer has been previously cited for failing to provide fall and eye protection and continues to expose workers to serious injury or death,"" said Brian Sturtecky, OSHA's area director in Jacksonville. ""Falls remain among the deadliest hazards in the construction industry. The safety and well-being of employees depends on effective fall protection on all job sites."" The repeat violations, carrying penalties of $55,000, are associated with inspections in 2010, 2011 and 2012. The company was cited during this inspection for failure to provide a fall protection system for employees working at heights greater than 6 feet and not providing eye protection for employees. A repeat violation exists when an employer previously has been cited for the same or a similar violation of a standard, regulation, rule or order at any facility in federal enforcement states within the last five years. The other-than-serious violation was cited for not having first aid supplies or a kit to protect workers from infections and injuries. An other-than-serious violation is one that has a direct relationship to job safety and health, but probably would not cause death or serious physical harm. OSHA's fall prevention campaign provides employers and workers with lifesaving information and educational materials about working safely from ladders, scaffolds and roofs. It was developed in partnership with the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health and NIOSH's National Occupational Research Agenda program. More information on fall protection standards is available in English and Spanish at http://www.osha.gov/stopfalls . In 2012, there were 269 fall-related fatalities out of the 775 construction-related fatalities. Coastal Building Systems is a full-service roofing and siding contractor.

Main updated NSSGA's board of directors on recent actions taken by the Mine Safety and Health Administration to improve miner safety and health. The NSSGA represents companies that produce more than 90 percent of the crushed stone and 70 percent of the sand and gravel consumed annually in the United States. In his remarks, Main stated that mine safety has been on a steady path of improvement since the agency began implementing reforms in 2010, including the Rules to Live By (link is external) initiative that focuses on the most common causes of mining deaths, impact inspections of problem mines, and the ""Pattern of Violations"" (link is external) program targeting chronic violators. The latter initiative has resulted in improved compliance, reduced injuries and an 83 percent reduction in the number of chronic violators. The industry as a whole achieved the lowest fatality and injury rates (link is external) in the history of mining in 2011 and again in 2012, a trend that continued through FY 2013. From 2010 through 2013, there has been a 25 percent decrease in violations in the metal and nonmetal mining industry. Main noted, however, that in the last quarter of 2013, there were nine metal and nonmetal mining deaths, a trend that MSHA is working to reverse. MSHA has worked with stakeholders to identify areas to improve compliance and miners' safety and health. The results have been positive. Outreach on guarding standards (link is external) have resulted in a 40 percent improvement in compliance and, since the publication of a Program Policy Letter recognizing Occupational Safety and Health Administration standards on fall protection (link is external) , fall protection violations have dropped 25 percent. MSHA also issued a policy letter recognizing OSHA's hazard communication standard (link is external) and, just last month, rolled out a new ladder safety (link is external) training tool. Main noted also that MSHA completed nearly 100 actions based on recommendations identified by the internal review of the 2010 Upper Big Branch mine (link is external) disaster; helped create the Holmes Mine Rescue Association (link is external) ; reformed coal, metal and nonmetal mine rescue training contests (link is external) ; improved enforcement of workplace safety discrimination cases; and significantly reduced the backlog of cases pending before the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission (link is external) , from a peak of more than 89,000 contested violations in 2010 to about 31,000 in 2013."

"March 4, 2014",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20140304,WHD News Release: US Labor Department files suit against Brown Derby Roadhouse to recover unpaid wages and damages for 18 servers at Akron restaurant [03/04/2014],"AKRON, Ohio  The U.S. Department of Labor has filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, Eastern Division, to recover unpaid wages and liquidated damages for 18 workers at Brown Derby Roadhouse in Akron. In addition to wages and damages, the suit also seeks a court order permanently enjoining CPS Foods Ltd., and its operators Gillian Harris and Gary Harris, from violating the Fair Labor Standards Act in the future. An investigation by the department's Wage and Hour Division found violations of the minimum wage, overtime, child labor and record-keeping provisions of the FLSA by CPS Foods Ltd., which operates the restaurant. Investigators from the division's Columbus District Office found that the company misclassified servers as independent contractors and, for a time, unlawfully paid no wages for their hours worked. Servers received tips only and were required to pay a daily table fee to the employer for the right to work. In addition to the unpaid wages of $24,199, an equal amount of liquidated damages is included in the suit. The department is also seeking civil money penalties of $23,472 for repeatedly failing to comply with the FLSA and for allowing a minor to operate a trash compactor, an occupation prohibited for minors in DOL regulations. The firm was found in violation of the same child labor regulation in 2012, and unpaid penalties for those violations are included in this case. ""We continue to see problems in the restaurant industry, which employs some of our country's lowest-paid workers. These are vulnerable workers, and complete failure to pay wages and failure to pay minimum wage and overtime that is legally due impacts these workers, their families and communities,"" said George Victory, district director for the Wage and Hour Division in Columbus. ""These violations also create an unlawful competitive edge for those who break the law. The Wage and Hour Division is committed to promoting awareness of wage laws and to ensuring compliance, so that all American workers are paid their rightful wages, and the playing field is leveled for all employers."" Investigators determined that the company violated the minimum wage by failing to compensate servers at an hourly rate. Minimum wage employees were also charged a fee if they elected to receive a paper check instead of direct deposit. The company also failed to pay workers at one and one-half times their hourly rate for hours worked beyond 40 in a workweek and to maintain accurate records of hours worked. A prior investigation in 2012 found almost identical minimum wage and overtime violations — from paying an insufficient cash wage to tipped employees, charging employees to receive wages via direct deposit or payroll check and paying straight time for overtime hours. The company paid back wages to those employees. The misclassification of workers as something other than employees, such as independent contractors, presents a serious problem for affected employees, employers and to the economy. Misclassified employees are often denied access to critical benefits and protections, such as family and medical leave, overtime, minimum wage and unemployment insurance. Employee misclassification also generates substantial losses to state and federal Treasuries, and to Social Security and Medicare funds, as well as to state unemployment insurance and workers' compensation funds. The FLSA requires that covered, nonexempt employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour for all hours worked, plus time and one-half their regular rates of pay for hours worked beyond 40 per week. In accordance with the FLSA, an employer of a tipped employee is required to pay no less than $2.13 an hour in direct wages, provided that amount plus the tips received equals at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. If an employee's tips combined with the employer's direct wages do not equal the minimum wage, the employer must make up the difference. Employers also are required to provide employees notice of the FLSA tip credit provisions, to maintain accurate time and payroll records and to comply with the hours, hazardous orders and other restrictions applying to workers under age 18. For more information about the FLSA and other federal wage laws, call the Wage and Hour Division's toll-free helpline at 866-4US-WAGE (487-9243).

"March 4, 2014",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20140378,OPA News Release: US Department of Labor releases fiscal year 2015 budget request [03/04/2014],"WASHINGTON — U.S. Secretary of Labor Thomas E. Perez today released the president's fiscal year 2015 budget for the Department of Labor, which supports the president's plan to further grow the economy and create more jobs in America. ""In his State of the Union address, President Obama said that we are all united as Americans by the belief we share in 'opportunity for all,' the notion that if you work hard and take responsibility, you can make it in America. This budget request works to ensure that Americans have the skills they need for the in-demand jobs of today and tomorrow, and also protects the health, safety and retirement savings of workers,"" said Secretary Perez. The fiscal year 2015 president's budget for the Department of Labor includes $11.8 billion in discretionary funding, along with new, dedicated mandatory funds. The budget includes funding and reforms that will better prepare workers for jobs; protect their wages, working conditions and safety; provide a safety net for those who lose their jobs or are hurt on the job; and promote secure retirements. While the budget adheres to the spending levels agreed to in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, it also illustrates the president's vision for an economy that promotes opportunity for all Americans with a fully paid for Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative. The budget supports reforms to improve training and employment programs to help workers gain skills and return to work more quickly. It proposes to streamline access to federal job training programs, more fully engage employers to ensure training is directed at ready-to-fill-jobs in the marketplace, and improve the efficiency and employment outcomes of the department's programs. The budget proposes the creation of the New Careers Pathways program, which would provide job assistance to a million Americans and combine the best features of the Trade Adjustment Assistance for Workers program and the Workforce Investment Act Dislocated Workers program. The New Careers Pathways program, to be administered by the Employment and Training Administration, delivers on the Obama administration's vision to offer one set of services to displaced workers through one unified system. The budget also creates additional jobs and careers by catalyzing new partnerships between community colleges and employers. The Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative includes $1.5 billion in 2015 to support a four-year, $6 billion Community College Job-Driven Training Fund to launch new training programs and apprenticeships that will prepare participants for in-demand jobs and careers. Of each year's funding, $500 million will be set aside for grants to create new apprenticeships and increase participation in existing apprenticeship programs. This four-year investment will support doubling the number of apprenticeships in America over the next five years. To foster innovation and better performance, the budget includes $60 million for the Workforce Innovation Fund to give states and regions the flexibility to test new workforce development strategies. It provides $80 million for Incentive Grants to reward states that have been successful in training and placing in jobs those with the greatest barriers to employment. The budget also proposes $15 million for grants to states, consortia of states, or regional partnerships to develop employment and training strategies targeted to particular in-demand industry sectors in regional economies. To reach the nation's long-term unemployed, the 2015 budget proposes mandatory funding for a Job-Driven Training for Youth and the Long-Term Unemployed initiative made up of programs to allow individuals to continue receiving Unemployment Insurance benefits while participating in short-term work placements. It also supports partnerships between businesses, education and training providers to train approximately one million long-term unemployed. Funding for a Summer Jobs Plus program is also included to create summer and year-round employment opportunities for 600,000 disadvantaged youth. For those who have lost their jobs, the budget invests $158 million in re-employment and eligibility assessments and re-employment services, an evidence-based approach to speed the return to work of UI beneficiaries. The funds will serve those who are most likely to exhaust their UI benefits as well as all returning military service members. In addition, the budget proposal includes needed reforms to the UI program to enhance the system's solvency and financial integrity while maintaining benefits for job seekers. The budget also supports the extension of emergency unemployment benefits for the long-term unemployed. If not extended, 3.6 million additional people are estimated to lose access to extended UI benefits by the end of 2014, remaining unemployed and looking for work. The budget includes substantial investments in the department's worker protection agencies to bolster their enforcement of the laws that protect the health, safety, wages, working conditions and retirement security of American workers. The budget includes: An increase of more than $41 million for the Wage and Hour Division to ensure workers receive appropriate wages and overtime pay, as well the right to take job-protected leave for family and medical leave purposes. Nearly $14 million to combat the misclassification of workers as independent contractors, which deprives them of benefits and protections to which they are legally entitled and disadvantages employers who comply with the law. $5 million for the creation of a State Paid Leave Fund to assist workers who need to take time off to care for a child or other family member, with another $100 million proposed as part of the Opportunity, Growth and Security Initiative. Substantial investments in worker safety, including $565 million for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to foster employer compliance with safety and health regulations and inspect hazardous workplaces, and strengthen its protection of whistleblowers against retaliation for reporting unsafe and unscrupulous practices. The budget also includes $377 million for the Mine Safety and Health Administration to help protect workers in one of our nation's most dangerous industries. $107 million for the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, which enforces equal employment opportunity at federal contractors. The budget includes $1.1 million to strengthen efforts to eliminate pay discrimination affecting women who earn significantly less than their male counterparts for comparable work and to secure equal treatment for all workers. The budget includes two additional important reforms. One initiative, estimated to save $20 billion over the next decade, would encourage companies to fully fund their pension benefits by authorizing the Board of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation to adjust premiums and take into account the risks that different retirement plan sponsors pose to their retirees. Another reform would act on longstanding Government Accountability Office and Inspector General recommendations to improve and update the Federal Employees Compensation Act program.

Main updated union members on recent actions taken by the Mine Safety and Health Administration to improve mine safety and health. The USW is the largest industrial union in North America, and it represents workers from a number of industries, including metals and mining. ""The progress made by MSHA and the mining industry as a whole have shown that greater improvements are achievable,"" said Main. Among the initiatives launched by the agency in the past year that Main discussed was the development of a comprehensive miners' representative handbook (link is external) and Web-based training course (link is external) . The handbook is available electronically and in hard copy. The agency has enhanced the education and training and investigative components of its workers' rights program (link is external) , held outreach meetings to present information on miners' rights and distributed resource materials throughout the mining industry. In 2013, 45 discrimination cases were filed with MSHA, the most ever, along with 26 temporary reinstatement cases, the second highest number on record. In his remarks, Main stated that mine safety has been on a steady path of improvement since the agency began implementing reforms, characterized by a reduction in the number of chronic violators and better compliance with mine safety and health standards. Most importantly, during this period, the industry achieved the lowest fatality and injury rates in the history of mining in 2011 and again in 2012, a trend that continued through FY 2013. Main also noted that, in the past year, MSHA has: completed dozens of actions (link is external) based on recommendations identified by the internal review of the 2010 Upper Big Branch mine disaster (link is external) ; implemented new criteria for mine rescue team certification (link is external) ; reformed coal, metal and nonmetal mine rescue training contests (link is external) ; significantly reduced the backlog of cases pending before the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission (link is external) and improved overall consistency in enforcement activities."

""This corporate-wide settlement agreement will have a far-reaching effect and impact on correctional officers and other staff nationwide,"" said Teresa A. Harrison, OSHA's acting regional administrator in Atlanta. ""This agreement is the first of its kind in the corrections industry that addresses the hazards associated with workplace violence."" In June 2012, the department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration cited the company for workplace safety violations at a prison facility it managed in Meridian, Miss. These violations included a willful violation for the company's failure to: provide adequate staffing of correctional officers; fix malfunctioning cell door locks; and provide required training and personal protective equipment to protect employees from incidents of violent behavior by inmates, including stabbings, bites and other injuries. The company contested the citation to the Occupational Safety & Health Review Commission (link is external) . Under the three-year agreement, the willful citation has been reclassified as a serious violation and the company will pay a $13,600 fine. Additionally, the company is required to hire a third-party consultant to develop and maintain a workplace violence prevention program and conduct onsite workplace violence safety audits at each of the 42 correctional and adult detention facilities that it manages across the country. They will also need to create a corporate-level workplace violence coordinator position and develop a workplace safety committee at each of these facilities.

And while we are on site, our inspectors will collect more complete data about the job and what happened. This information will help OSHA to more fully understand and prevent these tragedies. Our inspectors will also be paying close attention to contracts and sub contracts to determine who is doing tower work and what their qualifications are. And we will be taking a hard look at the safety requirements that flow down through the contracts and how owners and contractors ensure that everyone involved meets those requirements.

""Establishing an employee rotation schedule to prevent prolonged exposure to heat, developing specific emergency and first aid procedures, and maintaining an awareness of certain medications and medical conditions that increase the risk of heat-related illness are a few measures employers can implement to prepare for and handle heat-related incidents,"" added Levy.

Frank Kousaie was sole shareholder of the company. From Feb. 28, 2007, to at least Nov. 16, 2011, Kousaie and the company withheld money from the paychecks of employees as contributions to the plan, but failed to segregate and remit all contributions to the employee benefit plan. The contributions were commingled with the general assets of the company and used for general operating expenses. Furthermore, the company and Kousaie failed to maintain a fidelity bond to protect plan assets and to maintain accurate records of employer contributions allegedly made by the company in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Kousaie’s debt to the plan, including lost opportunity cost, is estimated to be $12,793. As of Dec. 31, 2009, the plan held over $150,000.00 in assets. Resolution: The complaint seeks an order requiring the defendants to restore to the plan all losses, including lost opportunity costs, resulting from fiduciary breaches; permanently enjoining them from serving as fiduciaries to any ERISA-covered plan; appointing an independent fiduciary to distribute the plan’s assets and terminate the plan. The suit also seeks to require the plan to set off from Kousaie’s individual account the amount of losses resulting from his fiduciary breaches and to disgorge any profits received as a result of the prohibited transactions in which they engaged. The department has also filed a complaint against Kousaie to prevent his liability to the plan from being discharged under a bankruptcy petition he filed with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of Ohio, on Oct. 18, 2013, Case No. 13-53034-mss.

Following one of the U.S. Department of Labor's largest tipped employee investigations in recent years, the company and its owner, Peter Ciarrocchi, Jr., have agreed to pay $6,842,412 to 1,159 employees at nine of the company's locations, plus a $50,000 civil money penalty. The proposed consent judgment has been filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and is subject to the review and approval by the court. ""The egregious actions by Chickie's & Pete's harmed real people and violated the promise that a fair day's work deserves a fair day's pay,"" said U.S. Secretary of Labor Thomas E. Perez. ""Restaurant servers are among the lowest paid workers in this country, with many earning incomes below the poverty line. Tipped workers deserve better and this action shows that the Department of Labor is ready to stand up for them."" Under the Fair Labor Standards Act, tips are the property of the employee who receives them; however, restaurant operators can benefit by claiming a credit based on the tips towards their obligation to pay those employees the full minimum wage. If an employee's tips combined with the employer's direct wages do not equal the minimum wage, the employer must make up the difference during the pay period. An employer that claims a tip credit is required to pay a tipped employee only $2.13 an hour in direct wages provided that amount plus the tips received equals at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. The federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour was last increased in 2009 and the federal tip credit's cash wage requirement of $2.13 has not been increased since 1991. ""When employers exploit tipped workers, they not only harm their employees who are working hard to earn a living, but also take advantage of the trust of their customers,"" said Laura Fortman, principal deputy administrator for the department's Wage and Hour Division. ""Customers might not realize it, but their tips frequently are paying part of their servers' wages, not just giving them a little extra to go with their pay. Chickie's and Pete's behavior is troubling because they both unlawfully took tips from their workers and failed to pay them even the $2.13 per hour the law requires when an employer takes a tip credit."" Investigators from the Wage and Hour Division's Philadelphia and Southern New Jersey offices conducted investigations at locations in Northeast Philadelphia, South Philadelphia, Philadelphia International Airport, Parx Casino in Bensalem, Pa., Warrington, Pa., Drexel Hill, Pa., Audubon, Pa., Egg Harbor Township, N.J., and Bordentown, N.J. Investigators found that the company improperly retained a fixed portion of the tips servers received from customers. The investigation disclosed that the company required servers to contribute a portion of their tips to an improper ""tip pool,"" or tip-sharing arrangement, which was approximately between 2 percent and 4 percent of the server's daily table sales. The owner illegally retained approximately 60 percent of the tip pool. This amount had come to be known as ""Pete's Tax"" and was required to be paid to the manager in cash at the end of each shift, even if the server received all tips on credit cards and therefore did not have cash on hand. In some cases, the company required employees to use their own money to contribute to this pool by withdrawing cash from a nearby ATM or borrowing from another server. Additionally, servers and bartenders were paid only a flat rate of $15 per shift at all locations except for Chickie's and Pete's airport establishment  an amount that was not sufficient in all cases to even cover the minimum cash wage of $2.13 per hour that must be paid to a tipped employee when an employer claims a tip credit under federal law. Additionally, the employer failed to pay the required overtime wages to these employees when they worked in excess of 40 hours in a week. Investigators also determined that employees were not paid for time spent in mandatory meetings and training, and were improperly required to pay for uniforms. Under the provisions of the consent judgment filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, and subject to court approval, the company will pay minimum wage and overtime back wages and is required to return the improperly retained tips to the servers, as well as pay liquidated damages. In addition, the company has agreed to enhanced compliance, including: External compliance monitoring for an 18-month period; Internal compliance monitoring for an additional 18-month period; Training for all employees on their rights under the FLSA; Providing a statement to any employee required to contribute to a tip pool detailing the amounts that were contributed by the employee, the job categories of workers included in the tip pool and the specific percentage each category receives; and Peter Ciarrocchi, Jr., will write an article for a restaurant trade publication that addresses an employer's obligations under the FLSA. The consent judgment also calls for Chickie's & Pete's and Ciarrocchi to be permanently enjoined and restrained from violating the provisions of the FLSA in the future. The FLSA requires that covered, nonexempt employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour for all hours worked, plus time and one-half their regular rates of pay for hours worked beyond 40 per week.

""This is a common sense measure that helps workers access employer-sponsored health insurance while providing employers flexibility,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Employee Benefits Security Phyllis C. Borzi. The final regulations require that no group health plan or group health insurance issuer impose a waiting period that exceeds 90 days after an employee is otherwise eligible for coverage. The rules do not require coverage be offered to any particular individual or class of individuals. To ensure that eligibility conditions based solely on the passage of time are not used to evade the waiting period limit, the rules state that such conditions cannot exceed 90 days. Other conditions for eligibility are generally permissible, such as meeting certain sales goals, earning a certain level of commission, or successfully completing an orientation period. Additionally, requiring employees to complete a certain number of hours before becoming eligible for coverage is generally allowed as long as the requirement is capped at 1200 hours. The rules also address situations in which it cannot be determined that a new employee will be working full-time. The departments are issuing a companion proposed rule that would limit the maximum duration of an otherwise permissible orientation period to one month. This proposal will be open for public comment. Both the final and proposed rules will be published in the Feb. 24, 2014 edition of the Federal Register and can also be viewed at the links below.

OSHA started its inspection following a complaint regarding hazardous working conditions at the company's manufacturing facility in Homerville. Proposed penalties total $279,400. ""Since 2007, this employer has known about the dangers of a lack of machine guarding and exposure to electric shock, but repeatedly puts workers at risk of serious injury or death,"" said Robert Vazzi, OSHA's area director in Savannah. ""Earning a paycheck should not involve being in an unsafe work environment."" Dupont Yard manufactures posts for agricultural projects and highway construction and produces timber and wood chips. In the past six years, 39 violations have been cited in four previous inspections. The current inspection found three willful safety violations, carrying $171,600 in penalties. OSHA found that workers were exposed to hazards from the company's failure to implement basic safety procedures that would prevent equipment from starting up or moving during maintenance, which can cause amputation, other serious injuries or death. Additionally, there were caught-in and crushing hazards from unguarded rotating chains and sprocket wheels, as well as electrical hazards. A willful violation is one committed with intentional, knowing or voluntary disregard for the law's requirements, or with plain indifference to worker safety and health. Due to the willful violations found at the site, the company has been placed in OSHA's Severe Violator Enforcement Program (link is external) , which mandates targeted follow-up inspections to ensure compliance with the law. Under the program, OSHA may inspect any of the employer's facilities or job sites. Two repeat violations, carrying penalties of $30,030, are associated with inspections in March 2008 and January 2011. The company lacked proper housekeeping and failed to close electrical panels, risking electric shock hazards. A repeat violation exists when an employer previously has been cited for the same or a similar violation of a standard, regulation, rule or order at any facility in federal enforcement states within the last five years. Workers also were exposed to 17 serious safety and health violations, with $77,770 in penalties. Many relate to failing to implement a lockout/tagout program properly, including not providing workers with training and locks for equipment before maintenance operations. Accumulated wood dust greater than 1/8 inch was also found on ledges and electrical equipment. The current citations can be viewed at http://www.osha.gov/ooc/citations/dupontyardinc_931983_02-18-2014.pdf .

The Ready to Work Partnership (link is external) grant competition will support and scale innovative partnerships between employers, nonprofit organizations and America's public workforce system to build a pipeline of talented U.S. workers and help those experiencing long-term unemployment gain access to employment services that provide opportunities to return to work in middle- and high-skill jobs. Approximately 20 to 30 grants ranging from $3 million to $10 million will be awarded to programs focused on employer engagement, individualized counseling, job placement assistance, and work-based training that facilitate hiring for jobs where employers currently use foreign workers on H-1B visas. ""These grants are part of President Obama's call to action to help ensure that America continues to be a magnet for middle-class jobs and business investment,"" said U.S. Secretary of Labor Thomas E. Perez. ""We need to do everything we can to help employers expand and grow while at the same time remembering that those who have been out of work through no fault of their own deserve a fair shot."" Secretary Perez made the grant announcement from the Pulaski, N.Y., headquarters of the Fulton Companies (link is external) , a global manufacturer of industrial and commercial heating systems. Thanks in part to federal funding from the multi-agency Advanced Manufacturing Jobs and Innovation Accelerator Challenge (link is external) , Fulton develop strong training partnerships with the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry, the Manufacturers Association of Central New York, and the Syracuse Center of Excellence in Environmental and Energy Systems. Together, they were able to develop the local workforce Fulton needed to expand the manufacturing capacity of their Pulaski plant to better serve the North American and overseas markets. Programs funded through Ready to Work Partnership grants will use on-the-job training, paid work experience, paid internships and Registered Apprenticeships (link is external) to provide employers the opportunity to train workers in the specific skill sets required for open jobs. Programs will have to recruit those who have been out of work for six months or longer and will incorporate a strong up-front assessment, allowing for a customization of services and training to facilitate re-employment. As a pre-condition to be considered for funding, at least three employers or a regional industry association must be actively engaged in the project. The grants are financed by a user fee paid by employers to bring foreign workers into the United States under the H-1B nonimmigrant visa program (link is external) .

An investigation by the U.S. Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division found that the company violated the minimum wage and overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act at the company's six locations across central Pennsylvania. ""Cheung Enterprises not only failed to properly pay its employees, it willfully took advantage of vulnerable student workers living and working in our country under the J-1 visa program,"" said Al Gristina, director of the division's Wilkes-Barre District Office, which conducted the investigation. ""This agreement will ensure that the rights and wages of both U.S. workers and student guest workers are protected."" Investigators from the division's Wilkes-Barre District Office found Cheung Enterprises made improper deductions from employee paychecks, bringing the rate of pay for some employees below the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. The firm failed to pay student workers properly. Other employees did not receive the overtime premium required by the FLSA. Investigators determined that the company charged the student workers excessive rent that was deducted from their paychecks for substandard, employer-owned housing. In addition to paying back wages and liquidated damages, Cheung Enterprises and Andrew Cheung agreed to pay a $5,000 civil money penalty for the willful nature of the violations and will comply with the FLSA overtime and record-keeping provisions in the future. Cheung no longer operates any McDonald's franchises. The FLSA requires that covered, nonexempt employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, as well as one and one-half times their regular rates for every hour they work beyond 40 per week. The law also requires employers to maintain accurate records of employees' wages, hours and other conditions of employment, and prohibits employers from retaliating against employees who exercise their rights under the law. The FLSA provides that employers who violate the law are generally liable to employees for their back wages and an equal amount in liquidated damages, which are paid directly to the affected employees.

The light curtain that would have automatically turned the machine off before he entered the danger zone had been disabled. Proper operation of the machine's guards, a basic Occupational Safety and Health Administration requirement (link is external) , would have saved his life. Today, following its investigation of the incident and inspection of the worksite, OSHA cited Wire Mesh Sales LLC for eight per-instance willful violations as well as a number of other repeat, serious and other-than-serious citations. Proposed penalties total $697,700. The company has been put into OSHA's Severe Violator Enforcement Program (link is external) , which focuses resources on inspecting employers who have demonstrated indifference to their legal obligations by committing willful, repeated or failure-to-abate violations. ""This was a preventable and senseless tragedy,"" said U.S. Secretary of Labor Thomas E. Perez. ""When employers are serious about safety, everyone benefits. Wire Mesh Sales LLC failed to properly implement OSHA safety regulations, and a worker paid the ultimate price."" The per-instance willful citations include the employer's failure to guard the wire mesh manufacturing machine as well as three other large machines that make wire mesh or straighten and test the wire. Additionally, the company failed to assure that four machines, including the one involved in the incident, were shut down and hazardous sources of energy were locked or tagged out prior to employees' entering and servicing the equipment where no guards protected them from harm. The 56 employees, most of who were not native English speakers and who worked 12-hour shifts seven days per week, were exposed to serious injury or death because of these failures. OSHA proposes $560,000 in fines for the eight per-instance willful violations. A willful violation is one committed with intentional knowing or voluntary disregard for the law's requirements, or with plain indifference to worker safety and health. A total of 22 serious violations allege a variety of conditions, including: a factory floor cluttered with broken pallets creating a hazard that could lead to workers tripping and falling into moving machine parts; an electrical outlet left on the ground wrapped in tape that posed a shock hazard; and a bathroom with a sink that had been clogged for months with maggots swimming in standing water. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known. Fines for the serious violations total $126,700. Wire Mesh was also cited for a repeat violation for failing to administer an effective hearing conservation program. The company violated this standard at its Oglesby, Ill., facility in 2012. A repeat violation exists when an employer previously has been cited for the same or similar violation of a standard, regulation, rule or order at any facility in federal enforcement states within the last five years. There are $11,000 in proposed fines for the repeat violation. Finally, the company was cited for four other-than-serious safety and health violations for failing to: mark exits, assure crane operation safety and develop an effective respirator program for employees required to wear respirators. An other-than-serious violation is one that has a direct relationship to job safety and health, but probably would not cause death or serious injury. View all of the citations in this case. (link is external) Wire Mesh has more than 200 employees nationwide, and recorded $60 million in revenue in 2012.

""The employer put workers at risk of serious injury or death by not protecting them from fire, explosion and other hazards,"" said Joseph Roesler, OSHA's area director in Mobile. ""These deficiencies must be corrected immediately."" Workers faced amputation, laceration and caught-in hazards and were exposed to excessive noise over the permissible limit. Twelve serious violations were cited, including the employer's failure to ensure protection from fire/explosion hazards where PVC piping was used to transport compressed air; reduce compressed air for cleaning to less than 30-pounds-per-square inch; and label and provide training on hazardous chemicals. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known. Three other-than-serious violations include failing to develop a respiratory protection program and an assessment of personal protective equipment.

Joy Process Mechanical Inc. of East Syracuse and M. Hubbard Construction Inc. of Mottville were hired by the plant to replace piping inside a methane gas dome, a confined space. The Joy Process Mechanical worker was welding inside the dome when the explosion occurred, burning him and a Hubbard Construction worker who was standing atop a stepladder opening to the confined space. ""This tragedy could have been prevented had basic safety precautions been implemented,"" said Christopher Adams, OSHA's area director in Syracuse. ""Confined spaces and hazardous atmospheres pose dangerous risks to workers. Employers must provide the equipment and safeguards that prevent workers from getting hurt."" Investigators from OSHA's Syracuse Area Office found that both employers failed to ensure safeguards and to train workers on the hazards associated with methane gas and confined spaces. Workers were not provided with a meter to measure the presence of combustible gas. The confined space also lacked adequate ventilation and a retrieval system for swift exits in an emergency. Hubbard Construction was also cited for ladder misuse and for using electrical equipment that had not been rated safe in a hazardous atmosphere. As a result, Joy Process Mechanical was issued three serious citations with $14,700 in proposed fines. Hubbard Construction was issued seven serious citations with $31,020 in fines. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known.

In April 2009, defendant Gail Garrow terminated the IAQ Inc. 401(k) plan and requested that the plan’s fund custodian, John Hancock, transfer the plan’s assets totaling approximately $211,334 into an operating account maintained by IAQ. Upon IAQ receiving the transfer of the plan’s assets, as directed by Garrow, the plan’s assets were placed in the IAQ operating account and commingled with IAQ’s general assets. On or about the date of the transfer there were 45 participants in the plan. During the course of its investigation, the U.S. Department of Labor’s Employee Benefits Security Administration learned that defendants Garrow and IAQ distributed $74,125 of the plan’s assets to five plan participants. The account balances of the remaining 40 participants were not distributed and remained in the operating account of IAQ. Resolution: In the consent judgment and order, the court appointed Jeanne Bryant of Brentwood, Tenn., as the plan’s independent fiduciary for the purpose of terminating the plan and distributing $155,332.77, its remaining assets and lost earnings.

The next day, a cell phone tower collapsed in Clarksburg, W.Va. Minutes later a second tower at the same Clarksburg site also fell. The collapse of these two towers resulted in the deaths of two workers and a firefighter responding to the scene, and sent two other employees to the hospital with serious injuries. As a result, the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration is collaborating with the National Association of Tower Erectors (link is external) and other industry stakeholders to ensure that every communication tower employer understands their responsibility to protect workers performing this high-hazard work. ""Tower worker deaths cannot be the price we pay for increased wireless communication,"" said Dr. David Michaels, assistant secretary of labor for occupational safety and health. ""Employers and cell tower owners and operators must do everything possible to stop these senseless, preventable tragedies."" OSHA is concerned about the alarming increase in preventable injuries and fatalities at communication tower worksites. In 2013, thirteen fatalities occurred in this industry, more than in the previous two years combined. This disturbing trend appears to be continuing, with the four worker deaths occurring in the first five weeks of 2014. In an effort to prevent these tragic incidents, OSHA is increasing its focus on tower safety. Today, the agency has sent a letter to communication tower employers (link is external) urging compliance and strict adherence to safety standards and common sense practices. OSHA has created a new Web page targeting the issues surrounding communication tower work, which is available at https://www.osha.gov/doc/topics/communicationtower/index.html (link is external) . This outreach follows a November 2013 memo to OSHA's compliance officers and regional administrators (link is external) mandating increased attention, education and data collection on the industry. Of the 13 communication tower-related fatalities that occurred in 2013, the majority were a result of falls. OSHA requires employers to provide adequate fall protection equipment, train employees how to use the safety equipment and ensure that they use it properly and consistently. In the past few months, tower workers have also been injured or killed by falling objects, the structural collapse of towers and equipment failures. For example, OSHA issued citations in December 2013 to Custom Tower LLC of Scott, La., for one willful violation following the death of a worker who fell approximately 125 feet. OSHA is committed to working with the communications industry to prevent these injuries and fatalities, and it will continue outreach and enforcement efforts to make sure that communication tower workers are adequately protected.

Also at the announcement were representatives of the construction companies making these hiring commitments, veterans who have completed apprenticeships in the construction industry, and other leaders in the field. In an op-ed running in this morning's Wall Street Journal, the First Lady writes: ""Today, more than 100 American construction companies came together to announce that they plan to hire more than 100,000 veterans within the next five years. They made this commitment not just because it's the patriotic thing to do, and not just because they want to repay our veterans for their service to our country, but because they know that it's the smart thing to do for their business."" ""All men and women who have sacrificed for our country in our armed services deserve opportunities for good jobs worthy of their character and their achievements,"" said Secretary Perez. ""The Department of Labor will do whatever it takes to help our veterans translate their skills and leadership into jobs, and I am inspired by the commitment displayed today by the construction industry and all our partners in helping to achieve that mission."" The construction industry is expected to grow rapidly in the coming years — outpacing the steady growth of the economy as a whole and helping to strengthen local communities. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that construction is one of the fastest-growing industries in the nation, with job growth of more than 1.5 million jobs between now and 2022 — an annual growth rate of 2.6 percent. Construction companies large and small — from national firms like Jacobs and Bechtel, to regional firms like Cianbro Construction, to local contractors and subcontractors across America — are stepping up to ensure their industry welcomes home the nation's heroes with good-paying jobs. More than 80 additional companies are committing their existing training and employment programs to fill new construction jobs with veterans. The construction industry was represented at the announcement by executives of several participating companies, with Larry L. Melton, project executive for Bechtel and Marine Corps veteran delivering remarks. ""Veterans are invaluable to the construction industry. Men and women who serve in the military often have the traits that are so critical to our success: agility, discipline, integrity, and the drive to get the job done right,"" Melton said. ""Bechtel is passionate about supporting veterans and we continue to expand our efforts to hire transitioning military members."" Lori Sundberg, senior vice president of human resources at Jacobs also stated: ""We are pleased to support programs that provide career opportunities for our military veterans.

The department filed the lawsuit against The Ohio Bell Telephone Company, which operates as AT&T, on behalf of 13 employees who received unpaid suspensions after reporting work place injuries from 2011 to 2013. ""It is against the law for employers to discipline or suspend employees for reporting injuries,"" said Dr. David Michaels, assistant secretary of labor for occupational safety and health. ""AT&T must understand that by discouraging workers from reporting injuries, it increases the likelihood of more workers being injured in the future. And the Labor Department will do everything in its power to prevent this type of retaliation."" The complaint alleges that in 13 separate incidents, employees of AT&T were disciplined and given one- to three-day unpaid suspensions for reporting injuries that occurred on the job. The company alleged that each employee violated a corporate workplace safety standard; however, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's investigation found that the suspensions were a result of workers reporting their injuries. Five of the employees in the suit are based in Columbus; two in Brooklyn Heights; two in Canton; and one each in Akron, Cleveland, Gallipolis and Uhrichsville. The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, Eastern Division, alleges the company violated the whistleblower provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. The department's Regional Office of the Solicitor in Cleveland is litigating the case. OSHA enforces the whistleblower provisions of 22 statutes protecting employees who report violations of various airline, commercial motor carrier, consumer product, environmental, financial reform, food safety, motor vehicle safety, health care reform, nuclear, pipeline, public transportation agency, railroad, maritime and securities laws. Employers are prohibited from retaliating against employees who raise concerns or provide information to their employer or the government under any of these laws.

January was the 47th consecutive month of private-sector job growth, with 8.5 million new jobs over that period. The unemployment rate (6.6 percent) maintained its downward trend, reaching its lowest level since October 2008. Manufacturing continued to rebound and has now generated 93,000 jobs over the last six months. Construction experienced its largest month-to-month job growth since March 2007. The labor force participation rate inched upward by .2 percent. ""But President Obama isn't satisfied with a modest recovery. In his State of the Union address ten days ago, he laid out an agenda that would quicken the pace of economic growth and job creation, an agenda based on the principle of opportunity for all. Through hard work, anyone should be able to succeed in America, to realize their dreams and secure a foothold in the middle class. ""To restore the promise of opportunity, the president has offered concrete proposals on everything from preschool education to infrastructure investments to retirement security. He is committed to making sure our skills and training programs prepare people for good jobs.

The STC program (link is external) allows employers to reduce work hours for a group of employees as an alternative to layoffs during tough economic times. With STC, workers affected by reduced hours have their lowered wages supplemented by a percentage of the weekly unemployment compensation available to them. This is a win-win program: employees keep their jobs — and benefits — while employers maintain their skilled workforce and avoid having to hire and train new workers when business activity increases again. This approach eases the strain on local economies, which acutely feel the impact of layoffs. ""Innovative programs like short-time compensation will help to keep businesses in Washington competitive and agile while providing an extra layer of financial security for workers during challenging economic periods,"" said U.S. Secretary of Labor Thomas E Perez. ""I encourage every state to take advantage of the available federal incentives to develop or expand STC programs nationwide."" Of the funds awarded, Washington will allocate $708,445 for enhancements to the STC program, while the remaining $1,428,304 will go toward educating the public about the advantages of incorporating an STC program and increasing enrollment of employers into the program. This funding was made available through the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 (link is external) , which gave the secretary of labor authority to award grants to states to implement or improve an STC program, as well as promote the program and enroll employers. States with an STC program may also be eligible to receive 100 percent reimbursement from the federal government for STC benefits paid.

OSHA proposed $75,483 in penalties following a July 2013 inspection initiated under its Site-Specific Targeting Program that directs enforcement resources to workplaces with the highest injury and illness rates. ""The Site-Specific Targeting Program allows us to be proactive in identifying workplace hazards before an accident can occur,"" said Jean Kulp, director of OSHA's Allentown Area Office. ""Each of the cited violations leaves Philadelphia Macaroni workers open to risks and needs to be fixed immediately."" The repeat violations, with a $60,490 penalty, were due to electrical hazards, including the improper use of electrical equipment, blocked electrical panels and an opening in electric boxes, cabinets and fittings; a deficient emergency eyewash system; and use of an improperly configured guard designed to protect workers from lacerations while working with a band saw. The company was cited for similar violations in November 2008 . A repeat violation exists when an employer previously has been cited for the same or a similar violation of a standard, regulation, rule or order at any other facility in federal enforcement states within the last five years. Eight serious violations, carrying a $14,993 penalty, include deficiencies in the company's program for controlling hazardous energy and electrical hazards. These hazards include exposed live parts operating above 50 volts and the use of a damaged flexible cord. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known. Philadelphia Macaroni has 37 workers at this facility. The company has 15 business days from receipt of the citations and proposed penalties to comply, request a conference with OSHA's area director in Allentown, or contest the findings before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. To ask questions, obtain compliance assistance, file a complaint, or report workplace hospitalizations, fatalities or situations posing imminent danger to workers, the public should call OSHA's toll-free hotline at 800-321-OSHA (6742) or the agency's Allentown Area Office at 267-429-7542.

An inspection of the Bristol wire products manufacturer began on July 23, 2013, under OSHA's Site Specific Targeting Program, resulting in $109,340 in proposed fines. ""The sizable fines proposed here reflect the breadth and gravity of these hazards and the fact that this employer has been cited previously for several of these conditions,"" said Warren Simpson, OSHA's area director in Hartford. ""Left uncorrected, plant employees are exposed to hazards, such as electric shock, arc flashes, fire, eye and crushing injuries. It's imperative that employers not just correct hazards, but effectively prevent their recurrence."" Inspectors at the 97 Ronzo Road plant found similar violations to those cited in October 2009, including failing to train maintenance personnel on the practices of using the personal protective equipment required for protection against electric shock, arc flashes or arc blasts while trouble-shooting or working on live electrical equipment; use fixed wiring, rather than extension cords, to power equipment and prevent blocked access to an electrical disconnect; provide designated workers with annual hands-on fire extinguisher training; and review the hazardous energy control program annually to prevent machine startup during maintenance. These violations resulted in $53,900 in proposed fines. A repeat violation exists when an employer previously has been cited for the same or a similar violation of a standard, regulation, rule or order at any other facility in federal enforcement states within the last five years.

"January 30, 2014",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20140130,"WHD News Release: US Department of Labor secures more than $250,000 in back wages for student workers with disabilities in Providence, R.I. [01/30/2014]","PROVIDENCE, R.I. — The City of Providence, the Providence School Board and the Harold A. Birch Vocational Center and School have signed a settlement agreement to pay $250,859 in back wages to 60 student workers with disabilities following an investigation by the U.S. Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division that found violations of the minimum wage provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act. As part of the settlement agreement the department has retroactively revoked the certificate that allowed the school to pay the workers less than the current federal minimum wage for the work performed. ""This settlement is the result of a strategic enforcement initiative to protect workers with disabilities from exploitation,"" said David R. Gerrain, acting district director of the Wage and Hour Division's Hartford office. ""Workers with disabilities deserve an opportunity to do meaningful work and to receive an income. Although employers may legally pay such workers below the current federal minimum wage, the law clearly states that they may only do so when they assure compliance with certain, key conditions."" ""We applaud the U.S. Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division for its efforts to enforce the Fair Labor Standards Act to protect individuals with disabilities from exploitation and abuse. This agreement brings valuable compensation to students who, because of their disabilities, were deprived of appropriate wages, segregated from their peers, and denied the opportunity to prepare for work in real jobs,"" said Eve Hill, deputy assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice. ""This compensation is an important step towards independence, economic self-sufficiency, and full community participation for these students."" Specifically, the department found that Birch Vocational School failed to determine the prevailing wage rates for workers performing similar work in the area, failed to determine the appropriate sub-minimum wage to be paid to each worker as allowed under Section 14(c) of the FLSA, failed to maintain proper records, and failed to properly pay employees in accordance with the Act. Rather than calculate and pay wages commensurate with workers' individual levels of productivity, as required under the terms of a certificate, the employer in this case paid workers flat rates of $1- $2.01 per day, without regard to the number of hours they had worked or to how much they had produced. The company also falsified time-study documents that are necessary to calculate legitimate rates of pay. Student employees were paid sporadically, sometimes going for weeks at a time between paychecks. Birch ceased operation of its work center as of April 12, 2013. While employed by the work center, students performed work assembling, packing and sorting of goods by hand. The FLSA, in general, requires that covered, non-exempt employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 for all hours worked, plus time and one-half their regular rates of pay, including commissions, bonuses and incentive pay, for hours worked beyond 40 per workweek. However, since its enactment in 1938, the FLSA has contained provisions designed to promote employment opportunities for individuals with disabilities. Section 14(c) of the act allows employers, after receiving a certificate of authorization from the division, to pay wages less than the federal minimum wage to workers with disabilities when their disabilities impair their productive capacities for the work being performed. The division has been pursuing strategies to strengthen compliance with Section 14(c) and maximize the impact of its benefits for workers with disabilities, their employers, families and communities. These strategies include using all available enforcement tools to remedy and deter future violations; providing new compliance assistance materials and tools; and hosting new compliance conferences for employers, community rehabilitation programs, advocates, workers and other interested parties. The Wage and Hour Division issued a retroactive revocation of the certificate authorizing Birch to pay sub-minimum wages between June 1, 2010, and June 1, 2013, during which time the school was operating in violation of the law. As a result, all FLSA-covered employees performing work for Birch during that time period are owed no less than the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour for all hours worked. The agreement signed by the parties waives any right to appeal this revocation. The employer has further agreed not to pursue another certificate in the future. This resolution comes just months after the department announced the revocation of authorization for Training Through Placement, Inc., based in North Providence, to pay disabled workers less than the federal minimum wage. That investigation disclosed that the program at Birch served as the point of origin for many people entering the program at TTP. In June the Justice Department also announced that it had entered into an interim settlement agreement with Rhode Island and the city to resolve violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act for approximately 200 state residents with intellectual and developmental disabilities who performed work for TTP and the Harold A. Birch Vocational Center and School. The investigation was conducted by the division's district office in Hartford, Conn. Legal support was provided by Attorney Nathan Goldstein of the department's New England Regional Office of the Solicitor.

""This employer failed to train workers and implement safeguards that could have protected them from excessive heat conditions. Workers were also exposed to potentially fatal injuries from falls, electrocution and unguarded operating machine parts."" On July 19, 2013, the worker, who later suffered from heat illness and died, had been working for several hours on a conveyor line, sorting and recycling construction and demolition waste. Workers were exposed to excessive ambient heat stemming from environmental sources and the heat generated by recycling machinery. OSHA's investigation found that the company failed to inform and train workers on the recognition, prevention and treatment of heat-related illnesses and did not provide temperature controls in the work area or implement a work/rest regimen. A feasible and acceptable means of addressing excessive heat includes, but is not limited to, establishing a heat stress management program containing training, procedures for heat acclimatization and what to do in emergencies. OSHA found workers exposed to falls of 20 to 40 feet due to unguarded wall openings, missing guardrails and lack of fall protection equipment; electrocution hazards from an ungrounded electrical outlet and power cord; and lacerations and amputations from unguarded grinders. As a result, eight serious citations were issued. The citations can be viewed at http://www.osha.gov/ooc/citations/CooperTankHealth.pdf and http://www.osha.gov/ooc/citations/CooperTankSafety.pdf . A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known. For more information about protecting workers from heat stress, visit http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/heatstress/index.html and http://www.osha.gov/Publications/osha-niosh-heat-illness-infosheet.pdf .

It is available for download, in English and Spanish, on Android-based platforms and the iPhone at http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/heatillness/heat_index/heat_app.html . The company, which faces $40,500 in fines, has 15 business days from receipt of the citations and penalties to comply, request an informal conference with OSHA's area director, or contest the findings before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.

"January 29, 2014",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20140146,MSHA News Release: MSHA announces results of December impact inspections [01/29/2014],"ARLINGTON, Va. — The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration today announced that federal inspectors issued 135 citations, 24 orders and one safeguard during special impact inspections conducted at 11 coal mines and two metal and nonmetal mines in December. The monthly inspections, which began in force in April 2010 following the explosion at the Upper Big Branch Mine, involve mines that merit increased agency attention and enforcement due to their poor compliance history or particular compliance concerns. The inspection details of two mines are listed below: On Dec. 11, MSHA conducted an impact inspection during the day shift at Hanover Resources LLC's Caymus Mine in Boone County, W.Va. The inspection party monitored the mine's communication system to prevent advance notice of their arrival, and they proceeded to inspect the mine's two working sections and a large portion of the conveyor belt. MSHA issued seven 104(d)(2) unwarrantable failure orders (link is external) and six 104(a) citations (link is external) . This is the first impact inspection at this mine. Inspectors found that the operator failed to follow the approved ventilation plan that required line curtains to be installed and maintained in idle faces. Inspectors found inadequate airflow, and in some areas, inspectors were unable to measure any air movement. The required line curtains were either rolled up, not hung to the mine floor or placed in the wrong locations. Inspectors also determined that the mine's ventilation system was disrupted, so belt air was flowing into the working section instead of away from it. The mine operator's failure to follow the approved plan created conditions that exposed miners to the risk of black lung and mine explosions. Inspectors also observed accumulations of combustible material consisting of fine coal dust in various locations of a working section. The mine operator did not provide the required hand-held, multigas detector to two crews of miners and an examiner working on the belt and section. Additional violations included an area of unsupported roof without warning markers, failure to apply rock dust after a belt move and the use of wrong sprays on a continuous mining machine. The methane monitor on a continuous mining machine was not in proper working condition. Hazardous conditions that were obvious and extensive were not recorded in the preshift examination book and not corrected, and the operator permitted miners to work in these areas. MSHA conducted an impact inspection at the Veris Gold U.S.A. Inc.'s Jerritt Canyon Mill in Elko County, Nev., that began on Dec. 16. Inspectors issued 61 citations and orders to the mine operator. Among the hazardous conditions cited during the inspection, MSHA found that an electrician working in the crusher area had been cleaning and performing maintenance on a 480-volt fully-energized switch gear, and there were spent mercury containers found at the bottom of wet mill stairs rather than being stored in a manner that would protect miners from mercury exposure. Nearly four feet of dirt had accumulated on the left side of a conveyor belt, blocking access to the steps and catwalk used to reach the plant and potentially hindering escape during an emergency. Inspectors also found: a chemical container improperly labeled; no warning signs for hazardous chemical storage; several unsecured gas cylinders; no provision for safe access in several locations; missing electrical cover plates on energized outlets; an improperly grounded cable; unlabeled breakers that exposed miners to electrical hazards; a broken ladder and insufficient illumination; failure to conduct workplace exams and air receiver tanks equipped with the wrong size pressure relief valves, creating the potential hazard of an exploding vessel. ""These two examples clearly indicate that some mine operators still don't get it,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""They simply failed to comply with the Mine Act (link is external) and find and fix hazards to protect miners from injury, illness and death."" Since April 2010, MSHA has conducted 700 impact inspections and issued 11,562 citations, 1,076 orders and 49 safeguards.

"January 28, 2014",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20140128,WHD News Release: Federal judge orders garnishment of unpaid back wages and damages from Tazewell County accounting firm and president [01/28/2014],"BLUEFIELD, Va. — U.S. Magistrate Judge Pamela Meade Sargent ordered the garnishment of an additional $5,002 in liquidated damages from the Tazewell County accounting firm of Raymond A. Froy Jr., CPA, P.C., and its president, Raymond A. Froy Jr., after ruling that the defendants failed to meet the terms of a consent judgment with the U.S. Department of Labor. ""Employers face legal consequences when they fail to comply with the terms of consent judgments,"" said John DuMont, director of the division's Pittsburgh District Office, which conducted the investigation. ""Compliance with labor laws matters, and we will use all enforcement tools available to ensure employers abide by the law."" Under the terms of the Jan. 11, 2013, consent judgment, which resolved a lawsuit filed by the department that alleged violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act, the accounting firm agreed to pay $17,003 in back wages and liquidated damages to six employees by Feb. 1, 2013. The consent judgment stipulated that, if the terms of the agreement were not met, the firm would become liable for an additional $5,002 in liquidated damages. Because the employer chose not to pay the full amount he agreed to pay, the judge ordered the garnishment of the additional liquidated damages and remaining unpaid back wages, bringing the total to $22,005. Investigators from the division's Pittsburgh District Office found the firm violated the FLSA's minimum wage, overtime and record-keeping provisions by paying tax preparers straight-time wages for all hours worked, rather than time and one-half their regular rates of pay for hours worked beyond 40 per week. The employer also failed to pay two employees at least the federal minimum wage; did not record dates of birth for minor employees; and failed to make, keep and preserve adequate and accurate records of employees' wages, hours and other conditions of employment. On Aug. 27, 2013, the court issued a Writ of Continuing Garnishment to National Bank directed at the accounts of the defendants for the amount that remained due to the department under the consent agreement. Froy filed an Objection to Garnishment on Sept. 15, which the judge overruled on Nov. 25. The judge ruled that the defendants did not present any claim or evidence that the property held by National Bank was subject to a valid claim of exemption, or that the department failed to comply with the statutory requirements for the issuance of the Writ of Garnishment. The court found that there was no good cause for setting aside the terms of the consent judgment. The FLSA requires that covered, nonexempt employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 for all hours worked, plus time and one-half their regular rates, including commissions, bonuses and incentive pay, for hours worked beyond 40 per week. Earnings may be determined on a piece-rate, salary, commission or some other basis, but in all such cases, the overtime pay due must be computed using the employee's average hourly rate. Employers are also required to maintain accurate time and payroll records. The FLSA provides that employers who violate the law are liable to employees for their back wages and, as a general rule, an equal amount in liquidated damages. Back wages and liquidated damages are paid directly to the affected employees.

OSHA conducted its inspection as part of the agency's regional emphasis program for falls in construction. Proposed penalties total $59,290. ""The Roof Authority continues to disregard the safety of its workers by not addressing known hazards,"" said Condell Eastmond, OSHA's area director in Fort Lauderdale. ""Management must take immediate action to correct these deficiencies."" The willful citation, with $53,900 in penalties, involves the employer exposing workers to a fall hazard because the workers removed roofing materials without fall protection. A willful violation is one committed with intentional, knowing or voluntary disregard for the law's requirements, or with plain indifference to worker safety and health. The serious violation, with $5,390 in penalties, involves the employer exposing workers to a struck-by hazard. The workers were close to a crane operating with an outrigger pad that had sunken into the ground due to insufficient support materials. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known. OSHA's fall prevention campaign provides employers and workers with lifesaving information and educational materials about working safely from ladders, scaffolds and roofs. It was developed in partnership with the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health and NIOSH's National Occupational Research Agenda program. More information on fall protection standards is available in English and Spanish at http://www.osha.gov/stopfalls . The Roof Authority is a residential, industrial, commercial and condominium roofing company. The company has 15 business days from receipt of the citations and proposed penalties to comply, request a conference with OSHA's area director, or contest the findings before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. To ask questions, obtain compliance assistance, file a complaint, or report workplace hospitalizations, fatalities or situations posing imminent danger to workers, the public should call OSHA's toll-free hotline at 800-321-OSHA (6742) or the agency's Fort Lauderdale Area Office at 954-424-0242. Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. OSHA's role is to ensure these conditions for America's working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education and assistance.

"January 27, 2014",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20140113,EBSA News Release: US Labor Department and Securities and Exchange Commission reach combined $21M in settlements with Western Asset Management [01/27/2014],"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Labor today announced a settlement with Western Asset Management Company, a subsidiary of Legg Mason Inc. This follows investigations, which revealed the purchase of prohibited securities that resulted in losses to the accounts of nearly 100 employee benefit plans and investment funds holding plan assets. The settlement also resolves findings that the company engaged in prohibited cross-trading of securities in the accounts of other retirement plans and funds, which caused additional losses. The settlement was achieved in coordination with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The settlement and related SEC charges require Western Asset to restore a total of more than $17.4 million to employee benefit plans and other accounts and require the company to pay more than $3.6 million in penalties. ""Workers invest too much in retirement plans to have them diminished by the very people they trust to grow their savings,"" said U.S. Secretary of Labor Thomas E. Perez. ""The department is committed to protecting retirement savings so that more of America's workers have the opportunity to build nest eggs and live securely when they retire."" The investigation found that from Jan. 31, 2007, through June 12, 2009, Western Asset used funds from accounts covered by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (link is external) to purchase approximately $90 million of securities that were prohibited for purchase and ownership by such accounts. Specifically, Western Asset purchased Glen Meadow Pass-Through Trust Securities for 99 ERISA-covered accounts that were under its management. The investigation determined that the company's own compliance system recognized that the terms of the securities prohibited their ownership by ERISA-covered entities. However, Western Asset overrode the system, allowing the accounts to improperly purchase and hold the securities in their portfolios. The department determined that the company's management and compliance personnel became aware of the issue by October 2008, but failed to immediately correct the error or inform their clients about the situation. This violated the company's own policies. The accounts continued to hold the prohibited securities until June 2009, at which time they were sold, resulting in significant losses. The department's investigation also found that from 2007 through 2010, Western Asset arranged 514 cross-trades involving ERISA-covered accounts. Western Asset sold fixed-income securities from client accounts, including ERISA-covered accounts to various broker-dealers. The company then repurchased the same securities from the same broker-dealers on behalf of different clients at a mark-up and without obtaining independent offers. Cross-trade transactions are prohibited by ERISA, except under certain circumstances, to protect employee benefit plans from an investment manager's conflicts of interest. The department's investigation determined that as a result of unfair pricing involving these cross-trades, certain ERISA-covered accounts suffered more than $6 million in losses. ""Western Asset violated its fiduciary duty to act solely in the best interest of its plan clients,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Employee Benefits Security Phyllis C. Borzi. ""Its failure to follow not only the law, but its own rules, cost hard-working employees millions of dollars."" Western Asset is headquartered in Pasadena. Its clients include numerous ERISA-covered employee benefit plans. This case was investigated by the regional office of the Employee Benefits Security Administration in Los Angeles, in coordination with the SEC's Los Angeles Regional Office and New York Regional Office.

Perez on the Bureau of Labor Statistics' 2013 Union Membership Report [01/24/2014],"WASHINGTON — U.S. Secretary of Labor Thomas E. Perez has issued the following statement regarding the department's Bureau of Labor Statistics report (link is external) released today on union membership in 2013: ""Today the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced that, in 2013, the unionization rate of employed wage and salary workers was 11.3 percent. Among private-sector employees, the rate was 6.7 percent. ""The data also show that among full-time wage and salary workers, union members have higher median weekly earnings than nonunion workers. The median weekly earnings of union members were $950, compared to $750 for nonunion workers. ""Along with higher wages, other data show that union members have greater access to employment-based benefits, such as health insurance, a retirement savings plan, and sick and vacation leave. ""Workers' ability to form unions and engage in collective bargaining has been a cornerstone of a strong middle class. The decline in union membership over the last few decades has contributed to more working families struggling to get by. When workers have a seat at the table, they are better able to bargain for their fair share of the value they helped create; and that leads to greater economic security and economic mobility for everyone. As our economy continues to recover and we work to create good jobs, we need to ensure workers can lift their voices to raise wages, reduce inequality and help more people climb ladders of opportunity."""

Employees Profit Sharing Retirement Plan in Syracuse, NY","Date of Action: Jan. 21, 2014 Type of Action: Consent order and judgment Defendants: Darryl J. Grandy and the Syracuse Lithographing Co. Employees Profit Sharing Retirement Plan Allegations: Darryl J. Grandy was an officer, director and shareholder of Syracuse Lithographing and was a fiduciary and the designated trustee for the Syracuse Lithographing Co. Employees Profit Sharing Retirement Plan. Between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2011, Grandy failed to timely remit employee contributions and loan repayments into the plan, causing lost earnings of at least $2,013.00. During that same time period, Grandy withheld employees’ contributions from their wages but failed to deposit at least $20,062.00 in employee’s contributions and loan repayments. The plan currently has 12 participants and $328,000 in assets. On Oct. 23, 2013, the department filed a lawsuit seeking an order requiring Grandy to restore all losses plus interest and/or lost opportunity earnings incurred by the plan; removal of Grandy as plan trustee; provision of all books, documents and records relating to the finance and administration of the company and the plan to the department; the permanent enjoinment of Grandy from serving as a plan trustee and future ERISA violations; and appointment of an independent fiduciary for the plan. Resolution: The consent judgment requires Grandy to restore to the plan $20,063.63 in withheld employee contributions plus $2,625 in lost opportunity costs. Once the funds are fully restored, Grandy will distribute them to the participants, and then terminate the plan. Upon the plan’s termination, Grandy will be permanently prohibited from serving as a fiduciary or service provider to any employee benefit plan covered under Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act.

OSHA initiated the July 2013 inspection after receiving a complaint alleging safety and health hazards. Proposed penalties total $228,600. ""This employer willfully disregarded worker safety by exposing workers to amputation hazards,"" said Brian Sturtecky, OSHA's area director in Jacksonville, Fla. ""The hazards found during our inspection must be eliminated from this workplace immediately."" Three willful violations, with $162,000 in penalties, involve the employer exposing workers to amputations hazards by not providing machine guarding on the hand-fed ripsaws, the cutting heads of the routers and the abrasive wheels on the grinding wheel. A willful violation is one committed with intentional knowing or voluntary disregard for the law's requirements, or with plain indifference to worker safety and health. Eighteen serious safety and health violations, with $66,600 in penalties, include failing to: provide workers first aid training in case of an emergency; provide a suitable eyewash facility; close unused openings in boxes, raceways, cabinets and equipment cases; have uniform step heights on a standard stairway and keep exit routes unobstructed. Workers were also exposed to numerous instances where the machines had no guarding, several electrical deficiencies were present and various tripping hazards were observed. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known. Four other-than-serious violations were also cited for the company's failure to: illuminate exit signs; certify forklift operators as competent to operate powered industrial trucks safely; establish a respiratory protection program; and have forklift nameplates and markings in place and in legible condition. No monetary penalties were assigned for these violations. An other-than-serious violation is one that has a direct relationship to job safety and health, but probably would not cause death or serious physical harm. The citations can be viewed at http://www.osha.gov/ooc/citations/Teen_Challenge_of_Florida_922044_0121_14.pdf Teen Challenge of Florida in Pensacola offers assistance to adults ages 18 and older who are struggling with drug addiction, alcoholism and other life-controlling issues. The company has 15 business days from receipt of the citations and proposed penalties to comply, request a conference with OSHA's area director or contest the findings before the independent Occupational Safety & Health Review Commission (link is external) . To ask questions, obtain compliance assistance; file a complaint or report workplace hospitalizations, fatalities or situations posing imminent danger to workers, the public should call OSHA's toll-free hotline at 800-321-OSHA (6742) or the agency's Jacksonville Area Office at 904-232-2895. Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 , employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees.

Inc., doing business as AAF International, with two repeat, five serious and one other-than-serious safety violation following an inspection of the company's manufacturing facility on Weaver Way in Atlanta. The inspection, prompted by a complaint, began in August 2013. It resulted in $64,040 in proposed penalties. ""This employer continues to place its workers in jeopardy of serious injury or death by not correcting previously identified hazards,"" said William Fulcher, director of OSHA's Atlanta-East Area Office. ""Management must make safety the first priority and address these hazards immediately."" The repeat violations, with $39,000 in penalties, involve exposing workers to shock and burn hazards from unused openings in electrical boxes and failing to use electrical equipment according to manufacturer guidelines. A repeat violation exists when an employer previously has been cited for the same or a similar violation of a standard, regulation, rule or order at any facility in federal enforcement states within the last five years. Similar violations were cited in 2009. The serious safety violations, with $25,040 in penalties, include the employer's failure to provide temporary workers performing cleaning operations with lockout/tagout training; ensure abrasion protection on electrical wires entering the electrical panel for the conveyor system; and to provide strain relief for the strip feeder and speed control boxes. Additionally, workers were exposed to struck-by and caught-in hazards while cleaning the conveyor, and to shock and burn hazards from live wiring. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known. The other-than-serious violation, with no monetary penalty, involves failing to inspect the specific energy control procedures periodically. An other-than-serious violation is one that has a direct relationship to job safety and health, but probably would not cause death or serious physical harm. American Air Filter Co.

"January 22, 2014",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20140097,EBSA News Release: $10M settlement reached with People Care and US Labor Department [01/22/2014],"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Labor today announced a $10 million settlement agreement with People Care Holdings Inc. and former owners Bruce Jacobson and Jerry Lewkowitz, who sold the company to their employees through creation of an employee stock ownership plan. The department contended that they violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (link is external) by permitting the ESOP to purchase People Care stock from them for more than its fair market value. An investigation by the Employee Benefits Security Administration's New York Regional Office found Jacobson, Lewkowitz and People Care breached their fiduciary duties by failing to correct unrealistically optimistic projections of People Care's future earnings and profitability, even after People Care lost a key municipal contract. The investigation also found that the stock purchase agreement's indemnification provision was invalid because it would require People Care, which is entirely owned by the ESOP, to pay any costs incurred by Jacobson and Lewkowitz in connection with an investigation or litigation. ""Owners who sell their companies to their employees and benefit from ESOP tax treatments are responsible for ensuring that the terms are fair to the plan and its participants,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Employee Benefits Security Phyllis C. Borzi. ""They have a duty to monitor the independent trustees that they appoint to oversee the transaction."" Under the terms of the settlement agreement, Jacobson and Lewkowitz will pay $9,090,910 to the ESOP and a civil penalty of $909,090. People Care is a home-care agency, based in Manhattan, that provides caregiving services, such as meal preparation, laundry, shopping, housekeeping, companionship and medication assistance. Its ESOP has approximately 4,655 ERISA-covered plan participants. It has facilities in New York and New Jersey.

"January 16, 2014",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20140116,"WHD News Release: US Labor Department enforcement initiative results in more than $170,000 in back wages for more than 600 child care workers in Kentucky [01/16/2014]","LOUISVILLE, Ky. — An ongoing enforcement initiative conducted by the U.S. Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division focusing on the child care industry in Kentucky has uncovered significant violations of the minimum wage, overtime and record-keeping provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act. In fiscal year 2013, the division's Louisville District Office conducted 59 cases involving child care providers, resulting in more than $170,000 in back wages for more than 600 workers. ""Our ongoing initiative in Kentucky seeks to remedy widespread labor violations, ensure compliance among employers previously found in violation of the FLSA and promote compliance throughout the child care industry. It is important that workers in this industry are paid their rightful wages and treated with respect, so they, in turn, can provide quality child care service to Kentucky's working families,"" said Karen Garnett, director of the Wage and Hour Division's Louisville District Office. ""The department is seeking compliance commitments from employers to prevent future labor violations and ensure lasting industrywide compliance."" Common violations found include employers failing to count time spent when employees attend mandatory training courses as compensable; improperly classifying FLSA-covered employees as exempt from receiving overtime compensation; making illegal deductions from employees' wages that resulted in earnings falling below the federal minimum wage; paying employees straight-time wages rather than time and one-half their regular rates of pay for hours worked over 40 in a workweek; missed payrolls that resulted in additional minimum wage and overtime violations; and failing to maintain the required record keeping. Wage and Hour investigators continue to make unannounced visits to child care service providers throughout Kentucky, including franchises, enterprises with multiple locations and facilities operating under a state license. Investigations include thorough inspections of payroll records and employment practices, as well as employee interviews, to ensure compliance with all applicable labor standards. In addition to enforcement efforts, the division is conducting outreach to workers, employee associations, community organizations, state and local agencies and other stakeholders to inform them of the ongoing initiative and encourage their participation in promoting industrywide compliance. The division is continuing to provide compliance assistance and education to employers, industry associations and state licensing agencies on all applicable regulations, and will continue the initiative this year. The child care industry employs many low-wage workers who, due to a lack of knowledge of the law or hesitance to exercise their rights, are vulnerable to disparate treatment and labor violations. The FLSA requires that covered employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 for all hours worked, plus time and one-half their regular rates, including commissions, bonuses and incentive pay, for hours worked beyond 40 per week. Additionally, employers must maintain accurate time and payroll records. The division's Louisville District Office can be reached at 502-582-5226. Information on the FLSA and other wage laws is available by calling the division's toll-free helpline at 866-4US-WAGE (487-9243) or by visiting http://www.dol.gov/whd/ ."

Jochims and Robert C. Jochims Allegations: The U.S. Department of Labor has filed suit against Stephanie J. Jochims, the former owner of Western Steel Erection, Inc., and her husband Robert C. Jochims, in an effort to recover $5,167 in employee retirement contributions and loan repayments intended for the Western Steel Erection 401(k) Plan. The company was located in Long Lake, Minn. An investigation by the Labor Department's Employee Benefits Security Administration revealed that the defendants, as co-trustees of the company's 401(k) plan, failed to forward employee retirement contributions and loan repayments during the months leading up to the company's closure in February 2010. The Department's lawsuit alleges that the Jochims violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act by retaining the contributions in the company's account and using them for non-plan purposes. The lawsuit also alleges the Jochims failed to properly terminate the plan, causing the participants to incur unnecessary fees and costs. Resolution: The Labor Department seeks a court order requiring the restoration of all plan losses and barring the Jochims from serving as a fiduciaries or service providers to any employee benefit plan. The Labor Department also seeks to have an independent fiduciary appointed to distribute the plan's remaining assets to the participants.

Zohouri Allegations: In 2005, now defunct Zohouri Group LLC, formerly a real estate mortgage broker based in Alpharetta, Ga., established a 401(k) plan for its employees. In May 2008, Zohouri Group ceased operations. When it ceased operations, the defendants failed to administer the plan and ensure that the funds in the plan were appropriately distributed to participants, leaving participants in the plan unable to receive information about their retirement benefits and unable to gain access to their retirement benefits. During the course of an investigation by the U.S. Department of Labor's Employee Benefits Security Administration, the agency learned that the abandoned plan had 22 participants with retirement benefits totaling approximately $47,000. The plan funds were held by State Street Bank and Trust Co. of Boston, Mass. State Street was unable to distribute the plan's retirement benefits without authorization from the defendants. Resolution: In the default judgment and order, the court appointed Jeanne Bryant, of Brentwood, Tenn., to be the plan's independent fiduciary for the purpose of terminating the plan and distributing its assets. The order also permanently enjoined Zohouri Group from acting as a fiduciary to any employee benefit plan subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act .

The materials include fact books, self-assessments and best practice guides. ""These new materials can help prevent hospital worker injuries and improve patient safety, while reducing costs,"" said Dr. David Michaels, assistant secretary of labor for occupational safety and health. ""At the heart of these materials are the lessons from high-performing hospitals that have implemented best practices to reduce workplace injuries while also improving patient safety."" ""By fostering research to identify injury risk factors and safety interventions, steps can be taken to save costs and enhance service to the patients,"" said Dr. John Howard (link is external) , director of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (link is external) . The website's materials on safe patient handling are designed to address the most common type of injuries hospital workers face, and hospitals can use these resources to protect their workers, improve patient safety and reduce costs. Hospital workers face serious hazards, including: lifting and moving patients, workplace violence, slips and falls, exposure to chemicals and hazardous drugs, exposures to infectious diseases and needlesticks. In 2012, U.S. hospitals recorded 250,000 work-related injuries and illnesses, almost 60,000 of which caused employees to miss work. Nationwide, workers' compensation losses result in a total annual expense of $2 billion for hospitals. Michaels was joined on a call announcing the resources by Howard, Dr. Lucian Leape (link is external) , chairman of the Lucian Leape Institute at the National Patient Safety Foundation (link is external) , and Dr. Erin S. DuPree (link is external) , chief medical officer and vice president of the Joint Commission Center for Transforming Healthcare (link is external) .

Va., where 12 miners died in a massive explosion Jan. 2, 2006. The commission found that the mine operator's failure to notify MSHA and mine rescue teams immediately after the explosion involved unwarrantable failure and high negligence. ""Although eight years have passed, the memories of that tragic day have not diminished,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""We are grateful for the commission's decision in this case reaffirming the importance of immediate reporting of mine accidents."" Although the explosion occurred at 6:26 a.m. EST, MSHA was not contacted until 7:50 a.m., and efforts to reach a mine rescue team member at his home did not take place until 8:04 a.m. Consequently, MSHA issued a citation and order to the mine operator for failure to: immediately notify the agency of the explosion, comply with the mine's emergency evacuation and firefighting program, and immediately contact the mine rescue team. Feldman concluded that commission case law permitted the operator a reasonable opportunity to investigate the event prior to being required to contact authorities. He also reasoned that the operator's negligence in not immediately reporting the incident was mitigated by mine management's wish to execute a rescue attempt and to not be barred from entering the mine. Feldman also took into account the fact that the event occurred on Jan. 2 (when the national holiday for New Year's Day was being observed) since Jan. 1 fell on a Sunday that year, so MSHA and state offices were closed, making it difficult to reach authorities. On appeal, a two-member commission majority held, in agreement with MSHA, that the ALJ erred because he: (1) miscalculated the time at which the mine operator's duty to report commenced; (2) treated the intentional nature of the operator's failure to report as a mitigating factor; (3) treated the fact that the explosion occurred on a federal holiday as a mitigating factor; and (4) failed to consider the fact that, when the operator finally attempted to report the explosion, it relied solely on an off-site management official who had limited knowledge of the explosion and limited information and resources available to him at home. In addition to reinstating MSHA's unwarrantable failure and high negligence designations, the commission assessed the company with MSHA's proposed penalties of $1,500 and $13,000 for two separate citations. ""The operator's intention to assist underground personnel during this emergency, while admirable, is exactly the type of conduct that the [Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977] and the Secretary's regulations are intended to address and avoid,"" wrote the commission majority.

The company, along with its President, William A. Langenhuizen; Vice President, William H. Langenhuizen; Secretary Treasurer, Antoinette Langenhuizen; Vice President, Robert Langehuizen; and Vice President of Finance, Lisa Kulak, have been debarred from eligibility for further service contracts with any U.S. government agency for three years for their failure to pay drivers required fringe benefits. ""Contractors that do business with the federal government have an obligation to abide by the law and pay their employees the required contractual rates and benefits,"" said U.S. Secretary of Labor Thomas E. Perez. ""Restoring the pension benefits of these workers and debarring this employer illustrate the department's commitment to vigorous enforcement of government contracting laws and helps level the playing field for law-abiding employers."" Wage and Hour investigators found that Lange Trucking failed to fully fund the drivers' 401(k) plan, resulting in a violation of the SCA. Wage and Hour has investigated the company several times in the past. Lange Trucking paid $500,000 of the unpaid benefits while Hoovestol Inc., which is based in Eagan, Minn., acquired the company subsequent to the violations and voluntarily agreed to fund the remaining $1.48 million in benefits. Hoovestol, which cooperated fully with the Wage and Hour Division during its investigation, has also: corrected record-keeping procedures, overhauled the plan to ensure timely payments into the plan going forward, posted wage determinations at the work site and made information about the contracts accessible to employees. The SCA applies to every contract entered into by the United States or the District of Columbia, the principal purpose of which is to furnish services in the United States through the use of service employees. The SCA requires that contractors and subcontractors performing services on covered federal contracts in excess of $2,500 must pay their service workers no less than the wages and fringe benefits prevailing in the locality. The investigation was conducted by the division's district office in San Francisco. The consent findings were filed by the department's Regional Office of the Solicitor in San Francisco.

That report examined the agency's actions in the months leading up to the April 2010 Upper Big Branch mine explosion, which killed 29 miners, injured two and led to sweeping changes in mine safety. ""The internal review was designed to identify shortcomings so that we, as an agency, could take necessary actions to improve mine safety and health,"" said Joseph A.

""The result was one of the most comprehensive internal reviews in MSHA history, and the most extensive improvements at the agency in decades."" In June 2012, MSHA began posting on its website quarterly updates of the corrective actions (link is external) that had been completed. The agency, however, did not wait for the internal review team to publish its findings and put in place a number of administrative, organizational and regulatory reforms in the immediate aftermath of the tragedy. These reforms included: enhanced enforcement programs, such as impact inspections and a revised pattern of violations process (link is external) ; the splitting of the southern West Virginia coal district into two districts; the upgrading of the Mt. Hope, W.

""MSHA was able to maintain the schedule throughout the process and finish corrective actions on time, which is a testament to the hard work and dedication of our employees."" Among the corrective actions MSHA put into place: Revision or development of more than 40 policy directives, including the significant revision of mine inspection procedure handbooks (link is external) and the development of a new coal roof control handbook (link is external) More than 20 separate training sessions for MSHA personnel on issues raised by the internal review Creation of a centralized system to establish better oversight of all agency directives and policy guidance and to ensure their consistency Modification of the Mine Plan Approval database system Integration of a common tracking system to track inspector re-training Creation (with the Holmes Safety Association and mining community) of a national mine rescue organization (link is external) to support and provide guidance on mine rescue ""The Upper Big Branch tragedy unquestionably shook the very foundation of mine safety,"" said Main.

"January 13, 2014",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20140045,MSHA News Release: MSHA implements Upper Big Branch corrective actions on schedule [01/13/2014],"ARLINGTON, Va. — The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration announced today that, as of Dec. 31, 2013, the agency had addressed the 100 recommendations published in a March 2012 internal review report (link is external) , meeting the specific timetables and deadlines it had set for implementation of each recommendation. That report examined the agency's actions in the months leading up to the April 2010 Upper Big Branch mine explosion, which killed 29 miners, injured two and led to sweeping changes in mine safety. ""The internal review was designed to identify shortcomings so that we, as an agency, could take necessary actions to improve mine safety and health,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""The result was one of the most comprehensive internal reviews in MSHA history, and the most extensive improvements at the agency in decades."" In June 2012, MSHA began posting on its website quarterly updates of the corrective actions (link is external) that had been completed. The agency, however, did not wait for the internal review team to publish its findings and put in place a number of administrative, organizational and regulatory reforms in the immediate aftermath of the tragedy. These reforms included: enhanced enforcement programs, such as impact inspections and a revised pattern of violations process (link is external) ; the splitting of the southern West Virginia coal district into two districts; the upgrading of the Mt. Hope, W. Va., laboratory for better coal dust and gas analyses; reorganization of the Office of Assessments, Accountability, Special Enforcement and Investigations (link is external) to better manage and support MSHA's enforcement programs; and publication of final regulations on the maintenance of rock dust (link is external) , examinations in underground mines (link is external) and the pattern of violations (link is external) program to rein in chronic violators. ""Meeting the self-imposed timelines was a major challenge,"" said Main, pointing to other demands facing the agency, such as mission-critical needs, sequestration and the 16-day government shutdown. ""MSHA was able to maintain the schedule throughout the process and finish corrective actions on time, which is a testament to the hard work and dedication of our employees."" Among the corrective actions MSHA put into place: Revision or development of more than 40 policy directives, including the significant revision of mine inspection procedure handbooks (link is external) and the development of a new coal roof control handbook (link is external) More than 20 separate training sessions for MSHA personnel on issues raised by the internal review Creation of a centralized system to establish better oversight of all agency directives and policy guidance and to ensure their consistency Modification of the Mine Plan Approval database system Integration of a common tracking system to track inspector re-training Creation (with the Holmes Safety Association and mining community) of a national mine rescue organization (link is external) to support and provide guidance on mine rescue ""The Upper Big Branch tragedy unquestionably shook the very foundation of mine safety,"" said Main. ""It caused us to re-double our efforts to instill a culture of prevention in mining.

"January 10, 2014",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20140047,OPA News Release: Statement of Labor Secretary Perez on December employment numbers [01/10/2014],"WASHINGTON — Secretary of Labor Thomas E. Perez issued the following statement about the December 2013 Employment Situation report released today: ""The U.S. economy closed out 2013 by adding 74,000 jobs, bringing the 2013 total to nearly 2.2 million new jobs. With 87,000 new private-sector jobs in December, that makes 8.2 million jobs created by the private sector over the last 46 straight months. The December unemployment rate fell to 6.7 percent. ""The economy continues to recover, but we are clearly not out of the woods. Far too many Americans are still struggling to find jobs and secure a foothold in the middle class. Long-term unemployment in particular remains a persistent challenge, stuck at a staggering high: 3.9 million Americans, representing 37.7 percent of all unemployed workers, have been unemployed for at least 27 weeks. ""I've met recently with many of them — hard-working Americans who, despite their most diligent efforts, have just been unable to find work, some for as long as a few years. Their lives are a daily struggle, as they rapidly deplete their savings and face looming foreclosure on their homes. One woman described keeping her thermostat at 58 degrees, wearing a coat and hat around the house, to cut back on heating costs. They are not lazy or complacent; they want nothing more than the dignity of work. But they're caught in a terrifying spiral: the longer you've been out of a job, the harder it is to get a job. ""To give them the immediate relief they so badly need, the first order of business for Congress is to pass an extension of emergency unemployment benefits that expired on Dec. 28 for 1.3 million people. It's the right thing to do to extend a lifeline to fellow Americans down on their luck, and it's the smart thing to do to stimulate the economy. ""But we need to go beyond stopgap measures. The best way to help unemployed Americans is to create jobs and grow the economy at a faster clip. Last month's bipartisan budget deal demonstrated that members of Congress can muster the will to agree on constructive solutions to tough problems. In that same spirit, they must now get to work on the middle-class jobs agenda put forward by President Obama. Let's resolve in the New Year to fix our broken immigration system, invest in education and skills development, rebuild our infrastructure, increase the minimum wage and take other steps to create and expand opportunity for the American people."""

According to the settlement, which was approved by Kenneth R. Andrews, the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission (link is external) administrative law judge assigned to the case, Nyrstar Gordonsville agreed to pay back wages, front pay and compensatory damages to two miners who were terminated from their jobs at the underground zinc mine, Elmwood/Gordonsville Mine. In addition, the mine operator is required to pay civil penalties totaling $22,000 for its alleged violations of Section 105(c) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 . ""All miners have the right to identify hazardous conditions and refuse unsafe work without fear of discrimination or retaliation,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""Judge Andrews' decision will help ensure that the workers at these two mines fully understand their rights."" The department's complaint alleged that the miners were terminated after engaging in various forms of protected activity during the first half of 2012, including: making safety complaints to immediate supervisors, the mine's safety department and senior managers; making internal complaints of retaliation to the mine's human resources department and, subsequently, to corporate headquarters; registering with MSHA as a designated representative of miners; assisting MSHA during inspections; being suspected of making hazard complaints to MSHA; filing a prior complaint of retaliation with MSHA; opposing retaliation taken against another miner; and engaging in protected communications with a representative of miners. Under the terms of this agreement, the company is required to read the settlement to all miners working at the Elmwood/Gordonsville and Cumberland mines and keep a notice, which is a copy of the settlement, posted in those mines for nine months. The notice informs the miners of specific rights they have under the Mine Act and advises them of their right to contact MSHA in order to make a complaint of retaliation if they believe those rights have been violated. According to Section 105(c) of the Mine Act, a miner cannot be discharged, discriminated against or interfered with in the exercise of statutory rights because he or she has engaged in a protected activity, such as filing a complaint alleging a health or safety violation, or refusing to work under unsafe or unhealthy conditions.

From August 2009 to the present, Robert Zanetti failed to take appropriate measures to collect and forward to the plan $16,066 in fringe benefits contributions plus $1,600 in interest. During this same period the company and Robert Zanetti failed to file the plan's Form 5500 annual report with the U.S. Department of Labor, provide plan participants with the summary plan description and annual updates and maintain a fidelity bond to protect the plan. Resolution: The complaint asks the court to: require the defendants to restore to the plan any and all losses incurred as a result of their breaches of their fiduciary duties and violations, plus interest; require the defendants to make appropriate allocations and disbursements to each of the plan's participants whose accounts were underfunded and then terminate the plan; and permanently enjoin the defendants from future ERISA violations.

Perez on extending unemployment benefits [01/07/2014],"WASHINGTON — U.S. Secretary of Labor Thomas E. Perez today issued the following statement regarding the Senate's procedural vote invoking cloture on a three-month extension of Emergency Unemployment Compensation: ""Today, the U.S. Senate threw a lifeline that 1.3 million Americans desperately need, agreeing to move forward on legislation to extend emergency unemployment benefits that had expired on Dec. 28. ""Although the economy is slowly healing, too many people are still weathering a powerful, devastating storm they did nothing to create. Through no fault of their own and despite their most diligent efforts, so many workers have been unable to find jobs. Many face catastrophic situations, in danger of losing their homes and unable to support their families. ""Extended unemployment benefits, even as the economy continues to rebound, is a proud bipartisan tradition. This version of the program was first passed by a Republican Congress and signed by President Bush in 2008. Failure to extend these benefits at a moment when long-term unemployment is this high would be historically unprecedented. ""Today's Senate vote was the right thing to do–an important step toward providing critical relief to families in economic distress. And it was also the smart thing to do–because these benefits would provide an economic stimulus by putting more money in the pockets of working families. ""I am grateful in particular to Senators Reed and Heller, as well as Majority Leader Reid, for their leadership in moving this legislation. It is critical now that the Senate move quickly to final passage, with the House of Representatives following suit and getting a bill to President Obama's desk as soon as possible."" # # # Editor's Note : More information on the estimated impacts state-by-state of Emergency Unemployment Compensation benefits not being extended is available in the Americans Suffer After Failure to Extend Emergency Unemployment Benefits blog post.

The monthly inspections, which began in force in April 2010 following the explosion at the Upper Big Branch Mine, involve mines that merit increased agency attention and enforcement due to their poor compliance history or particular compliance concerns. The inspection details of two mines are listed below: On Jan. 2, MSHA conducted an impact inspection during the evening shift at Baylor Mining Inc.'s Beckley Crystal Mine located in Raleigh County, W.Va. Twelve enforcement actions were issued, including one unwarrantable failure citation, four unwarrantable failure orders and one 104(b) order (link is external) for failure to abate a hazardous condition in a timely manner. This impact inspection was the first one conducted at this mine. After arriving on mine property, two MSHA inspection personnel secured mine communications, and the inspection party split up to travel to the working section and a belt segment. Their inspection included producing sections and belt conveyers, and they traveled the intake air course and alternate escapeway. During the inspection of the belt conveyor, a 104(d)(1) citation (link is external) was issued for failure to lock and tag the belt drive at the power source to guard against motion, and a 104(b) order was issued for failure to abate this condition within the prescribed time period. Immediately before the 104(b) order was issued, miners were observed on top of the belt toward the working face. A 104(d)(1) order was issued for accumulations of coal float dust, coal fines and loose coal along the entirety of the belt, in the crosscuts along the offside of the belt and behind the take-up. A 104(d)(1) order was issued for an inadequate on-shift examination of the belt. Hazardous conditions, such as coal and float dust accumulations and the bottom belt rubbing against the belt stands, stuck training roller and bottom roller brackets were obvious and not recorded in the record book. On the working section, inspectors issued a 104(d)(1) order for the operator's failure to follow the approved ventilation plan requiring the maintenance of the maximum curtain setback distance of 20 feet. Enforcement personnel found that the operator had been mining up to 30 feet from the deepest point of penetration without the placement of line curtains within the maximum distance of 20 feet to ventilate hazardous dust away from miners. The extendable line curtain in the entry did not touch the mine roof or the mine floor as required in the approved ventilation plan. These violations, which put miners at elevated risk for black lung, resulted in a revocation of the deep cut plan at this mine. Seven 104(a) citations (link is external) were issued for ventilation, electrical and health violations. Following the MSHA closeout, the operator developed and implemented a corrective action plan and made improvements to the mine's ventilation plan. Beginning Jan. 13, MSHA conducted an impact inspection at Norlite LLC's Cohoes Mine and Mill in Albany County, N.Y. This surface shale operation employs approximately 85 miners. MSHA issued 41 citations and orders to the mine operator and seven citations to independent contractors. On two different occurrences, a miner was observed under a suspended load of materials. Miners were exposed to inadvertent contact with a rotating conveyor tail pulley due to a missing guard that was lying approximately two feet away from the conveyor. A cover on the energized 480-volt wire tray was not secured in place, thereby exposing the inner conductors to damage. Such damage could create a ground fault condition and the potential for a fatal electrical shock. A miner was observed moving an air compressor with a forklift without securing it with safety chains, causing the potential for it to fall and roll uncontrollably. Inspectors observed a 480-volt power cord with damage to its outer protective jackets, which could expose miners to electrical shock. Several other hazardous conditions were found, such as: missing handrails, defective ladders, and oxygen and acetylene cylinders left open and unattended. Since April 2010, MSHA has conducted 714 impact inspections and issued 11,760 citations, 1,087 orders and 49 safeguards.

"January 6, 2014",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20140009,MSHA News Release: MSHA releases preliminary fatality and injury data for 2013 [01/06/2014],"Mining deaths sharply higher in 4th quarter, following record low fatality rates ARLINGTON, Va. — According to preliminary data released by the U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration, 42 miners died in work-related accidents at the nation's mines in 2013, an increase from the 36 miners who died in 2012. While mining fatalities occurred at a record low rate for the first three quarters of 2013, during the fourth quarter of 2013, six coal miners and nine metal/nonmetal miners died in mining accidents, a significant increase from the same period in 2012, when four coal miners and two metal/nonmetal miners died. ""Mining deaths are preventable, and those that occurred in 2013 are no exception,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""While we have made a number of improvements and have been moving mine safety in the right direction, the increased number of metal/nonmetal deaths makes clear we need to do more to protect our nation's miners. ""It takes the entire mining community to continue to reach new milestones in health and safety,"" he added. ""Miners need the reassurance that they will return home safe and healthy after every shift."" Last year, there were 20 coal mining and 22 metal/nonmetal mining fatalities, compared with 20 and 16, respectively, in 2012. Four mining deaths in 2013 involved contractors (two each in coal and metal/nonmetal), marking the fewest number of contractor deaths since MSHA began maintaining contractor data in 1983. Fourteen of the coal mining deaths occurred underground and six occurred at surface operations. In metal/nonmetal mining, five deaths occurred underground, and 17 occurred at surface operations. The most common causes of mining accidents in 2013 involved machinery and powered haulage equipment. West Virginia had the most coal mining deaths, with six, and Kentucky had the most metal/nonmetal mining deaths, with four. Preliminary fatality and injury rate data for the first three quarters of 2013 were .0112 and 2.45, respectively, below the rates for the same period in 2012, which marked the lowest such rates recorded in a calendar year in mining history. [Note: Rates are determined by the number of fatalities or injuries per 200,000 hours worked. Rates for calendar year 2013, which are calculated using operator-reported employment hours, are not yet available.] For fiscal year 2013 (Oct. 1, 2012, through Sept. 30, 2013), preliminary data indicate a record-low fatality rate of .0104 and injury rate of 2.42, as well as the fewest number of mining deaths at 33. Main stressed that, to prevent deaths, mine operators must: maintain effective safety and health management programs that are constantly evaluated, continue find-and-fix programs to identify and eliminate mine hazards, and provide training for all mining personnel. Among the measures MSHA has undertaken to prevent mining deaths are: increasing surveillance and strategic enforcement through impact inspections at mines with troubling compliance histories; enhancing pattern of violations actions; implementing special initiatives, such as "" Rules to Live By ,"" which focuses attention on the most common causes of mining deaths; and engaging in outreach efforts with the mining community.

The project will provide training to youth to help them develop marketable skills and serve as civic leaders in their communities. ""With the youngest population in the world, Africa faces the acute challenge of providing its young people with opportunities for decent work,"" said Deputy Undersecretary of Labor for International Affairs Carol Pier. ""This project aims to equip youth with the skills and resources they need to escape poverty and exploitative child labor and become leaders in their communities."" The project will provide youth with formal education and training in entrepreneurship and agribusiness. It will also support and encourage them to take on leadership roles within their communities. For families, the project will help them improve their livelihoods through skills training and income-generating opportunities. The project is intended to serve as a pilot initiative that could be replicated in other African countries. It will support President Obama's http://youngafricanleaders.state.gov (link is external) . Young African Leaders Initiative, which is focused on investing in the next generation of African leaders and strengthening partnerships between the United States and Africa.

"December 26, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20132413,EBSA News Release: Labor Department files suit to restore losses to the Miller's Health Systems Employee Stock Ownership Plan [12/26/2013],"WARSAW, Ind — The U.S. Department of Labor has filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court to recover losses to the Miller's Health Systems, Inc., Employee Stock Ownership Plan. The suit alleges that PBI Bank, Inc., the trustee of the plan, authorized the purchase of company stock for $40 million, an amount far in excess of the fair market value of the stock. The suit also alleges that PBI Bank approved financing for the transaction at an excessive interest rate. Miller's Health is a Warsaw-based company that manages long-term care and assisted-living facilities. ""Fiduciaries must act with undivided loyalty to plan participants. When it comes to ESOP stock purchases, they must ensure that the plan receives full value for its money,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Employee Benefits Security Phyllis C. Borzi. An investigation by the Chicago Regional Office of the department's Employee Benefits Security Administration focused on a September 2007 stock purchase. The suit alleges that PBI violated ERISA by imprudently and disloyally approving the purchase of stock by the plan. The suit seeks to require PBI to restore all losses suffered by the ESOP, plus interest. At the time of the stock purchase, Miller's Health managed 31 long-term care facilities under the name of Miller's Mary Manor and 10 assisted living facilities under the name Miller's Senior Living. Miller's Health also operated Theracare, Inc., an Indiana corporation, which primarily provided physical and occupational therapy and speech-language pathology to residents in Miller's Health facilities. After conducting its investigation, the department concluded that, as a result of the design of the transaction and the fiduciary breaches of PBI, the stock purchase was not for the primary benefit of participants and did not promote employee ownership in Miller's Health. As a result, the department concluded that PBI was responsible and liable for violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The lawsuit also seeks to remove PBI as a fiduciary and service provider of the plan and to permanently bar it from serving as a fiduciary or service provider to ERISA-covered plans in the future. As of Sept. 30, 2012, the ESOP had 2,939 participants and assets of $12,848,000. For help with problems related to private sector retirement and health plans, employers and workers can reach EBSA's Chicago office at 312-353-0900 or toll-free at 866-444-3272. EBSA protects the retirement, health and other workplace-related benefits of America's workers, retirees and their families. The agency oversees approximately 684,000 active private sector retirement plans, 2.4 million health plans and other plans that provide benefits to more than 141 million Americans.

"December 24, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20132381,EBSA News Release: Obama administration proposes adjustments to excepted benefits regulations [12/24/2013],"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Treasury today proposed rules that would adjust regulations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 regarding excepted benefits to include employee assistance programs (EAPs). The proposed rules would also provide added options for employees and employers in connection with the Affordable Care Act. ""This proposal would give employers and workers more options for their health-care coverage while staying true to the consumer protections put in place by the Affordable Care Act,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Employee Benefits Security Phyllis C. Borzi. ""This is another example of federal agencies listening to public concerns and responding with solutions."" Under the HIPAA, excepted benefits are exempt from certain health reform requirements, including some requirements added by the Affordable Care Act. Since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, employers, employees and other stakeholders expressed concerns that past HIPAA definitions should be updated in light of new Affordable Care Act standards. The proposed rules would amend current regulations to treat certain EAPs as excepted benefits, effective immediately. EAPs are typically free programs offered by employers that can provide wide-ranging benefits to address circumstances that might otherwise adversely affect employees’ work and health. Benefits may include short-term substance abuse or mental health counseling or referral services, as well as financial counseling and legal services. Under the proposed rules, EAPs would be considered excepted benefits if the program is free to employees and does not provide significant benefits in the nature of medical care or treatment. As excepted benefits, EAPs would be exempt from private insurance market reforms, and EAP coverage would not make individuals ineligible for a premium tax credit for enrolling in qualified health plans through the Health Insurance Marketplace. Similarly, under the proposed regulations, vision and dental benefits provided by employers on a self-insured basis would be able to qualify as excepted benefits effective immediately, even if they do not require contributions from employees. Insured vision and dental benefits, as well as self-insured vision and dental coverage that requires employee contributions, already qualify as excepted benefits. Effective for plan years starting in 2015, the proposed rules also would treat as excepted benefits certain limited coverage provided by plan sponsors that ""wraps around"" an individual market policy. The ""wraparound"" coverage would be available to employees for whom the plan sponsor’s primary group health coverage is not affordable and who instead get coverage through a nongrandfathered individual market policy. The wraparound coverage would provide extra benefits or broader networks, and may also reduce cost sharing. The proposal would not allow the wraparound coverage to substitute for employment-based coverage. The value of the wraparound coverage could not exceed 15 percent of the value of the primary coverage offered by the plan sponsor, which must be affordable for at least the majority of employees. The proposed rules were published in the Dec. 24, 2013, edition of the Federal Register and can be viewed at https://federalregister.gov/a/2013-30553 (link is external) ."

An OFCCP review of the facility determined that the dairy company used a hiring process that violated Executive Order 11246 because it discriminated against women, African Americans and Asian Americans who applied for warehouse positions in 2010. ""I am pleased that we were able to reach a fair settlement in this case,"" said OFCCP Director Patricia A. Shiu. ""Today's agreement underscores the notion that federal contractors, like Cream-O-Land, should closely examine their employment policies and practices to identify and eliminate any unfair barriers to equal opportunity. Under the terms of the conciliation agreement, Cream-O-Land will pay $324,288 in back wages, interest and benefits to the rejected applicants. The company will also make 24 job offers to the affected class members as positions become available. Additionally, the company has agreed to undertake extensive self-monitoring measures, including committing a minimum of $10,000 for training to ensure that all of its hiring processes comply with the law. Cream-O-Land Dairy Inc. delivers dairy products to grocery stores, supermarkets and schools throughout New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Connecticut. In Fiscal Year 2012, Cream-O-Land sold more than $1.5 million worth of products to federal agencies such as the Federal Prison System, Department of Veterans Affairs, Defense Commissary Agency, Defense Logistics Agency and Department of the Army. In addition to Executive Order 11246, OFCCP enforces Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974. These three laws require those who do business with the federal government, contractors and subcontractors, to follow the fair and reasonable standard that they not discriminate in employment on the basis of sex, race, color, religion, national origin, disability or status as a protected veteran.

In October, MSHA conducted impact inspections at six coal mines and three metal and nonmetal mines, where inspectors issued 120 citations and 10 orders. Impact inspections were curtailed during part of October due to the government shutdown. The monthly inspections, which began in force in April 2010 following the explosion at the Upper Big Branch Mine, involve mines that merit increased agency attention and enforcement due to their poor compliance history or particular compliance concerns. On Nov. 21, MSHA conducted an impact inspection at Maple Coal Co.'s Maple Eagle No. 1 Mine in Fayette County, W.Va. Inspectors traveled belt lines, inspected mobile and stationary equipment, and evaluated section ventilation and roof control. They issued 36 citations and six orders; it was the eighth impact inspection at this mine. During the inspection, enforcement personnel observed a 20-foot crack in the mine roof at a belt feeder where miners regularly travel. Inspectors also found an area of loose roof strata 60 feet long and up to 8 feet wide where miners were at risk of being struck by falling rock. MSHA issued a 104(d)(1) withdrawal order for violating the approved roof control plan and failing to install needed roof supports. The operator was also cited for a loose coal rib approximately 24 feet long that was cracked and separating from the solid wall. These hazards had the potential to cause catastrophic injuries or fatalities to miners. Maple Eagle No.1 Mine was issued three 104(d)(1) withdrawal orders for violating the approved ventilation plan. The operator did not properly construct or complete several overcasts (enclosed airways used to maintain ventilation) in several entries. The operator also failed to maintain intake airways clear of combustible materials, and had let water accumulate in one of the entries. The mine operator was cited for failing to identify and correct in its preshift inspection hazards that were obvious, extensive and had existed for several shifts. While monitoring the mine's communication system, MSHA detected and cited the mine operator for providing advance notice.

"December 17, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20131217,"Hawaii contractor to restore more than $460,000 to employee profit-sharing plan","HONOLULU - The U.S. Department of Labor has secured a consent judgment with Aiea-based cement construction and contracting company Reef Development of Hawaii Inc. and its president, Samuel Sanchez Aguirre. An investigation by the department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration established that Aguirre, acting as trustee to the profit-sharing plan, violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act by mismanaging plan assets, resulting in more than $700,000 in lost principal, plus approximately $303,000 in lost interest. “The law calls for the plan fiduciaries to exercise the highest level of care when it comes to managing employee benefits plans,” said Crisanta Johnson, director of the Los Angeles Regional Office of EBSA, which investigated the case. “Plan fiduciaries are not guarantors, but must act prudently when making investment decisions.” Investigators found that Aguirre neglected his fiduciary responsibilities by not acting carefully in the selection and monitoring of investments made on behalf of the profit-sharing plan. Aguirre’s lack of due diligence prior to making investments violates ERISA’s requirements of acting solely in the interest of participants and beneficiaries of the plan. The investigation found that Aguirre directed $550,000 to shares of a Texas-based company that later filed for bankruptcy and was exposed as a Ponzi scheme. The plan also suffered a loss of $950,000 in debt instruments invested in a hotel restoration project that was foreclosed. The investigation, which began in April 2011, surveyed plan activity between 2006 and 2011. In all, 50 plan participants were affected by Aguirre’s investment choices. The consent judgment and order requires Aguirre to restore $463,236 in losses to the plan attributable to nonfiduciary participants within 30 days of the judgment’s filing. Once the funds have been restored, Aguirre and the fiduciaries will terminate the plan and disburse the funds. Upon the plan’s termination, Aguirre is permanently enjoined from serving as a fiduciary or service provider to any employee benefit plan subject to ERISA. Additionally, Aguirre has been assessed a penalty equal to 20 percent of the recovery amount, or $92,647. Reef Development of Hawaii specializes in cement work, restoration and additions to property, and commercial developments. EBSA protects the retirement, health and other workplace-related benefits of America’s workers, retirees and their families. The agency oversees approximately 701,000 private sector retirement plans, 2.3 million health plans and other plans that provide benefits to more than 141 million Americans.

"December 17, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20132290,WHD News Release: Hibachi Grill & Supreme Buffet sued by US Labor Department to recover nearly $2 million in unpaid wages and damages for 84 employees [12/17/2013],"JONESBORO, Ga . — The U.S. Department of Labor has filed a lawsuit against Wang's Partner Inc., doing business as Hibachi Grill & Supreme Buffet in Jonesboro, and its owner, Shu Wang, to recover unpaid wages and damages under, Fair Labor Standards Act . The department is seeking $1,997,726 in back wages and liquidated damages for 84 employees. The lawsuit is based on an investigation by the department's Wage and Hour Division, which revealed numerous violations of the FLSA. The lawsuit has been filed by the department's Office of the Solicitor in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. Investigators from the division's Atlanta district office found that the employer misclassified servers as independent contractors, failed to pay servers and kitchen staff at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour and failed to pay overtime compensation at time and one-half employees' regular rates for hours worked beyond 40 in a work week. Additionally, the employer did not maintain accurate records of hours worked and wages paid. ""The U.S. Department of Labor is committed to ensuring that all workers receive the wages to which they are legally entitled,"" said Secretary of Labor Thomas E. Perez. ""We will not stand by while employers use business models that hurt workers, their families and law-abiding employers. This lawsuit illustrates that the department will use every enforcement tool necessary to resolve cases where employees are unlawfully treated as independent contractors, and vulnerable workers are not paid the minimum wage."" The FLSA requires that covered employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 for all hours worked, plus time and one-half their regular rates, including commissions, bonuses and incentive pay, for hours worked beyond 40 per week. In general, ""hours worked"" includes all time an employee must be on duty, or on the employer's premises or at any other prescribed place of work, from the beginning of the first principal work activity to the end of the last principal activity of the workday. Additionally, the law requires that accurate records of employees' wages, hours and other conditions of employment be maintained. The misclassification of workers as something other than employees, such as independent contractors, presents a serious problem for affected employees, employers and to the entire economy. Misclassified employees are often denied access to critical benefits and protections, such as family and medical leave, overtime, minimum wage and unemployment insurance. Employee misclassification also generates substantial losses to state and federal treasuries, and to the Social Security and Medicare funds, as well as to state unemployment insurance and workers compensation funds.

"December 12, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20131212,"OPA News Release: African-American literature, authors central to Labor Department's Books that Shaped Work in America project  [12/12/2013]","WASHINGTON — From Harriet Beecher Stowe's "" Uncle Tom's Cabin "" to Maya Angelou's "" I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings ,"" African-American literature and authors are represented in the titles of fiction, nonfiction, plays and poetry included on the initial roll of Books that Shaped Work in America. The Web-based project, www.dol.gov/books, part of the U.S. Department of Labor ongoing commemoration of its 100th anniversary, and in partnership with the Center for the Book in the Library of Congress, aims to engage the public about the department's mission and America's history as a nation of workers as portrayed through published works. The project serves as an online book club where people from all walks of life can share books that informed them about occupations and careers, molded their views about work and helped elevate the discourse about work, workers and workplaces. At the same time, the site provides a unique way for people to learn about the mission and resources of the U.S. Department of Labor. ""The Books that Shaped Work in America initiative explores the dignity of work and our progress in expanding America's fundamental promise of opportunity for all through the lens of literature,"" said U.S. Secretary of Labor Thomas E. Perez. ""This progress cannot be understood and fully appreciated without also examining the struggle for access to opportunity and equal rights that has been a part of the American experience, particularly with respect to African Americans in the 20th Century."" Work, like our nation, is constantly evolving, and so Books that Shaped Work in America is no different. To get it started, 24 individuals, including Perez, eight former secretaries of labor from Democratic and Republican administrations, civil rights leaders, authors and media personalities submitted suggestions. Among the contributors: former Secretary of Labor Alexis Herman, President of the National Urban League Marc Morial and the Labor Department's Women's Bureau head Latifa Lyles. Their recommendations are included on the initiative's website, along with brief summaries of each book and links to related U.S. Department of Labor resources. Now the public is invited to expand the list. A simple, online form, which can be found at http://www.dol.gov/books/form, makes it easy for anyone to suggest a book. From August Wilson's collection of plays in ' The Pittsburgh Cycle ' to Claude Brown's ' Manchild in the Promised Land ' to Isabel Wilkerson's ' The Warmth of Other Suns ,' many of the books on the list demonstrate the relationship between work and the African-American experience. While workplace discrimination was often a barrier to opportunity, good jobs and hard work was also a tool for overcoming inequality. Many of the books on the list reflect this and demonstrate the positive impact a changing workplace had on the nation. Books like Richard Wright's ' Native Son ' and Zora Neale Hurston's ' Their Eyes Were Watching God, ' along with memoirs from Frederick Douglass and Dorothy Height, have influenced the working lives of both those who fought for equal rights and all of us who benefitted from their efforts. The project was inspired by the Center for the Book in the Library of Congress' 2012 Books That Shaped America exhibition, which explored the impact of books on American life and culture. Many of the books in that exhibition had work as a central theme, bringing to light the significant role published works have played in shaping America's view of workers and workplaces throughout its history. Created in 1913, the mission of the U.S. Department of Labor is to foster, promote and develop the welfare of the wage earners, job seekers and retirees of the United States; improve working conditions; advance opportunities for profitable employment; and assure work-related benefits and rights.

During the course of an investigation by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Employee Benefits Security Administration, the agency found that from September 2005 to March 2010, the company and Susan Clingman-Banks failed in their fiduciary responsibility to timely forward at least $63,934.69 in employee contributions to the plan and also allowed the funds to be commingled with general company assets. Resolution: In the consent judgment and order, the defendants agreed to make restitution to the plan in the sum of $78,880.97, representing previously unremitted employee contributions totaling $63,934.69, plus interest on those funds of $14,945.88 through Nov. 30, 2013.

Resolution: The complaint seeks restitution to the plan of delinquent employee contributions and loan repayments, including lost opportunity costs; the appointment of an independent fiduciary to administer or terminate the plan, and any remaining individual account balances that Clark has in the plan to offset against the losses including the costs of an independent fiduciary.

"December 10, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20131210,ETA News Release: Oregon receives $1.18M US Labor Department grant for its short-time compensation layoff prevention program [12/10/2013],"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Labor today announced the award of $1,189,280 to the State of Oregon to enhance the state's short-time compensation program, a layoff prevention program, also known as ""work sharing."" STC programs (link is external) allow employers facing economic difficulty to reduce work hours for a group of employees as an alternative to layoffs. The programs allow workers with reduced hours to supplement their lowered wages with a percentage of the weekly unemployment compensation that would have been available to them had they been laid off entirely. STC allows employees to keep their jobs — and benefits such as employer-based retirement and health insurance — and helps employers retain skilled workers and avoid the costs of hiring and training new workers when the business recovers. The program also eases the strain on local economies, which acutely suffer when layoffs occur. ""Short-time compensation, and programs like it, gives employers the tools they need to keep skilled workers during a temporary dip in business and is good for local communities, the state and the overall national economy,"" said U.S. Secretary of Labor Thomas E. Perez . ""Oregon is leading by example by making this innovative program available to more employers. I encourage all states to take advantage of the federal resources available to start or expand their own programs."" Oregon will use $396,426 of the federal funds awarded for enhancements to the state's STC program, and will use the remaining $792,854 for promotional activities and to increase employer enrollment into the program. The funding was made available through the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 (link is external) , which gives the Secretary of Labor the authority to award grants to states to implement or enhance an STC program, raise awareness at the state level and enroll employers in an STC program. States with an existing program may also be eligible to receive federal reimbursement for STC benefits paid.

The funding will help facilitate partnerships with the justice system to recruit court-involved youth interested in participating in the program and provide them with education and training to obtain an industry-recognized credential. ""The youth unemployment rate continues to remain very high. The barriers to a good job are even higher for those with juvenile records,"" said U.S. Secretary of Labor Thomas E. Perez . ""This grant competition helps break down barriers and provides these youth with opportunities to succeed through effective, evidence-based education and job training programs."" Developed in the early 1990s, the National Guard Youth ChalleNGe program seeks to improve the life and employment prospects of young people, aged 16 to 18, who have dropped out of high school and are disconnected from the labor market. The program instills military-based discipline and training combined with educational instruction, experiential learning and mentoring. Cadets engage in supervised work experience and complete eight core program components during a six-month residential phase at an active or closed National Guard base, training center, or school campus. The program now operates in 27 states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia, and has served more than 120,000 young people since it began. The Job ChalleNGe grant will help existing Youth ChalleNGe programs expand to provide court-involved youth with vocational education including the technical skills required to perform a specific job, and on-the-job training. Participants will receive support in the development of their career and academic goals and understanding long-term career and education pathway options. Most importantly, participants will be provided work-based learning, and actual work experience through field trips, job-shadowing and other opportunities to expose them to additional career paths and prepare them for the world of work. The department will award up to $4,000,000 each to three grantees through this competition. Grantees must currently operate a National Guard Youth ChalleNGe program pursuant to a Cooperative Agreement with the United States Property and Fiscal Officer, National Guard Bureau.

"December 6, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20132357,OPA News Release: Statement of Labor Secretary Perez on November employment numbers [12/06/2013],"WASHINGTON — Secretary of Labor Thomas E. Perez issued the following statement about the November 2013 Employment Situation report released today: ""The American economy continues its broad and steady job growth heading into the New Year, adding 203,000 jobs in November. The unemployment rate dropped to 7.0 percent, and American manufacturing remained strong with the addition of 27,000 new jobs. ""The November employment report continues the 45-month trend of private-sector job growth, with 8.1 million new jobs created over that time. In the last 12 months alone, American businesses have added 2.3 million new private-sector jobs. This puts the American economy in a strong position heading into the December holiday season. ""But despite broad-based job growth, the November report reminds us that far too many American families are still struggling to get by. The rate of unemployment for the long-term unemployed remains higher than at any point prior to the Great Recession. As the president underscored earlier this week, growing inequality and a lack of upward mobility has jeopardized middle-class America's basic bargain — that if you work hard, you have a chance to get ahead. This point was underscored by a report released this week highlighting that if Congress fails to act, 1.3 million workers and their families will lose Emergency Unemployment Compensation benefits immediately. ""The progress made since the depths of the recession in 2010 is a testament to the resilience of the American economy and the American people. But we can and should be doing more. We must invest in infrastructure, pass comprehensive immigration reform, extend the Emergency Unemployment Compensation program and raise the minimum wage. Current job growth is happening in spite of Congress, not because of it. It's time Congress does its part to accelerate job growth and give more Americans the chance to climb ladders of opportunity."""
"December 5, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20131205-0,US Labor Department releases advance copies of 2013 Form 5500 annual report,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor's Employee Benefits Security Administration, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation today released advance informational copies of the 2013 Form 5500 annual return/report and related instructions. Modifications to the Form 5500 and Form 5500-SF and their schedules and instructions for plan year 2013 are described under ""Changes to Note"" in the 2013 instructions, including: Form 5500 – DOL Form M-1 Compliance Information. The Department of Labor published earlier this year final rules under the Affordable Care Act to protect workers and employers whose health benefits are provided through Multiple Employer Welfare Arrangements (MEWAs). The final rules increased the department's enforcement authority to protect participants in MEWAs and called for such plans to adhere to enhanced filing requirements. In that regard, the Form 5500 includes a new section “Form M-1 Compliance Information,” which is being added as an attachment to the Form 5500 for the 2013 plan year. Also, all welfare plans required to file the Form M-1, “ Report for Multiple Employer Welfare Arrangements (MEWAs) and Certain Entities Claiming Exception (ECEs), ” must now file the Form 5500 regardless of plan size or type of funding (including small unfunded or insured welfare plans). Schedules H and I – PBGC Coverage Question. A new element 5c has been added to Line 5 of Schedules H and I that asks defined benefit pension plan filers whether the plan is covered under the PBGC insurance program. This question replaces Plan Characteristic Code 1G previously used on line 8a of the Form 5500 to identify plans covered by the PBGC insurance program. Schedule SB. The Schedule SB instructions have been updated to reflect the provisions of the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (“MAP‑21”). In addition, the Schedule SB instructions for line 11b have been clarified for plans where the valuation date for the prior plan year was not the first day of the plan year. These advance copies of the 2013 Form 5500 are for informational purposes only and cannot be used to file a 2013 Form 5500 annual return/report. Pension and welfare benefit plans that are required to file electronically an annual return/report regarding their financial conditions, investments and operations each year generally satisfy that requirement by filing the Form 5500 or Form 5500-SF and any required attachments. Informational copies of the forms, schedules and instructions are available online at www.dol.gov/ebsa/5500main.html . Filers should monitor the EFAST website for the availability of the official electronic versions for filing using EFAST-approved software or directly through the EFAST website.

Main on National Miners Day [12/05/2013],"ARLINGTON, Va. — Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health, issued the following statement on National Miner's Day: ""Today, we celebrate the fourth annual National Miner's Day. In 2009, Congress proclaimed that each December 6 would be recognized in remembrance of the 1907 Monongah coal mine disaster, which resulted in the deaths of 362 miners and became the worst mining accident in American history. The Proclamation (link is external) designates this date 'in appreciation, honor and remembrance of the accomplishments and sacrifices of the miners of our Nation; and encourages the people of the United States to participated in local and national activities celebrating and honoring the contributions of miners.' ""American miners play a much larger role in our lives than most people realize. They extract a variety of raw materials, such as coal, copper, phosphate, silver, limestone, iron and zinc — ores that are essential components in the products we use every day. Coal, and the electricity generated by coal power, play prominent roles in our homes, businesses and communities. Miners produce the gravel, crushed stone, tar, asphalt, road salt and cement used to build the roads we travel on and to make them safer. The bridges we build to span canyons and rivers are built with rock and mineral products produced by miners. ""Gold, silver and copper wiring, ceramic insulators, and silicon processing and memory chips are essential components in electronics that we use daily, such as smartphones, computers and televisions. Thousands of everyday consumer goods are made with the fundamental materials secured from the hard work of miners. They range from cosmetics to toothpaste, from cookware and dinnerware to appliances. ""American miners work every day to provide the necessities of life. They deserve protection on the job from workplace hazards that have killed tens of thousands and injured hundreds of thousands of miners throughout our history. The first shift of miners at the Virginia-Pocahauntas Coal Co. Mine No. 4 near Richlands, Va., leave the elevator. (Credit: National Archives, 556393) ""We are making progress. In 1907, the same year as the Monongah disaster, 3,000 miners died in tragic accidents. Fatalities numbering in the thousand were not uncommon during the first part of the 20th century. These numbers decreased to about 140 in the 1970s due in large part to the passage of the Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969 and the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. The 1977 Act created the Mine Safety and Health Administration in the U.S. Department of Labor to oversee the safety and health of miners. Thirty-five years later, we have seen the lowest fatality rate in this nation's history. And, through the End Black Lung — Act Now initiative and other occupational health efforts, we are making progress in limiting miners' exposure to respirable dust and other harmful contaminants. While more needs to be done to prevent death, injury and illness in the nation's mines, our efforts and collaboration with labor and industry stakeholders are showing positive results. ""We will continue to work hard to send miners home safe and healthy at the end of every shift. On this National Miners Day, we honor their contributions and thank them for the sacrifices they have made on behalf of this nation. We hope the American people will join us in commemorating this day of recognition."" Editor's Note : Main's radio actuality on National Miner's Day is available for public use."

The former employee, a general laborer at the stone-crushing plant, filed a complaint with the department's Mine Safety and Health Administration in November 2011 alleging that the company had terminated his employment on Sept. 30, 2011, in retaliation for his having made recurring safety complaints. MSHA's investigation found that the complainant had engaged in protected activity when he alerted the company about unresolved safety problems. Examples of this protected activity are the complainant's refusal to turn on the plant's generator until required safety guards had been installed and calling MSHA to report the company's failure to install those safety guards.

The former employee, a general laborer at the stone-crushing plant, filed a complaint with the department's Mine Safety and Health Administration in November 2011 alleging that the company had terminated his employment on Sept. 30, 2011, in retaliation for his having made recurring safety complaints. MSHA's investigation found that the complainant had engaged in protected activity when he alerted the company about unresolved safety problems. Examples of this protected activity are the complainant's refusal to turn on the plant's generator until required safety guards had been installed and calling MSHA to report the company's failure to install those safety guards.

Larry Lefoldt as independent fiduciary to manage the 401(k) plan of the defunct Windswept Environmental Group Inc. of Holtsville. The department filed suit in December 2012, asking the court to appoint an independent fiduciary to administer the plan and distribute its assets to the plan’s participants and beneficiaries. “The department took this legal action so the plan’s participants can access the funds that rightly belong to them,” said Jonathan Kay, regional director for the department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration in New York. “Workers should know that they can turn to the department for assistance when their retirement plan has been abandoned, and they have not received the benefits to which they are entitled. We are here to help them.” The 401(k) plan was established in May 2001. The plan’s administrator, trustee and sole fiduciary, Michael O’Reily, passed away in November 2008, and Windswept Environmental ceased operations in February 2009. As a result, no one was administering the 401(k) plan, and certain former employees of the company did not receive a distribution of their benefits. Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, plans must be managed by fiduciaries. In the absence of a plan fiduciary, participants and beneficiaries may not be able to obtain plan information, make investments or collect retirement benefits. In this case, the plan has 12 participants and more than $129,000 in assets. This suit resulted from an investigation conducted by EBSA’s New York Regional Office. The case was litigated by the department’s Regional Office of the Solicitor in New York.

While operating a forklift without the rollover protection structure, the worker was struck by an operating machine that he traveled beneath. As a result of the inspection, OSHA placed the company in its Severe Violator Enforcement Program. ""This was a terrible, preventable tragedy that underscores the importance of OSHA's standards. Employers are required to use equipment in accordance with manufacturer's specifications and ensure adequate guarding to prevent contact with operating machinery,"" said Bill Wilkerson, OSHA's area director in Cincinnati. ""Employers are responsible for identifying hazards and ensuring workers follow proper procedures to prevent injury or death."" One willful violation involved failing to have adequate machine guarding on the rotary digester, which would have prevented the worker from coming into contact with machinery operating parts. A willful violation is one committed with intentional, knowing or voluntary disregard for, or plain indifference to, employee safety and health. One serious violation involves modifying a skid-steer loader by removing the rollover protective structure without manufacturer approval. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known. Proposed fines total $77,000. Due to the nature and severity of violations, the company has been placed in OSHA's Severe Violator Enforcement Program, which mandates targeted follow-up inspections to ensure compliance with the law. The agency's SVEP focuses on recalcitrant employers that endanger workers by committing willful, repeat or failure-to-abate violations. Under the program, OSHA may inspect any of the employer's facilities if it has reasonable grounds to believe there are similar violations. Cheney Pulp and Paper Co. manufactures pulp for the paper industry and employs approximately 35 workers. OSHA inspected the facility in 2010, which resulted in 27 violations. The company has 15 business days from receipt of the citations and notice of proposed penalties to contest the citations and proposed penalties before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. If a company does not file or contest within that period, it must abate the cited conditions within the period ordered in the citations and pay the proposed penalties. To ask questions, obtain compliance assistance, file a complaint, or report workplace hospitalizations, fatalities or situations posing imminent danger to workers, the public should call OSHA's toll-free hotline at 800-321-OSHA (6742) or the agency's Cincinnati Area Office at 513-841-4132. Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. OSHA's role is to ensure these conditions for America's working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education and assistance.

"November 26, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20132309,MSHA News Release: MSHA issues fourth POV notice under revised rule [11/26/2013],"ARLINGTON, Va. — The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration announced today that Coal River Mining LLC's Fork Creek No. 1 Mine in Lincoln County, W.Va., has been put on notice of a pattern of violations of mandatory health or safety standards under Section 104(e) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. An MSHA audit revealed that the mine operator failed to report miner injuries equivalent to 239 days of lost time during the review period. MSHA cited 158 significant and substantial violations at Fork Creek No. 1 from Sept. 1, 2012, through Aug. 31, 2013, including 14 for roof and rib hazards, 21 for ventilation hazards and 21 for explosion hazards. The mine's S&S issuance rate was 8.83 per 100 inspection hours during the review period, compared to a rate of 3.62 for all underground coal mines during the same period. During the review period, the mine ranked fifth in the nation (tying with one other operation) in elevated citations and withdrawal orders with 24 issuances. On Oct. 24, 2013, MSHA issued the first three POV notices under its revised rule that went into effect in March. Fork Creek No. 1 Mine, along with several other operations, was undergoing an audit of its injury records at the same time. Under the Mine Act, MSHA is required to identify mines exhibiting a pattern of significant and substantial violations and authorized to issue POV notices to mine operators that, through this pattern, demonstrate a disregard for the health and safety of miners. A POV notice, one of the agency's toughest enforcement actions, is reserved for the mines that pose the greatest risk to the safety of miners. An S&S violation is one that is reasonably likely to result in a reasonably serious injury or illness. The Mine Act requires mines that receive an S&S violation during any inspection within 90 days of a POV notice be issued a withdrawal order for that violation and for all subsequent S&S violations — removing miners from affected areas and abating the violation until an inspection of the entire mine finds no S&S violations. ""While it took an MSHA audit to discover the extent of unreported injuries at the mine, Coal River was also aware of the compliance issues it was experiencing and did not take sufficient action to make necessary safety improvements,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. This completes MSHA's current round of POV notifications."

We also had compliance officers other staff, Edward Marshall and Jeb Stuart, visiting residents in other affected areas, such as Pekin, East Peoria and Coal City. The tornado packed winds of 190 mph and a path of destruction that stretched for more than 46 miles through Tazewell and Woodford counties, according to the weather service. The staff was there to provide help and assistance. Tornadoes were also reported in the small town of Gifford near Rantoul, Metropolis in far southeast Illinois, and Frankfort and Manhattan in Will County. OSHA responders from the area offices in Calumet City, North Aurora and Fairview Heights responded to these areas and offered assistance as well. What we have found are people sifting through debris piles looking for personal items and being exposing to various safety and health hazards. Some of the most pressing hazards are struck-by hazards from debris, unstable structures and puncture hazards from exposed nails and shards of wood and glass. We also found children and adults climbing and working on roofs on their homes without fall protection or training and entering basements with unstable structures above. Our focus right now is on the residents of the community and helping them minimize their own risk of injury and illness as they work through the recovery of personal items and removal of debris. We are telling people to wear protective clothing such as gloves, and closed toed shoes, not to enter unstable structures and just trying to bring awareness to them of the hazardous they may encounter. People are really receptive to the help. Most residents have never been involved in a disaster recovery operation and really aren't aware of many of the dangers present. They just want to salvage what they can of their lives. One of the biggest challenges is educating people about the role of OSHA in disaster recovery . Often times people believe OSHA is there in an enforcement role, but our role is to help protect workers and volunteers from potential hazards caused by the storm. We want to minimize further stress and grief to the residents that could occur if workers, volunteers or residents are injured in recovery efforts. Response and recovery work in tornado-impacted areas presents safety and health hazards that should be properly identified, evaluated and controlled in a systematic manner. Some operations, such as utility restoration, cleaning up spills of hazardous materials, and search and rescue, should only be conducted by workers who have the proper training, equipment and experience. As Washington moves into this phase of clean-up in the next few days, we will be working with contractors to ensure they are working safely. As power is restored, it will bring new concerns as well in ensuring residents and workers are operating safely. The Regional Office safety and health manager Larken S. Akins is working with the local Incident Commander to offer OSHA's services assisting with safety and health concerns for workers and residents and with conducting risk assessments. We are also providing fact sheets and quick cards , which provide access to online resources. I believe this is a very important role for OSHA to be able to help the community in recovering and rebuilding safely. Specific hazards associated with working in the aftermath of tornados that we detailed in our safety sheets included: Hazardous driving conditions due to slippery and/or blocked roadways, slips and falls due to slippery walkways; Falling and flying objects, such as tree limbs and utility poles; Sharp objects including nails and broken glass; Electrical hazards from downed power lines or downed objects in contact with power lines and the use of portable generators that may be missing safety components or are not grounded properly; Falls from heights; Risk of entering unstable structures; Lack of communication services; Use of skid loaders and other mechanical equipment in areas with heavy pedestrian traffic and by inexperienced operators; Gas leaks and dangers posed by the restoration of utilities, such as unexpected energized lines; and Exhaustion from working extended shifts and dehydration."

"November 20, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20131120,OSHA News Release: US Department of Labor announces rules to update regulations and decrease burden on businesses [11/20/2013],"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Labor today announced four rules designed to reduce unnecessary burdens on employers by updating or rescinding obsolete regulations and requirements. A rule from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration updates and streamlines the standards for the use of mechanical power presses while the remaining three rules from the Employment and Training Administration rescind outdated Foreign Labor Certification regulations for the H-2A, F-1 and H-1A programs. The rules published today complement President Obama's executive order 13610 (link is external) to modernize the regulatory system and reduce unjustified regulatory burdens. ""Creating a framework that ensures workers are safe and treated fairly is the right thing to do, and updating rules and standards is also the right thing to do,"" said Dr. David Michaels, assistant secretary of labor for occupational safety and health. ""The rules announced today maintain standards, lessen the burden on employers and help grow our economy."" The OSHA rule issued today, along with a companion notice of proposed rulemaking, revises requirements of OSHA's standard for mechanical power presses, which punch, form or assemble metal or other materials. Workers can be exposed to hand, finger or arm injuries — often resulting in amputation — if parts of a press are worn, damaged or not operating properly. The new rule will eliminate a requirement for employers to document mandatory weekly inspections of these presses while clarifying the responsibility of employers to perform and document any maintenance or repairs necessary to protect the safety of workers who operate them. Removing the weekly inspection and test certifications will reduce 613,600 hours of unnecessary paperwork burden on employers. The final rule will be effective Feb.18, 2014, unless OSHA receives a significant adverse comment by Dec. 20, 2013. If the agency receives a significant adverse comment, the accompanying notice of proposed rulemaking will allow the agency to continue the notice-and-comment component of the rulemaking by withdrawing the direct final rule. Individuals may submit comments electronically at www.regulations.gov (link is external) , the Federal eRulemaking Portal. Submissions may also be sent via facsimile or mail. In addition, OSHA will align the existing standard's maintenance and repair provisions to the American National Standards Institute standard for safety requirements for mechanical power presses. This standard would explicitly state that maintenance and repair must be completed before the mechanical power press is operated and, in keeping with the ANSI standard, employers would certify maintenance and repair for the entire machine rather than for certain parts of the power press. See Federal Register notice at https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2013/11/20/2013-27695/record-requirements-in-the-mechanical-power-presses-standard (link is external) for more details. The Office of Foreign Labor Certification within the Employment and Training Administration announced three additional final rules today rescinding obsolete regulations. The first is the Direct Final Rule for the ETA Labor Certification Process for Logging Employment and Non-H-2A Agricultural Employment. This final rule rescinds the regulations found at 20 CFR 655 Subpart C, which established regulations for employers in the logging industry. Employers seeking to temporarily employ foreign workers in logging operations are now governed by the regulations in Subpart B applicable to H-2A agricultural work and the Subpart C has no force and effect. See Federal Register notice at https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2013/11/20/2013-27693/labor-certification-process-for-logging-employment-and-non-h-2a-agricultural-employment (link is external) for more details. The second is the Direct Final Rule for the ETA Attestation Process for Employers Using F-1 Students in Off-Campus Work. This final rule rescinds the regulations found at 20 CFR 655 subparts J and K, which provided rules governing employers seeking to hire F-1 foreign students as part-time workers off-campus. These subparts became obsolete after the authorizing statute and its two-year extension expired in 1996. Accordingly, the Department of Labor is taking this action to remove regulations that no longer have force and effect. See Federal Register notice at https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2013/11/20/2013-27685/attestation-process-for-employers-using-f-1-students-in-off-campus-work (link is external) for more details. The third is the Direct Final Rule for the ETA Removal of Attestation Process for Facilities Using H-1A Registered Nurses Subparts D and E Regulations. This final rule rescinds the regulations found at 20 CFR 655 Subparts D and E, which provided rules governing health care facilities using nonimmigrant foreign workers as registered nurses under the H-1A visa program. These subparts became obsolete after the authorizing statute and all extensions expired fully on Aug. 31, 2001.Accordingly, the department is taking this action to remove regulations that no longer have force and effect.

""The Books that Shaped Work in America (link is external) initiative explores the dignity of work and our progress in expanding America's fundamental promise of opportunity for all through the lens of literature,"" said U.S. Secretary of Labor Thomas E. Perez. ""Think of this effort as an online book club where people from all walks of life can share books that informed them about occupations and careers, molded their views about work and helped elevate the discourse about work, workers and workplaces. At the same time, the site provides a unique way for people to learn about the mission and resources of the U.S. Department of Labor."" Work, like our nation, is constantly evolving, and so Books that Shaped Work in America (link is external) is no different. To get it started, 24 individuals, including Perez, eight former secretaries of labor from both Democratic and Republican administrations, department staff (including an intern), civil rights leaders, critics, authors, media personalities and staff from the Library of Congress submitted suggestions. Among the contributors: former Secretaries of Labor George P. Shultz and Robert Reich, authors Daniel H. Pink and Joan Acocella, Solicitor of Labor M.

Their recommendations are included on the initiative's website, along with brief summaries of each book and links to related U.S. Department of Labor resources.

""From a simple tale for children like ' The Day the Crayons Quit ' to a scholarly tome like ' Quality, Productivity and Competitive Position, ' the books on the list demonstrate the rich breadth and depth of work in America,"" said Carl Fillichio, the department's senior adviser for public affairs and chair of its Centennial. ""As we continue to mark the Department of Labor's 100 years of service to workers in our country, this project is a terrific way to educate the public about work, workers and the work of the Labor Department. Watching the list grow, and hearing the discussion broaden, is going to be very exciting."" Read Fillichio's Get Out Your Work Books (link is external) blog post. The project was inspired by the Center for the Book in the Library of Congress' (link is external) 2012 Books That Shaped America exhibition (link is external) , which explored the impact of books on American life and culture.

Custer, will pay two Ohio truck drivers $302,000 to resolve a lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Labor for terminating two of the company's drivers in violation of the 1982 Surface Transportation Assistance Act's whistleblower provisions. Akron Reserve Ammunition Inc., was also named a defendant in the lawsuit because the department alleges that the company, which is owned by Custer, is the successor to Star Air. ""These drivers were fired for trying to protect themselves and the driving public,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health Dr. David Michaels. ""No truck driver should be forced to drive while tired, sick or in violation of truck weight or hours-of-service requirements. OSHA will continue to defend America's truck drivers against unscrupulous employers who unlawfully retaliate against drivers who assert their right to drive safely."" The drivers were dismissed after one was stopped by West Virginia State Police and cited for: hauling an excess load without a commercial driver's license, operating an overweight trailer and driving without a logbook. The commercial vehicle also did not have the name of the company, its home base or its U.S. Department of Transportation number displayed. The driver who was cited informed another driver, who was also operating without the proper information displayed, and they refused to continue driving until these issues were resolved. Consequently, both were terminated. Both drivers filed complaints with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration alleging that Star Air had discriminated against them in retaliation for activities protected by the STAA, and a Labor Department administrative law judge issued the order for reinstatement and back wages. Under automatic review provisions, the judge's decision then was referred to and upheld by the Administrative Review Board, which issues final decisions for the secretary of labor in cases arising under a wide range of worker protection laws. The companies and Custer will pay the $302,000 agreed upon amount over a three-year period. If any party defaults on payments, the court can order the payment of the entire amount awarded in the judgment, which is $685,785.22. The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, Eastern Division, in Akron made the ruling. The department is represented by its Regional Office of the Solicitor in Cleveland. OSHA enforces the whistleblower provisions of the STAA and 21 other statutes protecting employees who report violations of various airline, commercial motor carrier, consumer product, environmental, financial reform, food safety, motor vehicle safety, health-care reform, nuclear, pipeline, public transportation agency, railroad, maritime and securities laws. Under the various whistleblower provisions enacted by Congress, employers are prohibited from retaliating against employees who raise various protected concerns or provide protected information to the employer or the government. Employees who believe that they have been retaliated against for engaging in protected conduct may file a complaint with the secretary of labor for an investigation by OSHA's Whistleblower Protection Program. More information is available at http://www.whistleblowers.gov . Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. OSHA's role is to ensure these conditions for America's working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education and assistance.

Custer, will pay two Ohio truck drivers $302,000 to resolve a lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Labor for terminating two of the company's drivers in violation of the 1982 Surface Transportation Assistance Act's whistleblower provisions. Akron Reserve Ammunition Inc., was also named a defendant in the lawsuit because the department alleges that the company, which is owned by Custer, is the successor to Star Air. ""These drivers were fired for trying to protect themselves and the driving public,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health Dr. David Michaels. ""No truck driver should be forced to drive while tired, sick or in violation of truck weight or hours-of-service requirements. OSHA will continue to defend America's truck drivers against unscrupulous employers who unlawfully retaliate against drivers who assert their right to drive safely."" The drivers were dismissed after one was stopped by West Virginia State Police and cited for: hauling an excess load without a commercial driver's license, operating an overweight trailer and driving without a logbook. The commercial vehicle also did not have the name of the company, its home base or its U.S. Department of Transportation number displayed. The driver who was cited informed another driver, who was also operating without the proper information displayed, and they refused to continue driving until these issues were resolved. Consequently, both were terminated. Both drivers filed complaints with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration alleging that Star Air had discriminated against them in retaliation for activities protected by the STAA, and a Labor Department administrative law judge issued the order for reinstatement and back wages. Under automatic review provisions, the judge's decision then was referred to and upheld by the Administrative Review Board, which issues final decisions for the secretary of labor in cases arising under a wide range of worker protection laws. The companies and Custer will pay the $302,000 agreed upon amount over a three-year period. If any party defaults on payments, the court can order the payment of the entire amount awarded in the judgment, which is $685,785.22. The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, Eastern Division, in Akron made the ruling. The department is represented by its Regional Office of the Solicitor in Cleveland. OSHA enforces the whistleblower provisions of the STAA and 21 other statutes protecting employees who report violations of various airline, commercial motor carrier, consumer product, environmental, financial reform, food safety, motor vehicle safety, health-care reform, nuclear, pipeline, public transportation agency, railroad, maritime and securities laws. Under the various whistleblower provisions enacted by Congress, employers are prohibited from retaliating against employees who raise various protected concerns or provide protected information to the employer or the government. Employees who believe that they have been retaliated against for engaging in protected conduct may file a complaint with the secretary of labor for an investigation by OSHA's Whistleblower Protection Program. More information is available at http://www.whistleblowers.gov . Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. OSHA's role is to ensure these conditions for America's working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education and assistance.

"November 19, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20131119,ETA News Release: Youth CareerConnect Grants [11/19/2013],"WASHINGTON — To compete in today's global economy, America's students need deep knowledge and skills that will prepare them for college and the jobs of the future. Yet far too many of America's students are not meaningfully engaged or motivated in their academic experience while in high school. Many high school graduates lack exposure to learning that links their work in school to college and careers — especially in the critically important fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). Moreover, many of America's international competitors offer students a more rigorous and relevant education in their middle and high school years. In his 2013 State of the Union address, the President laid out a new vision for America's high schools, proposing funding to scale up innovative high school models and partnerships with colleges and employers so that all students graduate better equipped for the demands of a high-tech economy. Today's global economy requires new approaches to teaching and learning in America's high schools to foster problem solving and analysis, to support creativity and collaboration, and to connect student learning directly to the real world. A 21st century education and workforce system must challenge students to do meaningful work inside and outside of the classroom, encouraging the persistence, engagement and achievement that will put all students on track for college and careers. Today, as part of achieving the President's goal of redesigning high schools to ensure students are prepared to succeed in post-secondary education and in a competitive workforce, the U.S. Department of Labor is collaborating with the U.S. Department of Education to make $100 million available for Youth CareerConnect grants to provide high school students with the industry-relevant education and skills they need for a successful future. The Youth CareerConnect grant program is designed to encourage America's school districts, institutions of higher education, the workforce investment system and their partners to scale-up evidence-based high school models that will transform the high school experience for America's youth. Youth CareerConnect schools will strengthen America's talent pipeline through: Integrated Academic and Career-Focused Learning : Grants will provide students with education and training that combines rigorous academic and career-focused curriculum to increase students' employability in in-demand industries and prepare them for employment, post-secondary education, long-term occupational skills training or registered apprenticeships. Work-Based Learning and Exposure to the World of Work: Strong partnerships will provide work-based learning opportunities. In addition to actual work experience, youth participants will also participate in field trips, job-shadowing or other types of opportunities that provide students with exposure to different career paths and prepare them for the world of work. Robust Employer Engagement: Employer partners will provide work-based learning and mentoring, creating a path for students to in-demand industries and occupations including those in information technologies, advanced manufacturing and other science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) fields. Employers will also work closely with schools on professional development and training for staff to drive the sustainability of the program over the long term. Individualized Career and Academic Counseling: As an integral part of the program design, students will be provided with individualized career and academic counseling experiences to strengthen their career and post-secondary awareness and explore opportunities beyond high school. Integration of Post-secondary Education and Training: Students will participate in education and training, while they are still in high school, that leads to credit toward a post-secondary degree or certificate and an industry recognized credential, where appropriate. The Department of Labor will use up to $100 million in revenues from the H-1B visa program to fund approximately 25 to 40 grants for individual or multisite projects. Grants will be awarded to local education agencies, public or nonprofit local workforce entities, or nonprofits with education reform experience. All grantees will have to demonstrate a strong public/private partnership, and must include, at a minimum, a local education agency, a local workforce investment system entity, an employer and an institution of higher education. Applicants are encouraged to reach out to employers, foundations and others in building their applications and leveraging the federal investment. At a minimum, applicants will also be required to provide a match of 25 percent of the grant award. Awards are anticipated to be made in early 2014 for program implementation to align with the 2014-15 school year. This announcement builds on the President's broader agenda to strengthen education to better prepare young people for college and careers: The Administration's efforts to redesign high schools were unveiled in the 2013 State of the Union address and FY2014 Budget Proposal, in which the President called for $300 million in new funding at the Department of Education to transform the high school experience for America's youth through a whole school redesign effort. This effort, currently before Congress, would challenge high schools and their partners to re-think teaching and learning and put in place learning models that are rigorous, relevant and better focused on real-world experiences. Today's announcement also builds on ongoing efforts by the U.S. Department of Education to reform America's Career and Technical Education system through a reauthorized Perkins Career and Technical Education (CTE) Act, aiming to leverage change in the federal government's $1 billion investment each year to usher in a new era of rigorous, relevant and results-driven CTE programs.

"November 18, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20131118-0,US Labor Department files suit against former chief executive of Baltimore Behavioral Health to restore employee retirement plan contributions,"BALTIMORE – The U.S. Department of Labor has sued William Kristen Hathaway, former chief executive officer of Baltimore Behavioral Health Inc. and fiduciary to the company’s retirement plan, for failing to remit employee contributions, in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The suit resulted from an investigation by the Washington District Office of the department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration. The investigation found that from October 2009 through April 2010, Hathaway failed to remit employee contributions to the plan, remitted certain employee contributions late without interest and failed to segregate the plan’s assets from the general assets of the company. “The defendant’s failure to properly remit these contributions clearly demonstrates a breach of fiduciary duty,” said Marc Machiz, EBSA’s regional administrator in Philadelphia. “This case underscores our commitment to hold fiduciaries accountable when they fail to act in the best interests of plan participants.” Filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, the suit seeks to restore to the plan all losses, including interest and opportunity costs, and to appoint an independent fiduciary with the authority to manage and administer the plan. The suit also seeks to permanently bar Hathaway from serving in a fiduciary capacity to any employee benefit plan covered by ERISA and to cover the cost of the independent fiduciary. Baltimore Behavioral Health is a provider of mental health and drug treatment services. Employers and workers can reach EBSA’s Washington District Office at (202) 693-8700 or toll-free at 866-444-3272 for help with problems relating to private sector retirement and health plans.

"November 18, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20131118,US Labor Department files suit to recover funds for participants in Milwaukee-based Omni Resources Employee Stock Ownership Plan,"MILWAUKEE – The U.S. Department of Labor has filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court to recover funds from the fiduciaries of Omni Resources Inc., a Milwaukee-based information technology company. The suit alleges that Omni Resources’ plan fiduciaries authorized the sale of the company’s stock to the Omni Resources Employee Stock Ownership Plan for $13.7 million, which far exceeded its fair market value. The sale resulted in personal financial gain to company owner Veronica Mueller, who was also a fiduciary to the plan. “When fiduciaries are responsible for retirement plan assets, they have to act with undivided loyalty to the plan participants and make sure that the plan receives full value for its money,” said Donna Seermon, Employee Benefits Security Administration’s acting regional director in Chicago. “The department is committed to making sure employees receive their rightful benefits.” The investigation, by the Chicago Regional Office of the department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration, focused on a December 2008 ESOP stock purchase. The suit names Mueller, who owned 40 percent of Omni Resources’ stock, and husband Roger Mueller, who founded the company in 1984. The Muellers were the only members of Omni’s board of directors and were also the plan trustees at the time of the transaction. The remaining 60 percent of the company’s stock was held in a trust for each of their three children. The trusts are also named defendants in the lawsuit because of the stock sold by each. Milwaukee-based Alpha Investment Consulting Group, which executed the stock purchase agreement as a special fiduciary to the ESOP, has also been named as a defendant for failing to protect the interests of the plan. The suit seeks to require the fiduciaries to restore all losses suffered by the ESOP, and to require the defendants to restore all profits and financial benefits received by them. At the time of the stock sale, Omni Resources employed approximately 212 information technology consultants and operated branches in Appleton, Madison and Milwaukee, as well as Minneapolis, Minn. The company provides information technology staffing options. After conducting its investigation, the department concluded that, as a result of the design of the transactions and the fiduciary breaches of the Muellers and Alpha Investment Consulting Group, the stock purchases were not for the primary benefit of participants and did not promote employee ownership of Omni Resources. As a result, the department concluded that the Muellers and Alpha Investment Consulting Group were responsible and liable for violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The lawsuit also seeks to remove the Muellers and Alpha Investment Consulting Group as fiduciaries and service providers of the ESOP and to permanently bar them from serving as fiduciaries or service providers to ERISA-covered plans in the future. As of Dec. 31, 2012, the most recent Form 5500 filing, the plan had 83 active and 113 total participants and assets of $1,761,490. For help with problems related to private sector retirement and health plans, employers and workers can reach EBSA’s Chicago office at (312) 353-0900 or toll-free at 866-444-3272.

This year marks the fifth year anniversary of the death of a worker killed upon opening a large store for an after-Thanksgiving Day Black Friday sales event. In 2008, the worker was trampled to death when shoppers rushed through the store entrance to take advantage of the holiday sales. Retailers can avoid similar tragedies through crowd management and safety precautions. ""The busy shopping season should not put retail workers at risk of being injured or killed,"" said Dr. David Michaels, assistant secretary of labor for occupational safety and health. ""OSHA urges retailers to take the time to adopt a crowd management plan and follow a few simple guidelines to prevent unnecessary harm to retail employees."" OSHA sent letters to major retailers as well as retail and fire associations nationwide reminding employers and fire chiefs about the potential hazards involved with large crowds at retail stores during the holiday season when sales events attract a higher number of shoppers. Retailers are encouraged to use the safety guidelines provided in the OSHA fact sheet they received, "" Crowd Management Safety Guidelines for Retailers ,"" in addition to their own procedures. They were also reminded to maintain appropriate access to exit routes and ensure that exits are not blocked. Crowd management plans should, at least, include: On-site trained security personnel or police officers. Barricades or rope lines for pedestrians that do not start right in front of the store's entrance. The implementation of crowd control measures well in advance of customers arriving at the store. Emergency procedures in place to address potential dangers. Methods for explaining approach and entrance procedures to the arriving public. Not allowing additional customers to enter the store when it reaches its maximum occupancy level. Not blocking or locking exit doors. The fact sheet outlining these and other safety measures is available at https://www.osha.gov/OshDoc/data_General_Facts/Crowd_Control.html .

Campbell Construction was demolishing the four-story building known as the ""Hoagie City"" building adjacent to the Salvation Army Thrift Store, located at the 2100 block of Market Street in Philadelphia. S&R Contracting was operating the building's interior walls and floors. ""Campbell Construction and S&R Contracting sacrificed worker and public safety through the deliberate neglect of demolition safety fundamentals,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health Dr. David Michaels. ""This tragic incident could and should have been prevented."" OSHA found several violations of OSHA's demolition construction standards. On the three days leading up to the collapse, Campbell Construction removed critical, structural supports for the wall that collapsed. The OSHA demolition standards prohibit the removal of lateral support walls more than one story high, leaving the wall unsupported. Campbell Construction also removed parts of the lower floors prior to the removal of the upper floors, again, contrary to the OSHA standards. Campbell Construction also failed to provide an engineering survey as promised. As a result, Campbell Construction has been cited for three willful, egregious violations for each day that it left the wall without sufficient lateral support, and two willful violations alleging the failures to demolish the building from the top down and to have an engineering survey by a competent person on the possibility of collapse prior to starting the demolition. S&R Contracting has been cited for one willful violation. A willful violation is one committed with intentional, knowing or voluntary disregard for the law's requirements, or with plain indifference to worker safety and health. Additionally, Campbell Construction was cited for serious violations for the company's failures to provide: employees with hard hats when there was a possible risk of head injury; fall protection for employees working on surfaces at least six feet high; training on fall hazards; and adequate personal fall arrest systems. Campbell Construction also failed to inspect all stairs periodically and to maintain them in a clean, safe condition. S&R Contracting was cited for two serious violations for failing to protect employees from falling through holes and to provide fall hazard training. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known if an accident were to occur. The citations can be viewed below http://www.osha.gov/ooc/citations/CampbellConstruction90726711112013.pdf http://www.osha.gov/ooc/citations/SeanBenschop_dbaS_RContracting91698111142013.pdf OSHA proposed penalties of $313,000 for Campbell Construction and $84,000 for S&R Contracting. Both companies have 15 business days from receipt of the citations to comply, request an informal conference with the OSHA area director in Philadelphia, or contest the citations and proposed penalties before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.

"November 14, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20132165,OSHA News Release: Philadelphia demolition contractors cited by US Labor Department's OSHA for willful and serious safety violations following fatal June building collapse [11/14/2013],"PHILADELPHIA — The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration today cited Griffin Campbell, doing business as Campbell Construction, and Sean Benschop, doing business as S&R Contracting, for safety violations, including three willful per-instance violations, following the June 5, 2013, building collapse that killed six people and injured 14. Campbell Construction was demolishing the four-story building known as the ""Hoagie City"" building adjacent to the Salvation Army Thrift Store, located at the 2100 block of Market Street in Philadelphia. S&R Contracting was operating the building's interior walls and floors. ""Campbell Construction and S&R Contracting sacrificed worker and public safety through the deliberate neglect of demolition safety fundamentals,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health Dr. David Michaels. ""This tragic incident could and should have been prevented."" OSHA found several violations of OSHA's demolition construction standards. On the three days leading up to the collapse, Campbell Construction removed critical, structural supports for the wall that collapsed. The OSHA demolition standards prohibit the removal of lateral support walls more than one story high, leaving the wall unsupported. Campbell Construction also removed parts of the lower floors prior to the removal of the upper floors, again, contrary to the OSHA standards. Campbell Construction also failed to provide an engineering survey as promised. As a result, Campbell Construction has been cited for three willful, egregious violations for each day that it left the wall without sufficient lateral support, and two willful violations alleging the failures to demolish the building from the top down and to have an engineering survey by a competent person on the possibility of collapse prior to starting the demolition. S&R Contracting has been cited for one willful violation. A willful violation is one committed with intentional, knowing or voluntary disregard for the law's requirements, or with plain indifference to worker safety and health. Additionally, Campbell Construction was cited for serious violations for the company's failures to provide: employees with hard hats when there was a possible risk of head injury; fall protection for employees working on surfaces at least six feet high; training on fall hazards; and adequate personal fall arrest systems. Campbell Construction also failed to inspect all stairs periodically and to maintain them in a clean, safe condition. S&R Contracting was cited for two serious violations for failing to protect employees from falling through holes and to provide fall hazard training. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known if an accident were to occur. The citations can be viewed below http://www.osha.gov/ooc/citations/CampbellConstruction90726711112013.pdf http://www.osha.gov/ooc/citations/SeanBenschop_dbaS_RContracting91698111142013.pdf OSHA proposed penalties of $313,000 for Campbell Construction and $84,000 for S&R Contracting. Both companies have 15 business days from receipt of the citations to comply, request an informal conference with the OSHA area director in Philadelphia, or contest the citations and proposed penalties before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.

"November 14, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20132126,"ETA News Release: New online resources to promote the expansion of short-time compensation, or work-sharing, programs nationwide announced by US Labor Department [11/14/2013]","WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Labor today announced a new online resource that provides guidance and information to states interested in developing or improving short-time compensation programs, also known as work-sharing. The STC program is designed to avert employee layoffs for businesses faced with a temporary slowdown in business activity. The online resources, which will be available to state workforce agencies, state policymakers and the general public, are located at: https://stc.workforce3one.org . ""I encourage every state to consider establishing or expanding a work-sharing program so that business owners have an additional tool they can use to weather hard economic times while still keeping their existing skilled employees,"" said Eric M. Seleznow, acting assistant secretary of labor for employment and training. ""The information the Labor Department has made available online will make it easier for states to develop a program that fits the specific needs of their local workers and employers."" The STC program is an alternative to layoffs for employers faced with a reduction in available work. Employers can reduce work hours for a group of workers rather than laying off one or more workers. Employees affected by a reduction of hours can collect a percentage of their unemployment benefits to replace a portion of their lost wages. This is a win-win situation both for employers and employees. Employees' jobs — and benefits — are preserved while participating in an STC program, and employers get to maintain their skilled and trained workforce without having to rehire and retrain new workers when business activity increases. The new website provides helpful tools that can be used to expand STC education and outreach to states and the public. The website includes guidance and model legislation for states interested in developing an STC program. The site also offers a compendium of state practices, outreach efforts, operational tools and vignettes from STC participants (employers and employees) who have benefitted from the program. View the video (link is external) The department encourages states to take advantage of federal financial incentives for states with active STC programs, available for only a limited time. The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 provided for 100 percent reimbursement of STC benefits for states with conforming STC programs through Aug. 22, 2015. States with conforming STC programs are also eligible for grants to support the implementation or improved administration of the STC program and to promote and enroll employers in the program. Applications for grants must be received by Dec. 31, 2014. Technical assistance is available from the department to help states develop their grant applications.

Both sides recognized advances made by Colombia under the Action Plan to date, while underscoring several areas of mutual concern. These areas of concern include: the collection of fines imposed for labor violations; targeted inspections in the five identified priority sectors (palm oil, sugar, mines, ports and flowers); the investigation and sanction of all forms of abusive contracting; the status of hiring labor inspectors in line with Action Plan commitments; and violence and threats against trade unionists and continued impunity for the perpetrators. ""The agreement to continue meeting on Action Plan obligations reflects the joint commitment of the United States and Colombia to full implementation of the Action Plan,"" said Harris. ""Together, we must fulfill the commitments agreed upon in 2011. We look forward to continuing to work with Colombia to make these promises a reality for workers."" The agreement reached specifies two technical-level meetings and one meeting of senior officials in 2014, with any future meetings to be agreed upon mutually.

"November 8, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20132159,OPA News Release: Statement of Labor Secretary Perez on October employment numbers [11/08/2013],"WASHINGTON — U.S. Secretary of Labor Thomas E. Perez issued the following statement about the October 2013 Employment Situation report released today: ""The American economy is resilient. Today's jobs report demonstrates continued steady growth, with the addition of 212,000 total private sector jobs in October. The unemployment rate, which fell in September to a nearly-five year low of 7.2 percent, remains essentially unchanged at 7.3 percent, while American manufacturers added 19,000 jobs in the month of October. ""But while American businesses continue to add jobs — 7.8 million over the last 44 months of private sector job growth — they do so in spite of Congress, not because of it. October's job growth was undoubtedly restrained by the brinksmanship and uncertainty created by the federal government shutdown and the near-default on the nation's debt. ""The American economy is resilient, but it is not immune to manufactured crises. We see signs that suggest the shutdown had a discouraging effect on America's continued recovery. We remain concerned about the drop in the labor force participation rate, and American workers on temporary layoffs rose by nearly 448,000, the largest monthly increase in the history of that series of data. ""The American people deserve leadership that focuses on growing the economy, not holding it hostage. Let's keep our eye on the ball by passing immigration reform, which has bipartisan support and would inject a trillion dollars into the economy, and investing in infrastructure upgrades that would create thousands of middle class jobs right now. Instead of erecting political roadblocks, let's work together to pave bipartisan roads to full recovery. ""Today's employment numbers are a reminder that while the economy continues to grow and create new jobs, it remains on uncertain footing. Too many Americans still find the rungs on the ladder of opportunity beyond their reach. We need to move forward with common-sense proposals that will create jobs, strengthen the middle class, reduce our deficit and expand opportunity for American families. The President and I stand ready to work with Congress to do just that."""
"November 8, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20132158,EBSA News Release: Administration issues final mental health and substance use disorder parity rule [11/08/2013],"WASHINGTON — The Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services and the Treasury today jointly issued a final rule increasing parity between mental health/substance use disorder benefits and medical/surgical benefits in group and individual health plans. The final rule issued today implements the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act, and ensures that health plan features like copays, deductibles and visits limits are generally not more restrictive for mental health/substance abuse disorders benefits than they are for medical/surgical benefits. Today's action also includes specific additional consumer protections, such as: Ensuring that parity applies to intermediate levels of care received in residential treatment or intensive outpatient settings; Clarifying the scope of the transparency required by health plans, including the disclosure rights of plan participants, to ensure compliance with the law; Clarifying that parity applies to all plan standards, including geographic limits, facility-type limits and network adequacy; and Eliminating an exception to the existing parity rule that was determined to be confusing, unnecessary and open to abuse. By issuing this rule, the administration has now completed or made significant progress on all 23 executive actions included in the President and Vice President's plan to reduce gun violence. An updated report summarizing the status of all 23 executive actions is available here: http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/dolgov/files/legacy-files/docs/november_exec_actions_progress_report_final.pdf (link is external) . In January, as part of the President and Vice President's plan to reduce gun violence, the administration committed to finalize this rule as part of a larger effort to increase access to affordable mental health services and reduce the misinformation associated with mental illness. As the President and Vice President have made clear, mental illness should no longer be treated by our society — or covered by insurance companies — differently from other illnesses. The Affordable Care Act builds on the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act and requires coverage of mental health and substance use disorder services as one of ten essential health benefits categories. Under the essential health benefits rule, individual and small group health plans are required to comply with these parity regulations. ""New efforts are underway to expand coverage to the millions of Americans who have lacked access to affordable treatment for mental and substance use disorders,"" said Labor Secretary Thomas E. Perez. ""These rules will increase access to mental health and substance abuse treatment, prohibit discriminatory practices and increase health plan transparency. Ultimately, they'll provide greater opportunities for affordable, accessible, effective treatment to Americans who need it."" ""This final rule breaks down barriers that stand in the way of treatment and recovery services for millions of Americans,"" said Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. ""Building on these rules, the Affordable Care Act is expanding mental health and substance use disorder benefits and parity protections to 62 million Americans. This historic expansion will help make treatment more affordable and accessible."" ""Americans deserve access to coverage for mental health and substance use disorders that is on par with medical and surgical care,"" said Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew. ""These rules mark an important step in ending the disparities that exist in insurance plans, and will provide families nationwide with critical coverage and protections that fulfill their health needs."" The final Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act rule was developed based on the departments' review of more than 5,400 public comments on the interim final rules issued in 2010.

The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, Eastern Division in Cleveland, alleges improper use of pension funds and seeks to restore $123,338.85 to the plan. An investigation by the department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration found the plan’s fiduciaries failed to remit participant contributions and loan repayments withheld from paychecks to the retirement plan, in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. “People entrusted with workers’ retirement plans must be held accountable when they fail to uphold that trust,” said Joe Rivers, director of EBSA’s Cincinnati Regional Office, which conducted the investigation. “We at the department are committed to helping workers obtain their rightful benefits when plan fiduciaries violate the law.” The complaint alleges that Cirric Inc., as the successor to Averrock Inc. and Attevo Inc., and its sister company, Ruralogic Inc., are fiduciaries to the Attevo 401(k) retirement plan, along with two of the companies’ owners, C. David Snyder and Joseph Burmester. All are named as defendants in the suit. Snyder and Cirric Inc. allegedly failed to remit $68,439.14 in participant contributions and participant loan repayments that were withheld from the paychecks of Cirric Inc.’s employees to the plan for the period of Jan. 31, 2009, through July 2, 2012. Burmester and Ruralogic Inc. allegedly failed to remit $54,899.71 in participant contributions that were withheld from the paychecks of Ruralogic Inc.’s employees to the plan from July 31, 2010, to June 29, 2012. The investigation determined, that from Jan. 1, 2009, through July 2, 2012, Snyder, Burmester, Cirric Inc., and Ruralogic Inc. failed to timely remit participant contributions and participant loan repayments to the plan. In addition, the complaint alleges that Cirric Inc. failed to administer the participant loan program, resulting in a defaulted participant loan. Finally, Cirric Inc. also failed to maintain a fidelity bond. The complaint seeks the restoration of all losses to the plan, including the $123,338.85 in unremitted participant contributions and participant loan repayments, plus lost opportunity costs. Further, the complaint seeks to permanently bar Snyder and Burmester from serving as a fiduciary or service provider to any ERISA-covered employee benefit plan, and asks that the court appoint an independent fiduciary to terminate the plan. As of Aug. 13, 2013, the plan had 24 participants and $379,424.20 in assets.

The announcement follows the Bureau of Labor Statistics' release of its annual Occupational Injuries and Illnesses report, which estimates that three million workers were injured on the job in 2012. ""Three million injuries are three million too many,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health Dr. David Michaels. ""With the changes being proposed in this rule, employers, employees, the government and researchers will have better access to data that will encourage earlier abatement of hazards and result in improved programs to reduce workplace hazards and prevent injuries, illnesses and fatalities. The proposal does not add any new requirement to keep records; it only modifies an employer's obligation to transmit these records to OSHA."" The public will have 90 days, through Feb. 6, 2014, to submit written comments on the proposed rule. On Jan. 9, 2014, OSHA will hold a public meeting on the proposed rule in Washington, D.C. A Federal Register notice announcing the public meeting will be published shortly. The proposed rule was developed following a series of stakeholder meetings in 2010 to help OSHA gather information about electronic submission of establishment-specific injury and illness data. OSHA is proposing to amend its current recordkeeping regulations to add requirements for the electronic submission of injury and illness information employers are already required to keep under existing standards, Part 1904. The first proposed new requirement is for establishments with more than 250 employees (and who are already required to keep records) to electronically submit the records on a quarterly basis to OSHA. OSHA is also proposing that establishments with 20 or more employees, in certain industries with high injury and illness rates, be required to submit electronically only their summary of work-related injuries and illnesses to OSHA once a year. Currently, many such firms report this information to OSHA under OSHA's Data Initiative. OSHA plans to eventually post the data online, as encouraged by President Obama's Open Government Initiative (link is external) . Timely, establishment-specific injury and illness data will help OSHA target its compliance assistance and enforcement resources more effectively by identifying workplaces where workers are at greater risk, and enable employers to compare their injury rates with others in the same industry. Additional information on the proposed rule can be found at http://www.dol.gov/find/20131107/ and http://www.osha.gov/recordkeeping/proposed_data_form.html .

From July 1 to Sept. 30, there were nine mining fatalities in the United States. Five miners died in coal mining accidents and four in metal/nonmetal mining accidents. The number was two fewer than during the third quarter in 2012. Two coal miners died in machinery accidents, and one each died in powered haulage, fall of roof or rib, and drowning accidents. Two metal/nonmetal miners died in powered haulage accidents, and one each died in machinery and falling/sliding material accidents. Twenty-seven miners died in mining accidents in 2013 from Jan. 1 through Sept. 30, compared to 30 from Jan. 1, 2012, through Sept. 30, 2012. ""While the number of mining deaths was lower than in the same period last year, miners continue to die in accidents that could have been prevented, such as by using proximity detection equipment,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. On July 2, a continuous mining machine operator was killed when he was struck by a battery-powered coal hauler and pinned between the coal hauler and coal rib. Proximity detection systems can be programmed to send warning signals to alert miners to the presence of moving machinery and can stop the machinery before it strikes, pins or crushes a miner working in the vicinity. As of Sept. 30, 2013, 372 proximity detection systems had been installed on continuous mining machines, coal hauling machines and scoops in underground coal mines. ""In metal/nonmetal mining, fatalities continue to occur that could be prevented by using ‘lock out/tag out' best practices,"" said Main. ""Two of the fatalities this quarter could have been avoided by: disconnecting the power, ensuring the miner on the job has locked the power source in the safe position and tagging to prevent the power from being re-energized. ""While actions undertaken by MSHA and the mining industry continue to move mine safety in the right direction, these deaths are a reminder that much more needs to be done to protect the nation's miners and ensure they return home after every shift,"" said Main.

STC programs allow employers to reduce work hours for a group of employees as an alternative to layoffs during tough economic times. With STC, workers affected by reduced hours have their lowered wages supplemented by a percentage of the weekly unemployment compensation that would have been available to them had they been laid off entirely. This is a win-win program: employees keep their jobs — and benefits, such as employer-based retirement and health insurance — while employers maintain their skilled workforce and avoid having to hire and train new workers when business activity increases. This approach eases the strain on local economies, which acutely feel the impact of layoffs. ""Providing employers with tools like short-time compensation to retain their skilled workers during temporary business downturns is good for local communities, the state and the overall national economy,"" said U.S. Secretary of Labor Thomas E.

""Michigan is leading by example by instituting this innovative program, and I encourage all states to take advantage of the federal resources that are available to start or expand programs of their own."" Michigan will allocate $946,845 of the available funds to implement its new STC program, while the remaining $1,893,690 will go toward educating the public about the advantages of STC, promoting the program and increasing enrollment of employers into the program.

SUPERVALU, which was one of the largest grocery wholesalers and retailers in the United States, sold several of its retail sites in 2013, significantly reducing the size of the company.

The conciliation agreement between the federal contractor's facility located in Santa Fe Springs, Calif., and the department's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs resolves this pay discrimination violation, as well as the related finding that the company discriminated against male applicants in hiring. ""The settlement reflects a mutual commitment between the department and the leadership of G&K Services Co. to ensure that qualified workers, irrespective of gender, have a fair shot at competing for good jobs,"" said OFCCP Director Patricia A. Shiu. ""I am pleased by this contractor's willingness to work with us on a proactive strategy to guarantee that all their workers have an equal opportunity to succeed in the workplace."" During a compliance evaluation, OFCCP determined that G&K Services had a practice of assigning laundry workers to different tasks and different pay rates on the basis of gender. Specifically, OFCCP found that between July 1, 2009, and June 30, 2010, female employees who had been hired as general laborers were assigned to ""light duty"" jobs that paid less than the ""heavy duty"" jobs involving similar work and qualifications, which the company reserved for men. Denying women access to higher-paying opportunities because of sex stereotyping is a form of pay discrimination in violation of Executive Order 11246. Investigators also found that male applicants were frequently denied the option to compete for a majority of the open laborer opportunities during the review period because the company only considered them for so-called heavy duty work. Under the terms of the agreement, the contractor will pay $265,983 in back wages to 59 female workers who were steered into the lower paying jobs. G&K Services will also extend to the 59 female class members job offers in the higher-paying laborer positions. In addition, G&K Services will pay $23,968 in back wages to 331 male job applicants who were denied the opportunity to compete for open lower-paying laborer positions and make three job offers. The company has also agreed to undertake extensive self-monitoring measures, and review and revise their hiring and pay practices, to ensure they fully comply with the law. G&K Services provides textile leasing and renting services to a number of different government agencies, including the Defense Commissary Agency, Bureau of Reclamation and NASA. In addition to Executive Order 11246, OFCCP enforces Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974.

"October 31, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20132103,MSHA News Release: MSHA announces results of September impact inspections [10/31/2013],"ARLINGTON, Va. — The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration today announced that federal inspectors issued 130 citations and 13 orders during special impact inspections conducted at nine coal mines and one metal/nonmetal mine last month. The monthly inspections, which began in force in April 2010 following the explosion at the Upper Big Branch Mine, involve mines that merit increased agency attention and enforcement due to their poor compliance history or particular compliance concerns. These matters include: high numbers of violations or closure orders; frequent hazard complaints or hotline calls; plan compliance issues; inadequate workplace examinations; a high number of accidents, injuries or illnesses; fatalities; adverse conditions, such as increased methane liberation, faulty roof conditions, inadequate ventilation and accumulations of respirable dust. On Sept. 17, an impact inspection was conducted during the evening shift at Red River Coal Co.'s No. 1 Prep Plant in Wise County, Va. The mine phone and radio communications systems were monitored to prevent the possibility of advance notification to mine personnel. MSHA personnel inspected the preparation plant and loadout facility and issued 25 104(a) citations and 13 104(d)(2) orders. This is the first impact inspection of this mine. Inspectors cited the operator for failure to conduct adequate on-shift examinations and to record, report and correct hazardous conditions. Inadequate examinations allowed existing hazards to continue, thereby exposing miners to potentially serious accidents. MSHA inspectors cited numerous hazardous conditions that should have been identified, recorded and corrected. The violations pointed to management's inattention to safety precautions and lack of maintenance at the preparation plant and loadout facility. The area within 25 feet of a utility pole and the area surrounding a 200-gallon bulk diesel storage tank in the raw coal dump area were not kept free of combustible materials, posing a fire risk. Fire extinguishers in the raw coal dump were not examined within the last six months. Guarding on a conveyor was not secured and exposed personnel to moving machine parts that could result in serious bodily injury, amputations or death. Inspectors found a metal walkway with holes through which a miner could fall into coal stockpile below. The escapeway for the clean coal tunnel was not maintained. A 72-inch section of the escapeway bottom and a 43-inch section on the escapeway floor were rusted through with sharp edges. These conditions created slips, trips and falls hazards. Refuse materials and washed coal were allowed to accumulate up to 3 inches deep and 14 feet wide along the entire width of the walkway behind the transfer belt. The risk of fire and coal dust explosions caused great concern at the loadout facility. Inspectors found thick coatings of coal dust accumulated all around the inside of the loadout tunnel escapeway and the ventilation pipe connecting the escapeway and the loadout tunnel. The top clean coal loadout reclaim tunnel had coal accumulations up to 3 inches deep underneath and along the backside of the belt and 1 inch deep around the tail drive roller guards and on the belt structure. Since April 2010, MSHA has conducted 666 impact inspections and issued 11,133 citations, 1,031 orders and 46 safeguards.

"October 31, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20132098,MSHA News Release: MSHA issues warning to coal mine operators about winter hazards [10/31/2013],"ARLINGTON, Va. — The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration this week launched its annual ""Winter Alert"" campaign, which warns coal mine operators and miners of the numerous hazards colder winter weather may cause for working miners. Statistics show that deadly mine explosions historically occur more often during October through March than during warmer periods. ""During winter, everyone in our industry needs to be more alert to changes brought on by cold and icy weather conditions,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""Operators of underground coal mines need to be fully aware of the precautions they can take to avoid tragic accidents at their mine sites, and these include thorough examinations, sufficient ventilation, adequate rock dusting and maintaining escape routes."" MSHA emphasizes these four critical remedies for keeping mining operations safe during winter months. Colder air brings low barometric pressures and low humidity to the mine environment. Coupled with seasonal drying of surfaces on the mine roofs, ribs and bottom, this fosters conditions conducive to propagating an explosion. Colder weather also creates an environment for other potential hazards, such as icy walkways and haulage roads, limited visibility, and freezing and thawing of highwalls, which causes instability. This winter, during regular inspections, MSHA inspectors will educate mine operators about the importance of thorough mine examinations, sufficient ventilation, and the importance of generous rock dusting to neutralize and stop potential coal dust explosions. ""We can significantly reduce the probability of tragic mining accidents during winter months when all mine operators heed these simple — but important — precautions,"" said Main.

The decision, entered in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, follows an investigation by the department's Employee Benefits Security Administration that found that the citrus farming cooperative, based in Sherman Oaks, Calif., and the plans' fiduciaries mishandled employee retirement funds in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. ""Retirement plan assets represent workers' hard-earned savings, not a source of operating funds that companies can choose to use as they see fit,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Employee Benefits Security Phyllis C. Borzi. ""This is a case of plan fiduciaries failing in their legal and ethical duties to act solely in the interest of plan participants."" The department previously filed a lawsuit alleging that from January 2006 through April 2011, the defendants used retirement plan assets to improperly reimburse the company for expenses including salaries and benefits for employees and managers working in various departments at Sunkist Growers. EBSA investigators also found that the company was reimbursed by the plans based on projected expenses determined at the beginning of the year rather than on the actual expenses incurred, and that no adjustments were made to repay the plans for the overpayments that were made. The judgment permanently enjoins the fiduciaries from violating ERISA and requires the appointment of an independent fiduciary to review and approve any future services provided by Sunkist Growers to the plans.

The department's complaint alleges that a Clearwater Paper employee was fired in 2010 in retaliation for filing a safety complaint with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Boise Area Office. The employee was first suspended and then fired soon after OSHA conducted an inspection to assess excessive exposure to red cedar dust at Clearwater Paper's sawmill in Lewiston. This facility was later sold in 2011. ""Raising a workplace safety and health concern is a courageous act of good citizenship,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health Dr. David Michaels. ""Not a single worker should fear harassment, intimidation or a disciplinary action for contributing to a safe and healthy workplace. Employees have the right to contact OSHA without fear of retaliation."" The department is seeking reinstatement of the employee as well as payment of more than $300,000 in damages and fees, including back pay, compensatory damages, emotional distress damages and punitive damages. Clearwater Paper manufactures consumer paper products. OSHA enforces the whistleblower provision of the OSH Act and 21 other statutes protecting employees who report violations of various securities, trucking, airline, nuclear, pipeline, environmental, public transportation, workplace safety and health, consumer product safety, health care reform and financial reform laws. Under these laws enacted by Congress, employers are prohibited from retaliating against employees who raise various protected concerns or provide protected information to the employer or to the government. Employees who believe that they have been retaliated against for engaging in protected conduct may file a complaint with the secretary of labor for an investigation by OSHA's Office of Whistleblower Protection Program. Detailed information on employee whistleblower rights, including fact sheets with information on how to file a complaint with OSHA, is available online at http://www.whistleblowers.gov .

In response to requests for an extension, the deadline to submit written comments and testimony is being extended from Dec. 11, 2013, to Jan. 27, 2014, to allow stakeholders additional time to comment on the proposed rule and supporting analyses. OSHA is also extending the deadline to submit notices of intention to appear at its informal public hearings by an additional 30 days, from Nov. 12, 2013, to Dec. 12, 2013. Public hearings are scheduled to begin on March 18, 2014. The duration of the hearings will be determined by the number of parties who request to appear. The hearings are expected to continue for several weeks. The notice of proposed rulemaking was published in the Federal Register on Sept. 12, 2013. The proposed rule was made available to the public on OSHA's website Aug. 23, 2013. ""We strongly encourage the public to assist in the process of developing a final rule by submitting written comments and participating in public hearings,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health Dr. David Michaels. ""We especially hope to hear from employers, workers and public health professionals who have experience in successfully protecting workers from silica-related diseases.

"October 24, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20131024,OSHA News Release: OSHA releases new resources to better protect workers from hazardous chemicals [10/24/2013],"WASHINGTON — Each year in the United States, tens of thousands of workers are made sick or die from occupational exposures to the thousands of hazardous chemicals that are used in workplaces every day. The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration today launched two new web resources to assist companies with keeping their workers safe. While many chemicals are suspected of being harmful, OSHA's exposure standards are out-of-date and inadequately protective for the small number of chemicals that are regulated in the workplace. The first resource OSHA has created is a toolkit to identify safer chemicals that can be used in place of more hazardous ones. This toolkit walks employers and workers step-by-step through information, methods, tools and guidance to either eliminate hazardous chemicals or make informed substitution decisions in the workplace by finding a safer chemical, material, product or process. The toolkit is available at http://www.osha.gov/dsg/safer_chemicals/index.html . ""We know that the most efficient and effective way to protect workers from hazardous chemicals is by eliminating or replacing those chemicals with safer alternatives whenever possible,"" said Dr. David Michaels, assistant secretary of labor for occupational safety and health. OSHA also created another new web resource: the Annotated Permissible Exposure Limits, or annotated PEL tables, which will enable employers to voluntarily adopt newer, more protective workplace exposure limits. OSHA's PELs set mandatory limits on the amount or concentration of a substance in the air to protect workers against the health effects of certain hazardous chemicals; and OSHA will continue to enforce those mandatory PELs. Since OSHA's adoption of the majority of its PELs more than 40 years ago, new scientific data, industrial experience and developments in technology clearly indicate that in many instances these mandatory limits are not sufficiently protective of workers' health. ""There is no question that many of OSHA's chemical standards are not adequately protective,"" Michaels said. ""I advise employers, who want to ensure that their workplaces are safe, to utilize the occupational exposure limits on these annotated tables, since simply complying with OSHA's antiquated PELs will not guarantee that workers will be safe."" The annotated PEL tables provide a side-by-side comparison of OSHA PELs for general industry to the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health PELs, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recommended exposure limits, and American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist threshold limit values. They offer an easily accessible reference source for up-to-date workplace exposure limits, which are available at http://www.osha.gov/dsg/annotated-pels/index.html .

"October 24, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20132062,MSHA News Release: MSHA issues first POV notices under new rule [10/24/2013],"1 mine in Kentucky and 2 mines in West Virginia receive notices ARLINGTON, Va. — The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration announced today that three mining operations have been put on notice of a pattern of violations of mandatory health or safety standards under Section 104(e) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. The POV screening is the first one conducted since MSHA's revised Pattern of Violations rule went into effect on March 25, 2013. These revisions improve MSHA's ability to act when it finds a pattern of violations. The three mines that received POV notices are: Tram Energy LLC's Mine No. 1 in Floyd County, Ky.; Brody Mining LLC's Brody Mine No. 1 in Boone County, W.Va.; and Pocahontas Coal Company LLC's Affinity Mine in Raleigh County, W.Va. MSHA's review for POV covered all 14,600 of the nation's mines. The agency is still reviewing the injury records of several mines to determine if they should be considered for a POV notice based on this screening. Under the Mine Act, MSHA is authorized to issue a POV notice to mine operators that demonstrate a disregard for the health and safety of miners through a pattern of significant and substantial violations. A POV notice, one of the agency's toughest enforcement actions, is reserved for the mines that pose the greatest risk to the safety of miners. An S&S violation is one that is reasonably likely to result in a reasonably serious injury or illness. The Mine Act requires mines that receive POV notices to be issued withdrawal orders — effectively ceasing operations — for all S&S violations. After no mine was placed on POV for the first 33 years after the Mine Act went into effect, these POV notices mark the third year in a row that MSHA has used this critical tool to protect miners from serious hazards. ""MSHA's new POV rule, which we will vigorously enforce, enhances protections for miners and shifts the responsibility for monitoring compliance and taking action to prevent POV enforcement actions to the operator,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. Tram Energy's Mine No. 1 received 120 S&S violations during the POV review period — more than half of those violations involved elevated levels of operator negligence. MSHA issued 40 closure orders at Tram Energy during the POV review period, the most of any mine in the country. The company has incurred approximately $170,000 in civil penalties since it began operating in 2012. All but $666 is unpaid and delinquent. Brody Mining's Brody Mine No. 1 received 253 S&S violations during the review period. An MSHA audit of Brody Mining's records found that injuries of miners resulted in 1,757 lost work days at the mine, 367 of which were from eight lost-time injuries that Brody Mining failed to report to MSHA. The company was also audited during the 2012 POV screening process. In that audit, MSHA found 29 injuries Brody Mining failed to report and 724 unreported lost work days. Pocahontas Coal Company's Affinity Mine received 124 S&S violations during the review period, a quarter of which MSHA cited as involving high negligence or reckless disregard for the health and safety of miners. Two miners died in separate accidents during the review period; the fatalities occurred within two weeks of each other and both involved scoops. Affinity Mine received 35 closure orders during the review period, the third highest in the country. The new rule eliminated the requirement that MSHA consider only fully adjudicated orders in its POV review, shifted responsibility for monitoring compliance to the mine operator and mandated that operators submit corrective action programs to proactively address issues that could lead to a POV. In 2010, MSHA identified 53 mines for review, issuing 17 potential POV notices and two POV notices. The October 2011 screening resulted in the review of 39 mines and the issuance of eight potential POV notices. In 2012, MSHA identified 20 mines and issued four potential POV notices. This year, MSHA identified nine mines for additional review. The improvements made in 2010 to the screening criteria were designed to help MSHA better identify the mines that present the greatest risks to miners, and the criteria has remained largely unchanged since they were implemented. ""The decrease in the number of operators meeting the POV criteria shows that the POV process is working — many operators are cleaning up their acts, even when MSHA is not looking over their shoulders,"" said Main."

The settlement resolves a suit filed in April 2012 after an investigation by the department's Employee Benefits Security Administration found violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The department alleged that plan fiduciaries caused or permitted the ESOP to purchase Parrot Cellular stock for more than fair market value. The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, named as defendants Dennis Webb, the principal owner of California-based Entrepreneurial Ventures Inc.; Matthew Fidiam and J. Robert Gallucci, EVI executives and ESOP trustees; and Consulting Fiduciaries Inc., an Illinois company that served as the independent fiduciary for the ESOP during a November 2002 stock purchase. EVI operates Parrot Cellular telephone retail stores and is the sponsor of the worker retirement plan. ""Employee stock ownership plans can have great benefits for workers, but only if they adhere to the laws that govern them,"" said Secretary of Labor Thomas E. Perez. ""We are very pleased to have resolved this matter in a way that brings the plan into compliance with the law and benefits the plan's participants."" ""Officials responsible for employee stock ownership plans are legally required to act prudently and solely in the interests of plan participants when purchasing or selling employer stock,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Employee Benefits Security Phyllis C. Borzi. ""This is true for all fiduciaries of all employee benefit plans covered by ERISA."" Under the terms of the settlement agreement, Consulting Fiduciaries agreed to pay $2 million to the ESOP to settle the allegations. Webb, Fidiam and Gallucci agreed to collectively pay $1.5 million to the ESOP, and Webb agreed to pay an additional $681,818 to the ESOP.

An investigation by the department's Employee Benefits Security Administration established that Housman, acting as the sole fiduciary to the employee pension plan, violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act by mismanaging plan assets, resulting in the loss of $617,839. The judgment requires Housman to restore all losses caused to the plan, less his share. As the plan's fiduciary, Housman had a responsibility to act solely in the interest of the company's money purchase pension plan and its participants. Investigators found that he breached that responsibility when he made prohibited transactions to benefit the company. Over three years, Housman authorized 41 separate loans totaling $496,000 from the plan to the company. The loans, which were not repaid, were used to cover operational expenses, including payroll. The plan also lost $122,000 in estimated interest. Housman had guaranteed that money would be included in the loan repayment. ""Workers should not have to worry about whether their pension funds are secure in the hands of their pension plan's fiduciaries,"" said Ty Fukumoto, deputy director of the EBSA Los Angeles Regional Office, which investigated the case. ""The department holds those entrusted with looking after workers' retirement savings to the highest legal standards."" The consent judgment orders Housman to restore $363,913 in losses to the plan's remaining participants. To ensure repayment, Housman must attempt to secure a life insurance policy that provides no less than $150,000, and names the plan as the sole beneficiary. Housman must report his financial status to the department annually until plan losses are fully restored. He will no longer serve as the plan fiduciary, and is permanently enjoined and restrained from future service as a fiduciary of, or service provider to, any ERISA-covered employee benefit plan. Jeanne Bryant of Receivership Management Inc. has been assigned as independent fiduciary and will administer the plan. The department's Office of the Solicitor litigated the case. Twelve Signs was a private corporation that published Starscroll magazine. The company ceased operating in 2009 and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January 2010.

Perez issued the following statement about the September 2013 Employment Situation report released today: ""The economy added 148,000 total nonfarm jobs in September. With the addition of 126,000 private-sector jobs, that makes a total of over 7.6 million new private-sector jobs over the last 43 consecutive months of growth. The monthly unemployment rate inched downward to 7.2 percent and has been below 8 percent for a full year, following more than three and a half years above 8 percent. Average hourly earnings rose by 3 cents in September, with a 49-cent increase over the last year. ""The economy continues on the road to recovery, but at a more modest pace than the American people need or expect. President Obama continues to push for an agenda that will kick the recovery into a higher gear. He is asking Congress to pass a budget that invests in important priorities like education, infrastructure and technology, while continuing to reduce the deficit over the long term. And he is stepping up the call to fix our broken immigration system in a way that increases economic growth. These job-creating initiatives should have been the nation's focus over the last month; instead we were sidetracked by a divisive struggle that inflicted unnecessary wounds on the economy. ""This report comes behind schedule, as the federal government was shut down on the first Friday of this month. It does not reflect the adverse impact of the shutdown on the national economy, something we won't be able to fully measure until more data are released in the coming months. ""But we do know that economic uncertainty was already holding back growth even before this latest standoff. The shutdown and the threat to default on our nation's debt unquestionably set back our recovery. Employers put hiring and investment on hold. Families delayed or cut back on spending. Banks raised the cost of borrowing for homeowners and small businesses. The financial markets reacted negatively, and we lost respect in the eyes of the world. This avoidable confrontation was exactly what an economy on the mend did not need. ""The economy can't live up to its potential if it's hijacked every few months. Businesses manufacture jobs, while Congress manufactures crises. Let's move on to the task that Americans demand of us — working together to create jobs, grow the economy and strengthen the middle class."""

Under President Obama's leadership, federal agencies are collaborating more effectively to make smart investments that provide stakeholders with a seamless process for applying for federal resources. To that end, the Make it in America Challenge allowed applicants to submit one application to fund projects that: help distressed regions build on existing assets, promote a competitive environment for foreign-owned and domestic firms to establish and grow their U.S. operations, create jobs and develop a skilled workforce for specific industries. A forthcoming announcement will be made regarding additional funding from the National Institute of Standards and Technology Manufacturing Extension Partnership, which will focus on developing greater connectivity of regional supply chains in addition to assisting small- and medium-sized enterprises. The Make it in America Challenge builds on the United States' significant competitive advantages — from a strong business climate, to a highly-skilled and productive workforce — that make it a profitable place for businesses to invest. Investing in businesses and production here can help put more Americans back to work. Some of the ways in which the administration has already helped American workers and businesses thrive include: enhancing the general business climate, securing access to markets for U.S. exports, providing financial and technical support for companies to grow and expand, providing funding to improve education and training opportunities to develop a skilled workforce, and enforcing global trade rules to ensure that American businesses and workers are competing on a level playing field.

Since then, the company and Gaines failed to administer the plan and have effectively abandoned it. As a result, participants are unable to receive information or gain access to their funds. As of March 31, 2010, the plan had approximately 147 participants and assets of approximately $102,117.90. Resolution: The department is seeking to remove the defendants as fiduciaries to the plan, enjoin the defendants from engaging in further violations of Title I of Employee Retirement Income Security Administration, appoint an independent fiduciary to arrange for termination of the plan and distribution of its assets, and to provide such other relief as may be just and equitable.

"October 15, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20131015-0,ETA News Release: Nearly $170M in Ready to Work Partnership grants awarded to help long-term unemployed Americans find work [10/15/2013],"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Labor today announced $169,771,960 in grants to expedite the employment of Americans struggling with long-term unemployment. The grants are part of the Ready to Work Partnership (link is external) initiative to support and scale innovative collaborations between employers, nonprofit organizations and federal job training programs to help connect ready-to-work Americans with ready-to-be-filled jobs. ""There's no question that individuals struggling with long-term unemployment are better off than they were 12 months ago, but there are still twice as many of them as there were before the recession. The constant struggle to find work has left many of them feeling discouraged and disregarded,"" said U.S. Secretary of Labor Thomas E. Perez. ""The federal grants we're awarding today are part of a series of administration initiatives designed to help encourage, empower and employ this pool of talented individuals."" These grants are part of an administration-wide effort (link is external) to address the ongoing issue of long-term unemployment. Secretary Perez and Jeff Zients, director of the National Economic Council, will meet with chief human resource officers of leading companies, including Citigroup Inc., CVS Health, The Boeing Co. and Dow Chemical Co., among others, during a roundtable discussion hosted at the White House on Wednesday, Oct. 15, to discuss improvements these companies have made to increase recruitment of and eliminate barriers to hiring long-term unemployed individuals. The Office of Personnel Management will also issue guidance today to federal agencies on increasing recruitment and hiring of long-term unemployed individuals. Grants, ranging from $3 million to $10 million, were awarded to 23 partnerships to serve individuals in 20 states and Puerto Rico. Three grantees — District 1199C Training & Upgrading Fund (Pennsylvania), Memphis Bioworks Foundation (Tennessee) and Worksystems Inc. (Oregon) — will support projects in multiple states. All grants funded today will incorporate three primary functions: Outreach and Recruitment Grantees will work with state unemployment insurance programs, the network of more than 2,500 American Job Centers (link is external) around the country, community and faith-based organizations, job clubs and other worker advocate organizations to identity and recruit participants in need of training and supportive services. Training and Support Services Participants in programs funded by these grants will receive job training and support services for occupations in information technology, advanced manufacturing, health care and other high-demand industries. Participants will receive a comprehensive, up-front assessment of their needs and skills resulting in customized classroom and online training that will lead them to an industry-recognized degree or certificate. Participants will also receive financial counseling, child-care support, health care and other services to help them focus on finding a job. All of the grantees have also demonstrated strong partnerships with local employers and industry groups that offer work-based training opportunities, such as paid internships, on-the-job training or Registered Apprenticeships (link is external) . Work-based training will allow long-term unemployed individuals to fill in gaps of employment in their resumes, gain first-hand experience with an employer and establish a direct link to permanent employment. Placement StrategiesAll projects incorporate strong placement strategies to support long-term unemployed workers in finding rapid employment in middle- and high- skilled jobs. These projects will include a designated career coach to guide long-term unemployed individuals from the assessment period all the way to job placement. Services will include resume consultation, networking coaching, social media strategies and mock interview with employers. In addition, many projects include commitments from employers to hire or interview program participants following their completion of a work-based training program. The goals of the Ready to Work Partnership initiative are closely aligned with the Obama administration's job-driven training principles (link is external) . Grantees will work with local and regional employers, industry groups and their state commerce and development agencies to strengthen public-private partnerships. In addition, all grants require an evaluation component that will help significantly increase the body of knowledge about the most effective strategies in workforce development. The original grants solicitation announced funding of up to $150 million for this program. However, additional H-1B funding was made available, which allowed for approximately $20 million more to be awarded. Editor's Note : A full list of grantees and grant amounts follows this release.

Two fatalities occurred in underground mines in West Virginia and Illinois, and one fatality occurred at a surface mine in Wyoming. At the McElroy mine in West Virginia, a longwall maintenance foreman was killed on Oct. 4 while assisting in setting up the panline on a new longwall face. The victim was standing in the face conveyor, facing the tailgate side of the section, when the accident occurred. A pulley was attached to a section of the pan line/face conveyor structure and a scoop was being used to pull the face conveyor chain. The sheave failed, came loose and struck the victim in the back of the head. A fatality occurred Oct. 5 at the Pattiki mine in Illinois involving a golf cart used for underground transportation. The victim was in the golf cart when the accident occurred. The golf cart rolled over and pinned the victim underneath it. At the Bridger Coal mine in Wyoming, a dozer operator was killed Oct. 6 when the dozer went over a 150-foot highwall in the early hours of Sunday morning. When the victim did not report in at the end of his regular shift, the operator began to search and found the dozer and victim at the bottom of the highwall. ""Three miners killed on three consecutive days is extremely troubling,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""The fact that that this occurred over the weekend, when there may be a greater expectation an MSHA inspector would not be present, is a red flag."" The coal mining industry has not had three consecutive days of fatal accidents in more than 10 years, Main said. The last time was Dec. 26-28, 2002, and also included a weekend. Under the Mine Act, operators have the primary responsibility of protecting miners from safety and health hazards. MSHA will be issuing alerts on these three fatalities once more information is known, and will be communicating with coal mine operators and miners about the importance of and continuing responsibility to conduct examinations and other safety checks to find and fix hazards to protect miners. During a lapse in appropriations MSHA continues to perform certain activities which, if not conducted, would significantly compromise the safety of human life in the nation's mines, such as targeted inspections at high-hazard mines and azard-specific inspections across the nation based upon conditions and practices that have recently caused death and serious injury. MSHA reminds miners and mine operators that they may use the agency's toll-free ""One Call Does it All"" number to report accidents or hazardous conditions. That number is 1-800-746-1553. Callers can report hazardous conditions to MSHA anonymously if they choose."

OSHA's investigation found that the company violated the whistleblower provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act when it wrongfully terminated the former CFO for warning the board of directors about ethical and financial concerns raised by a proposed merger. ""OSHA plays a key role in protecting the integrity of the financial markets and the economy,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health Dr. David Michaels. ""We protect those who are courageous enough to speak out, even internally, about violations of securities rules and regulations."" In late March 2010, the former CFO provided information to the company's board of directors based on a reasonable belief there was a conflict of interest involving the chair of CDTI's board of directors. The former CFO believed that a proposed merger was: detrimental to the company, critical financial information had been withheld from board members, and the conflict of interest violated internal company controls mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission as well as the company's own corporate code of ethics. After being terminated from employment in April 2010, the former CFO filed a whistleblower complaint with OSHA one week later. OSHA's investigation found merit to the complaint. ""This order should send a clear message to publicly traded companies that silencing those who try to do the right thing is unacceptable,"" Dr. Michaels added. As a result, OSHA has ordered CDTI a manufacturer and distributor of emission control systems based in Ventura, Calif., formerly headquartered in Stamford, Conn., to pay the complainant more than $486,000 in lost wages, bonuses, stock options and severance pay. In addition, the company must also pay the complainant over $1.4 million in compensatory damages for pain and suffering, damage to career and professional reputation and lost 401(k) employer matches and expenses. The order also directs the company to post OSHA's findings in an 8-K submission to the SEC since previous filings about the complainant's termination and whistleblower activity had also been posted to the SEC. The company must also expunge all files and computerized data systems of disciplinary actions related to the complainant's termination, pay reasonable attorney's fees and post the order and a notice to workers at all company locations and on its internal website. In addition, OSHA will inform the SEC of its findings so that it can pursue any other appropriate action. CDTI and the complainant each have 30 days from receipt of the findings to file an appeal with the department's Office of Administrative Law Judges. OSHA enforces the whistleblower provisions of Sarbanes-Oxley and 21 other statutes protecting employees who report violations of various securities laws, trucking, airline, nuclear power, pipeline, environmental, rail, public transportation, workplace safety and health, and con4sumer protection laws. Employers are prohibited from retaliating against employees who raise various protected concerns or provide protected information to the employer or the government. Employees who believe that they have been retaliated against for engaging in protected conduct may file a complaint with the secretary of labor for an investigation by OSHA's Whistleblower Protection Program. More information is available online at http://www.whistleblowers.gov/ . Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. OSHA's role is to ensure these conditions for America's working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education and assistance.

The funding will be used to develop and implement training and related materials for mine emergency preparedness, as well as for the prevention of accidents in underground mines. The recipients and the amount of funding they are receiving: The United Mine Workers of America Career Centers Inc., based in Washington, Pa., is receiving $179,289 in second-year funding to provide training in the conduct of Mine Rescue Skills Contests. Participating in well-designed mine rescue contests is vital for mine rescue personnel to maintain and improve mine emergency preparedness protocols. After completing classroom curriculum and training exercises, trainees will apply their knowledge in a variety of hands-on training scenarios in simulated coal mines. The Center for Strategic Management Public Leadership Institute Inc. in Severna Park, Md., is receiving $122,769 in new grant funding to improve the quality of mine emergency skills training in the mining industry. This will be accomplished by employing an innovative train-the-trainer approach that focuses on using technology to improve communication during mine emergencies. The Colorado School of Mines in Golden, Colo., is receiving $117,747 in second-year funding to provide quality training to mine rescue teams. The training will focus on improving the technical, communications and decision-making skills of a team and individuals staffing the incident command center during mine emergencies. The Colorado Division of Reclamation Mining and Safety, whose main office is in Denver is receiving $112,999 in new grant funding to provide training in mine emergency prevention and preparedness with a program that uses real-life scenarios designed to help miners recognize and mitigate hazards and develop emergency response skills. This will be accomplished by developing a preshift/on-shift mine examiner training and auditing program. Additionally, small mine rescue teams in Colorado, which must respond to mine emergencies at hundreds of active and abandoned mines, will receive training and support from Colorado's DRMS with this funding. The Virginia Department of Mines, Minerals and Energy, which is headquartered in Richmond, Va., is receiving $50,000 in new grant funding to develop a training video on emergency preparedness deficiencies revealed by past mine disasters, with a focus on improving escape and decision-making skills during emergencies. Training grants are awarded for a 12-month performance period, and applicants must be states or nonprofit entities. The grants program was established through a provision in the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006. The grants were named in remembrance of 13 men who died in two explosions at the Jim Walter Resources Inc. No. 5 Mine in Brookwood, Ala., in 2001 and 12 men who died in an explosion at the Sago Mine in Tallmansville, W.Va., in 2006."

Perez today announced the release of a new report and updated list on child labor and forced labor and the award of $26 million in grants to combat child labor in four countries. The event at the department's headquarters included remarks by Secretary Perez, Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa and former Secretary of Labor Alexis Herman, as well as a video message from Dr. Maya Soetoro-Ng of the University of Hawaii at Manoa. ""These reports remind us that children and adults continue to be exploited for their labor in countries around the world. Until this is no longer true, our work is not done,"" said Secretary Perez. ""We need to call upon governments, international and regional organizations, social partners and civil society to work together to end these human rights abuses."" New global estimates from the International Labour Organization place the number of child laborers at 168 million worldwide. The department's twelfth annual edition of its ""Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor,"" a report mandated by the Trade and Development Act of 2000, which analyzes the worst forms of child labor in 143 foreign countries and territories. The report assesses efforts in countries to eliminate the worst forms of child labor, tracking from year to year whether a country has made significant, moderate, minimal or no advancement. This year, 10 countries, more than ever before, received an assessment of significant advancement. The report is available at http://www.dol.gov/ilab/reports/child-labor/findings/ . ""I have long had a vision of a world free of the scourge of exploitative child labor,"" said Senator Harkin. ""This report is one of our most effective tools in this fight. It is a voice for the voiceless and a call to action on their behalf. We must sustain this fight for as long as it takes."" The department also released an update of its ""List of Goods Produced by Child or Forced Labor,"" as required by the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2005, and announced its decision to remove three goods (charcoal from Namibia, diamonds from Zimbabwe and tobacco from Kazakhstan) from that list. The updated list includes a total of 134 goods from 73 countries that the department's Bureau of International Labor Affairs has reason to believe are produced by forced labor, child labor or both in violation of international standards.

The grants are part of the department's Reemployment Connections initiative, an effort to better integrate the Unemployment Insurance program with the broader workforce system in order to improve the re-employment outcomes for Unemployment Insurance claimants and other job seekers. ""The grants announced today are part of the broader goal of turning the unemployment insurance system into a re-employment system,"" said Eric M. Seleznow, acting assistant secretary of labor for employment and training. ""The Reemployment Connections program will enhance states' ability to provide a full range of resources to the unemployed to help them quickly get back into the workforce."" Reemployment Connections, originally called the Unemployment Insurance Workforce Connectivity Project when the program began in 2011, is an effort to move toward a single, integrated workforce system. The program assists states in developing re-employment strategies that include: The creation of a common registration protocol (also known as a ""common front door"") for all UI claimants and job seekers so that all of the resources of the workforce system are available to everyone, including income support and the full array of re-employment services in a cohesive and integrated way; Real-time data sharing that integrates new information and interactions with the customer to improve reemployment service delivery; Increased use of social media for outreach and service delivery to support two way communication with customers, which enables networking among job seekers with common characteristics and connects job seekers to employers. Each state recipient will receive $80,000 to develop an action plan that implements one or more of these re-employment strategies. Grantees are required to participate in the Reemployment Connections Virtual Institute, a web-based collaboration tool that offers participating states information, assistance and a platform for possible partnerships with other states to improve the implementation of innovative re-employment strategies. The funds can be used for: in-state travel; technology, software and supplies needed to participate in the Institute; costs of convening team members and a meeting facilitator. These grants are awarded in partnership with the National Association of State Workforce Agencies, and they are funded through the Workforce Investment Act.

While America's businesses have created 10 million jobs over the past 54 months, the longest streak of uninterrupted job growth in our country's history, we need to do more to train Americans with the skills they need, and connect them with businesses that are looking for skilled workers. While America's businesses have created 10 million jobs over the past 54 months, the longest streak of uninterrupted job growth in our country's history, we need to do more to train Americans with the skills they need, and connect them with businesses that are looking for skilled workers. Today, as part of this effort, Vice President Biden, Secretary Thomas E. Perez, and Secretary Arne Duncan are announcing the winners of $450 million in job-driven training grants going to nearly 270 community colleges across the country. The funding is part of the Trade Adjustment Assistance Community College and Career Training (TAACCCT) competitive grant program, which is co-administered by the Department of Labor and Department of Education. The grants will provide community colleges and other eligible institutions of higher education with funds to partner with employers to expand and improve their ability to deliver education and career training programs that will help job seekers get the skills they need for in-demand jobs in industries like information technology, health care, energy, and advanced manufacturing. Building on the strategies advanced in the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, these types of job-driven training partnerships were also identified in the Vice President's job-driven training report (link is external) released in July as an important way to successfully prepare and place workers in jobs that pay a middle class wage. Additional Information About Today's Winners: Awarding $450 Million to Nearly 270 Community Colleges Partnering with More than 400 Employers Nationally: Today's 71 grantees build on nearly $1.5 billion in TAACCCT grant funds that have gone over the past three years to strengthen and expand job-driven training partnerships in communities across the country. Partnerships with Hundreds of Employers to Train Low-Wage Workers for Middle-Class Jobs: All grantees are required to partner with employers to develop training programs to enable workers to build skills that will help them obtain good jobs. Partnerships with employers such as Exxon-Mobil, IBM, Delta, Jetblue, CVS, and Habitat for Humanity, and with labor and community based organizations such as SEIU, Goodwill Industries, Urban League and the United Way, will assist in getting thousands of low-wage Americans access to more internships, apprenticeships, and job-relevant basic skills education and training in order to move up the career ladder into better-paying jobs that employers across the country are looking to fill. Winners Are in High Demand Fields – Including 25 Focusing on IT and Cybersecurity: 25 grantees are developing new training programs for information technology and cybersecurity jobs, which are growing two times the national average.

The Cape Cod Community College (CCCC) will launch new accelerated pathways for jobs in the aviation industry through unique partnerships with 15 statewide and regional employers including the US Coast Guard, Camp Edwards Army National Guard, two industry associations, and the MA Department of Workforce Development. These partnerships will make CCCC one of only six community colleges in the nation and the only community college in the eastern New England region to offer accelerated Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) airframe and power plant (A&P) certification. The Massachusetts Credentials and Careers in Aviation (MCCA) program has worked with JetBlue, Delta, Cape Air, and Island Air, among others, to develop the airframe and power plant certificate modules. This approach will prepare unemployed and underemployed individuals in only 12 months instead of the traditional 24. Through hands-on learning and a guaranteed internship with an employer partner, students will be trained to become Aviation Maintenance Technicians, Avionics Technicians, Aerospace Engineering and Operations Technicians. Due to strong partnerships with employers, an industry-driven curriculum, and an urgent need for employees with the required skills, job placement is projected at 85% of those completing at least one certificate. The CCCC is working closely with the state of Massachusetts to secure employer donations of engines and aircrafts. Student scholarships will also be provided by Cape Cod Pilot Association, the State Space Grant Consortium based at MIT through NASA grants. In addition, the Department of Education is releasing a new report on the importance of building foundational skills in a job-specific context. Department of Education Report on Transform Adult Learning through Work. The Department of Education is releasing a new report with recommendations to transform adult learning in the United States. After months of public engagement with a variety of stakeholders around the country, the recommendations for public-private partnership include strategies that engage employers to support upskilling of more entry-level workers while on the job, encourage the use of assessments and innovative learning tools to improve access to targeted career guidance for youth and adults, and promote better alignment and coordination of public and private programs so that youth and adults experience seamless services. The report highlights unique opportunities for implementing these recommendations as a result of the changed legislative environment made possible by the passage of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act in July 2014. Training for High-Growth Information Technology and Cybersecurity Jobs. 25 grantees are developing new training programs for information technology and cybersecurity jobs. These jobs span all sectors of the economy, and non-IT industries currently employ two-thirds of private sector IT workers. New Ivy Tech Computing and Informatics School in Indiana ($2.5M).

Texas Manufacturing and Electronics Technology Program for Veterans ($3.2M). The Veterans-Focused Engineering Technology Project (VFETP) will leverage Richland College's existing programs in manufacturing and electronics technology, robust commitments from employers, and TAACCCT dollars to meet the needs of approximately veterans who need to re-skill to be competitive in the job market. The VFETO will offer certificates in supervisory control and data acquisition and electromechanical maintenance and will work with the National Institute for Metalworking Skills (NIMS) and the International Society of Certified Electronic Technicians (ISCET) to offer credentials that have been requested by Richland College's employer partners. The VFETP will also offer veterans and spouses the option to complete most core courses and some field specific courses online, including safety and technical algebra, in their last six months of service, and finish their AAS degrees within one year after discharge. Over 15 employers including Texas Instruments, Oncor, and Raytheon have already indicated that they will hire program completers and have also committed to supporting curricula development, offering internships, providing on-the-job training, and developing applied problems for students. In addition, the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) released a report to the President outlining recommendations to expand opportunity for middle-skill workers through STEM education, job training and matching enabled by IT. PCAST Recommendations to Use Technology for Targeting Job-Skills Training and Matching Talent to Jobs. Today, the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) released a report (link is external) to the President outlining three recommendations to expand opportunity for middle-skill workers—people whose jobs require some postsecondary training but not a conventional college degree. PCAST identifies opportunities to provide faster, more effective tech-enabled training, to match workers to jobs and training based on their abilities, and to foster stronger connections between employers and training providers so that that curricula keep up with employers' needs. PCAST recommends the federal government facilitate private sector leadership by: (1) bringing industry together with government to encourage activities such as standards-setting and approaches to facilitate information exchange across employers, workers, and training providers, (2) continuing to support the research and development of IT to facilitate assessment of skills and training needs, counseling about training and career options, and delivery of training that culminates in credentials that can be validated, and (3) for the Federal Government to lead by example as a major employer itself. Pathways to Careers for Youth and Young Adults with Disabilities The Department of Labor is also releasing $2 million in grants through the Pathways to Careers: Community College for Youth and Young Adults with Disabilities Project. These grants will be awarded to two prior TAACCCT grantees to develop, test, and evaluate new integrated education and career training strategies to help ensure that youth and young adults with disabilities acquire the skills, degrees, and credentials needed for high wage, high skill employment. The Pellissippi State Community College (PSCC) Universal Pathways to Employment Project (UPEP) will expand its capacity and, ultimately that of other institutions to deliver integrated education and career training to students with disabilities by implementing model and research-based practices. The PSCC UPEP project will build upon the Guideposts for Success best practices and improve access to training for students with disabilities by braiding funding from three previous TAACCCT grants currently in place at PSCC: 1) RxTN, an online nursing and health care career focused program funded in Round II of TAACCCT; 2) Multi-State Advanced Manufacturing Consortium (M-SAMC), a program focused on the competencies needed for manufacturing line jobs funded in Round III of TAACCCT and 3) Southeastern Economic and Education Leadership Consortium (SEELC), a program which utilizes virtual training equipment funded in Round IV of TAACCCT. The Onondaga Pathways to Careers (OPC) project will increase access and enrollment amount youth and young adults with disabilities in Career and Technical programs aligned with high-growth industries and occupations. The project will leverage the State University of New York T.E.A.M. Educational Pathways grant funded in Round II of TAACCCT, which offers employer-validated curriculum, fast-track developmental education, prior learning assessments, and work-based learning partnerships, to expand opportunities for students with disabilities. They will also strengthen the continuum of education and training with multiple ""on- and off-ramps"" by leveraging the networks, resources, and programs developed through the TAACCCT Advanced Manufacturing project, including the new Advanced Manufacturing Certificate, which was completed with active participation of employers and approved by New York State Education Department for launch in fall 2014. Building on Progress and Moving Ahead Many of today's grantees are building on the efforts of past TAACCCT winners, leveraging curriculum that has been developed through strong partnerships between community colleges, the workforce system, employers and industry groups to transform the way they design and deliver courses through accelerated learning strategies. Consistent with the recommendation of the Vice President's job-driven training report, community college grantees in this final round will work with business and industry to upskill thousands of low-wage, low-skill workers and expand competency-based accelerated training pathways to in-demand jobs in information technology, manufacturing, health care, and other fields. The Administration will continue to take action and work with educators, businesses, labor, and other leaders across the country to train American workers, expand the middle class, and grow the economy. The Vice President's job-driven training report identified a job-driven ""checklist"" as a tool to maximize the effectiveness of over 25 competitive grant programs, to direct state and local training and employment programs to become more job-driven, to make sure all federal employment and training programs are engaging employers, and to improve information on employment results so we know what's working well and what's not. We must continue to invest in these types of partnerships, which successfully train American workers. That's why the President's 2015 budget proposes a $6 billion Community College Job-Driven Training Fund to ensure that we are sufficiently investing in partnerships between our nation's community colleges and employers to ensure all American have access to workplace relevant skills and training. The President's 2015 budget proposes investing $6 billion over four years in a Community College Job-Driven Training Fund. This fund would support competitive grants to partnerships of community colleges, industry and employers to reform job training curricula and launch new programs to train workers for in-demand jobs and careers. This fund will also help to spur the development and adoption of common, industry-recognized credentials and skill assessments to allow employers to more easily identify and hire qualified candidates. $2 billion of these funds will be set aside to double the number of U.S. Registered Apprenticeships within five years. 2014 TAACCCT Grants by State Choose a 2014 TAACCCT Grants by State Choose A State ALABAMA ALASKA ARIZONA ARKANSAS CALIFORNIA COLORADO CONNECTICUT DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA DELAWARE FLORIDA GEORGIA HAWAII IDAHO ILLINOIS INDIANA IOWA KANSAS KENTUCKY LOUISIANA MAINE MARYLAND MASSACHUSETTS MICHIGAN MINNESOTA MISSISSIPPI MISSOURI MONTANA NEBRASKA NEW HAMPSHIRE NEW JERSEY NEW MEXICO NEW YORK NEVADA NORTH CAROLINA NORTH DAKOTA OHIO OKLAHOMA OREGON PENNSYLVANIA PUERTO RICO RHODE ISLAND SOUTH CAROLINA SOUTH DAKOTA TENNESSEE TEXAS UTAH VERMONT VIRGINIA WASHINGTON WEST VIRGINIA WISCONSIN WYOMING Note: Project descriptions are taken from language provided by grantees as part of their abstracts.

"September 27, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ilab/ilab20130927,"ILAB News Release: US Labor Department issues report on labor concerns in Dominican sugar sector, announces $10 million project in agriculture [09/27/2013]","WASHINGTON — U.S. Secretary of Labor Thomas E. Perez today released a report regarding labor concerns in the Dominican sugar sector in response to a public submission filed under the Labor Chapter of the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR). The department also announced a $10 million project to reduce child labor and to improve labor rights and working conditions in the Dominican agriculture sector. Secretary of Labor Thomas E. Perez stated, ""Today we are releasing a report that highlights labor concerns in the Dominican sugar sector and shortcomings in the Dominican government's ability to identify and address them. The report recommends a way forward and notes that we stand ready to help. Working together with the Dominican government, we look forward to making a real difference in these workers' lives."" The report is a response to a submission by Father Christopher Hartley, which alleged that the government of the Dominican Republic failed ""to enforce labor laws, as required under Chapter 16 of the CAFTA-DR, as these relate to the Dominican sugar industry."" The department conducted a detailed review of all information obtained from the government of the Dominican Republic, the submitter, workers, industry and other stakeholders. The report finds evidence of apparent and potential violations of labor law in the Dominican sugar sector, concerning: (1) acceptable conditions of work with respect to minimum wages, hours of work, and occupational safety and health, such as payments below the minimum wage, 12-hour work days, seven-day work weeks, lack of potable water, and the absence of safety equipment; (2) a minimum age for the employment of children and the prohibition and elimination of the worst forms of child labor; and (3) a prohibition on the use of any form of forced or compulsory labor. The report also discusses the department's concerns with respect to freedom of association and collective bargaining. Additionally, it highlights significant procedural and methodological shortcomings in the labor inspection process that undermine the government's capacity to identify labor violations. The report offers 11 recommendations to the government of the Dominican Republic to address the report's findings and improve enforcement of Dominican labor laws in the sugar sector. The Department of Labor will review the status of implementation of the recommendations six months and then 12 months after publication. The Department of Labor is committed to engaging with the government of the Dominican Republic to address the concerns identified in the report and to assisting the government with implementing the report's recommendations. This commitment is evidenced by the $10 million, four-year project that the Department of Labor announced today to reduce child labor and improve labor rights and working conditions in the Dominican agriculture sector. This project builds on many years of Department of Labor's technical assistance to the Dominican Republic, including $16 million in funding since 1998 to eliminate child labor.

"September 26, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20131992,MSHA News Release: MSHA announces results of August impact inspections [09/26/2013],"ARLINGTON, Va. — The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration today announced that federal inspectors issued 213 citations, 23 orders and one safeguard during special impact inspections conducted at nine coal mines and five metal/nonmetal mines last month. The monthly inspections, which began in April 2010 following the explosion at the Upper Big Branch Mine, involve mines that merit increased agency attention and enforcement due to their poor compliance history or particular compliance concerns. These matters include: high numbers of violations or closure orders; frequent hazard complaints or hotline calls; plan compliance issues; inadequate workplace examinations; a high number of accidents, injuries or illnesses; fatalities; adverse conditions, such as increased methane liberation, faulty roof conditions, inadequate ventilation and respirable dust. An impact inspection conducted on Aug. 1 at JJ&E Coal Corp.'s Horse Creek Mine No. 2 in McDowell County, W.Va., resulted in: eight unwarrantable failure orders, one task training order, one imminent danger order and 36 104(a) citations. MSHA enforcement personnel inspected the one producing section, two coal conveyor belts and the surface area of the mine. They also traveled every air course, escapeway and beltline. At the time of the inspection, the day shift production crew was underground on the working section. Because the maintenance crew did not work the previous shift, all conditions observed were as the previous day-shift production crew had left them and after preshift examinations were made. Inspectors found accumulations of loose coal and coal fines up to 30 inches deep the entire length of the two conveyer belts, which were 350 feet and 750 feet long, respectively. Bottom belt rollers on both conveyors turned in these accumulations up to 6 inches deep, a potential fire hazard. These conditions had been documented by the mine superintendent and mine manager during the preshift/on-shift examinations every day for almost a week, noting in daily inspection records since July 27 that each belt ""needs additional cleaning, work in progress."" There was no evidence work had been done to clean these belts. Additionally, MSHA cited the mine operator for violating roof support, ventilation, electrical and surface regulations. Inspectors observed roof bolting machine operators installing roof bolts with no ventilation curtain installed. When tested with chemical smoke, there was no air movement detected. Operating mining machinery without adequate ventilation exposes miners to respirable dust that can lead to black lung, and it can result in accumulations of gas and coal dust that increase the chance of a fire or explosion. MSHA issued an imminent danger order to JJ&E based on its practice of: conducting inadequate mine examinations, failure to provide adequate compliance oversight, failure to comply with approved ventilation and roof control plans, recurring hazardous conditions and the number of citations and orders that were issued in the past year and remained outstanding at the time of this impact inspection. Production was allowed to resume Aug. 13, when all citations and orders associated with the impact inspection were terminated and cited conditions corrected. The operator developed and implemented a compliance plan; and improvements were made to the roof control and ventilation plans. This was the second impact inspection at this mine. ""The types and seriousness of the conditions found at this mine put miners at risk of great harm,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""They cannot and will not be tolerated."" Since April 2010, MSHA has conducted 656 impact inspections and issued 11,002 citations, 1,019 orders and 46 safeguards.

"September 26, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20130926-0,"ETA News Release: US Labor Department awards grants to boost state Unemployment Insurance program integrity, performance and system improvement projects [09/26/2013]","WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Labor today announced awards totaling approximately $176.4 million to 40 state workforce agencies for Unemployment Insurance program integrity, performance and system improvement projects. The grants are intended to: support the prevention and detection of UI improper benefit payments, improve state performance and address outdated information technology system infrastructures necessary to improve UI program integrity. Included in these awards are three state consortia grants totaling approximately $98.8 million for projects designed to improve overall program quality, performance and integrity. ""The Unemployment Insurance program is a critical lifeline for those experiencing tough financial times. It helps families keep a roof over their heads, food on the table and provides a boost to the local economy,"" said Secretary of Labor Thomas E. Perez. ""The grants announced today will support state efforts to ensure the program runs efficiently, so that it can remain in place for individuals and families in the future."" To qualify for program integrity funding, states must have implemented or committed to implement a set of core integrity activities. These grant awards support business process analyses to identify areas of weakness that may contribute to improper payments and then design ways to improve performance; promote the implementation and expansion of the State Information Data Exchange System, commonly referred to as SIDES; ensure the implementation of state-identified prevention strategies to prevent improper payments before they occur; and continue the operation of a Cross-Functional Integrity Task Force. Three grants are being awarded to consortia involving nine states for projects designed to improve overall program quality, accountability, performance and integrity. The consortia approach minimizes the cost of multiple states implementing expensive system redesigns while achieving important program integrity functionality. Consortia grants will be used to design and implement UI tax or benefit systems, as well as implement technology-based tools to prevent, detect and recover improper UI payments. Past consortia grants have resulted in new software solutions that incorporate important integrity functions, such as improved cross-matching, and the integration of SIDES to facilitate communication between states and employers regarding individual eligibility.

"September 26, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20130926-1,ETA News Release: More than $18.5 million in Disability Employment Initiative grants awarded by US Labor Department to eight states [09/26/2013],"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Labor today announced grants totaling $18,597,758 to eight states to provide education, training and employment opportunities for youth and adults with disabilities. The grants are part of the Disability Employment Initiative, a program jointly funded and administered by the department's Employment and Training Administration and Office of Disability Employment Policy. ""To thrive in the competitive international marketplace, employers need access to a diverse pool of qualified job seekers,"" said Secretary of Labor Thomas E. Perez. ""These federal grants expand that pool and show our commitment to creating career pathways and employment opportunities that result in economic self-sufficiency for people with disabilities."" This is the fourth round of the Disability Employment Initiative, which currently supports 23 projects. Three new states — Alabama, Connecticut and Idaho — are being awarded in this round, while the remaining five states — Alaska, Illinois, Maine, New York and Virginia — are receiving additional funding to expand and replicate the best practices they developed using DEI funds beginning as recipients in the first round of the program. The DEI-funded projects are required to: 1) hire/designate a Disability Resource Coordinator, with disability and workforce expertise, who will work at the local workforce investment board level; 2) verify American Job Center compliance with physical, programmatic and communications accessibility; 3) participate in Social Security's Ticket to Work Program as active Employment Networks (i.e., assign a Ticket); and 5) participate in rigorous evaluation of the DEI program. ""This funding will provide a range of training and employment services to people with disabilities, and it expands the capacity of the public workforce system to serve them,"" said Eric M. Seleznow, acting assistant secretary of labor for employment and training. All projects under this initiative build upon previous department initiatives, such as hiring staff with expertise in disability and workforce issues. The grants support extensive partnerships and collaboration across multiple workforce and disability service systems in each state, including: vocational rehabilitation, mental health, intellectual/developmental disability agencies, independent living centers, business leadership networks, and other community and nonprofit organizations. ""Access to quality employment and training services is vital to getting youth and adults with disabilities into the workforce and putting them on a career path to good jobs in high-growth, high-demand industries,"" said Kathy Martinez, assistant secretary of labor for disability employment policy. The Disability Employment Initiative expands the public workforce system's participation in the Social Security Administration's Ticket to Work Program by requiring participating state workforce agencies or local workforce investment boards to become active Employment Networks. Many Supplemental Security Income and Social Security Disability Insurance beneficiaries use the mainstream workforce system to seek employment opportunities. By serving as Employment Networks, grantees will build upon American Job Center network's capacity to serve Social Security beneficiaries with disabilities.

"September 25, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/owcp/owcp20130925,OWCP News Release: US Department of Labor publishes final rule implementing the Byrd Amendments to Black Lung Benefits Act [09/25/2013],"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Labor's Office of Workers' Compensation Programs today announced the final rule implementing amendments to the Black Lung Benefits Act passed by Congress in 2010. Commonly called the Byrd Amendments after their sponsor, the late Senator Robert C. Byrd, the amendments re-instate two provisions regarding coal miners' and survivors' entitlement to benefits that had been eliminated in 1981. ""Many miners disabled by black lung disease and their survivors will receive critical benefits as a result of the Byrd Amendments,"" said Gary A. Steinberg, acting director of OWCP. ""The final rules implementing these vital provisions assist the coal-mining community by clarifying how the amendments operate."" The first amendment mandates a presumption of total disability or death caused by pneumoconiosis for coal miners who worked for at least 15 years in underground (or comparable surface) mining and who suffer or suffered from a totally disabling respiratory impairment. The second amendment provides automatic entitlement for eligible survivors of miners who were themselves entitled to receive benefits as a result of a lifetime claim. The re-instated amendments are 30 United States Code 921(c)(4) and 30 U.S.C. 932(l); and they are contained in Section 1556 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and apply to claims filed after Jan. 1, 2005, that are pending on or after March 23, 2010. The final rule addresses the automatic entitlement of certain survivors and the 15-year entitlement presumption as it applies to miners' and their survivors' claims. In addition, the rule eliminates several unnecessary or obsolete provisions in accordance with Executive Order 13563. The final rule was published in the Federal Register, and it can be viewed at https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2013/09/25/2013-22874/regulations-implementing-the-byrd-amendments-to-the-black-lung-benefits-act-determining-coal-miners (link is external) . The mission of the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs is to protect the interests of workers who are injured or become ill on the job, their families and their employers. This mission is accomplished by: making timely, appropriate and accurate decisions on claims; providing prompt payment of benefits and helping injured workers return to gainful work as early as is feasible. The Division of Coal Mine Workers' Compensation administers claims filed under the Black Lung Benefits Act. This law provides compensation to coal miners who are totally disabled by pneumoconiosis arising out of coal mine employment, eligible survivors of miners whose death was attributable to or hastened by pneumoconiosis, and survivors of miners who were entitled to benefits at the time of their death. The BLBA also provides eligible miners with medical coverage for the treatment of lung diseases arising out of coal mine employment. For more information, visit http://www.dol.gov/owcp/dcmwc/ ."
"September 25, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20131970,MSHA News Release: MSHA releases guide for miners' representatives [09/25/2013],"ARLINGTON, Va. — The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration announced today the availability of a guide for miners' representatives, which will be available as a handbook and an online resource. The ""Miners' Representative Guide"" is a comprehensive tool that expands upon the ""Guide to Miners' Rights and Responsibilities"" released by the agency in June 2011. ""A good safety and health program depends upon the active participation and interest of everyone at the worksite,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""In order to help decrease workplace deaths, injuries, and illnesses, miners and their representatives must have sufficient knowledge of their rights so that they can fully and properly exercise them."" According to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, Congress specifically intended that, when a miners' representative is designated, he be included in many important aspects of mine safety and health: traveling with and assisting federal inspectors, filing hazard complaints, participating in modification of mandatory safety standards and playing a role in litigation procedures under the Mine Act. A miners' representative is any person, group or organization designated by two or more miners to represent their interest during health and safety enforcement processes at their mine. The new guide provides detailed information about: reporting hazardous conditions and imminent dangers, accident investigations, understanding the elements of discrimination under Section 105(c) of the Mine Act, health and safety training, petitions for modification of a safety standard, rights to information and records, civil penalties and requests under the Freedom of Information Act. Section 105(c) of the Mine Act prohibits discrimination against miners, applicants for employment and representatives of miners for exercising statutory rights, which include protected safety or health activities such as identifying hazards, requesting MSHA inspections or refusing to engage in unsafe work. A number of issues relating to fears of discrimination and retaliation came to light during congressional hearings held in the wake of the Upper Big Branch Mine disaster. Statements from miners and family members of the miners who died indicated that mine employees had been reluctant to speak out about safety conditions in existence prior to the April 2010 explosion, fearing retaliation by management. In 2012, the department filed 46 requests for temporary re-instatement with the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission on behalf of miners who submitted complaints of discrimination in the form of a suspension, layoff, discharge or other adverse action — more than double any previous year. Also in 2012, the department filed a record 34 complaints alleging mine safety discrimination.

Chapman has ordered Bank of America Corp. to pay 1,147 African American job applicants $ 2,181,593 in back wages and interest for race-based hiring discrimination at the company's Charlotte facility. In an earlier ruling, the judge determined that the bank applied unfair and inconsistent selection criteria resulting in the rejection of qualified African American applicants for teller and entry-level clerical and administrative positions. The ruling represents a major victory in a case that has spanned nearly two decades, during which Bank of America repeatedly challenged the authority of the department's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs. Bank of America is a federally-insured financial institution that provides a variety services and products, making it a federal contractor under the purview of OFCCP's regulatory requirements. ""Wherever doors of opportunity are unfairly closed to workers, we will be there to open them — no matter how long it takes,"" said OFCCP Director Patricia A. Shiu. ""Judge Chapman's decision upholds the legal principle of making victims of discrimination whole, and these workers deserve to get the full measure of what is owed to them."" The ruling awards $964,033 to 1,034 applicants who were rejected for jobs in 1993 and $1,217,560 to 113 individuals who were rejected between 2002 and 2005. It further orders Bank of America to extend job offers, with appropriate seniority, to 10 class members as positions become available. After hearing from experts on both sides, the judge agreed with the government's positions on every issue in dispute. Notably, she rejected the bank's arguments for a lower award on the grounds that they could not take advantage of missing records that they had failed to keep. On Nov. 24, 1993, OFCCP initiated a routine compliance review that revealed indications of systemic hiring discrimination affecting African American job seekers at the Charlotte facility. After conciliation efforts failed, the Solicitor of Labor in 1997 filed an administrative complaint against the company for violating Executive Order 11246, which prohibits federal contractors from discriminating in employment practices on the basis of race. ""Our investigators and attorneys prevailed despite decades of stalling tactics,"" said Solicitor of Labor M. Patricia Smith. ""This case demonstrates that the department will not be deterred in our pursuit of justice for job seekers."" In addition to Executive Order 11246, OFCCP enforces Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974. These three laws require those who do business with the federal government, both contractors and subcontractors, to follow the fair and reasonable standard that they not discriminate in employment on the basis of sex, race, color, religion, national origin, disability or status as a protected veteran.

In court filings, OFCCP alleged that Medtronic, a federal contractor, discriminated against 78 entry-level Hispanic senior production associates by paying them less than their white counterparts, in violation of Executive Order 11246. OFCCP also filed a consent decree memorializing the settlement with the Labor Department's Office of Administrative Law Judges after the company agreed to resolve the claims. ""Pay discrimination robs workers of the wages they deserve and takes from their families countless opportunities they might have had,"" said OFCCP Director Patricia A. Shiu. ""Because pay discrimination is often hidden from workers, OFCCP's enforcement in this area is essential. I am pleased that we were able to work with Medtronic to finally resolve this case, provide compensation to the affected workers and fix the pay practices that led to this disparity in the first place."" Under the terms of the consent decree, Medtronic will pay the affected workers $290,000 in back wages and interest for pay disparities dating back to April 2008. Furthermore, the company will conduct training on its equal employment opportunity programs for all people involved in making decisions about compensation at the Danvers facility, and ensure that all of their pay practices fully comply with the law.

Under this model, independent investors provide the financial capital to cover the operating costs for the programs, and the Department of Labor disburses funds when and if those programs demonstrate that they have achieved the targeted outcomes. Two grants were awarded: one to the New York Department of Labor in the amount of $12,000,000 and the other to the Massachusetts Executive Office of Labor and Workforce Development in the amount of $11,670,000. These grants will support programming that aims to increase employment and reduce recidivism among formerly incarcerated individuals. ""The Pay for Success model is a promising strategy for expanding effective programs while ensuring maximum return on taxpayer dollars,"" said Secretary of Labor Thomas E. Perez. ""At a time when all levels of government are experiencing cutbacks, Pay for Success offers a new approach to strategically leverage resources to provide essential services for vulnerable populations through programs with measurable success rates."" The grants announced today represent amounts of committed funds, which the department will release in installments based on whether the grant outcomes were met. Both grantees are expected to employ rigorous evaluation methods in gauging the results of their respective programs, and the findings will be reviewed by independent validators at the end of grant performance period. The robust evaluation component incorporated in Pay for Success projects will also help to: 1) the expand the body of knowledge about the intervention strategies being tested, 2) demonstrate the feasibility and viability of this funding model and 3) use taxpayer dollars wisely by shifting the investment risk to private investors and releasing funding based on results. The original solicitation for Pay for Success grant applications announced that $20 million would be awarded. Because of the quality of applications received, the department elected to fully fund the top two grant applicants’ projects using funds from fiscal years 2012 and 2013.

"September 18, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20131859,"MSHA News Release: MSHA, engineering firm reach settlement in deadly 2007 Utah mine collapse [09/18/2013]","ARLINGTON, Va. — The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration announced today that it submitted a settlement between MSHA and Agapito Associates Inc. in the August 2007 Crandall Canyon Mine disaster to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission. Under the settlement agreement, the mining engineering consulting firm accepted responsibility and agreed to pay $100,000 for a high negligence violation for its role in the mine collapse that killed six miners and three rescue workers at Genwal Resources Inc.'s underground coal mine in Emery County, Utah. According to MSHA's investigation, the miners were killed when roof-supporting coal pillars collapsed in a catastrophic outburst that violently ejected coal over a half-mile area in the underground mine tunnels. Ten days later, two mine employees and an MSHA inspector died in another coal outburst that occurred during rescue efforts. The investigation also determined that the flawed engineering analysis by Agapito resulted in an inadequate mine design, with unsafe pillar dimensions, which contributed to the accident. Genwal and its parent company, UtahAmerican Energy Inc. submitted their mining plan to MSHA based on Agapito's analysis. ""With this settlement, Agapito takes responsibility for its role in the tragic mine collapse at Crandall Canyon,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""Since this tragedy occurred, the agency has made a number of enforcement, administrative and regulatory reforms to improve the health and safety of the nation's miners, particularly in the area of roof control safety."" If approved by the administrative law judge, the settlement will mark the end of legal proceedings brought by the federal government arising from the 2007 mine disaster. In September 2012, Genwal Resources and Andalex Resources Inc., also owned by UtahAmerican Energy, agreed to pay nearly $950,000 in civil penalties for Crandall Canyon violations. In addition, Genwal Resources pled guilty in federal court to two criminal misdemeanors for its willful violation of mandatory health and safety standards at the mine and agreed to pay a $500,000 fine."
"September 18, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20130918,ETA News Release: Obama administration announces $474.5 million in  grants to expand demand-driven skills training and strengthen employer partnerships [09/18/2013],"Grants are third installment of nearly $2 billion community college initiative WASHINGTON — Secretary of Labor Thomas E. Perez today announced $474.5 million in grants to community colleges and universities around the country for the development and expansion of innovative training programs in partnership with local employers. The grants are part of the Trade Adjustment Assistance Community College and Career Training grant program, a multiyear, nearly $2 billion initiative to expand targeted training programs for unemployed workers, especially those impacted by foreign trade. The 57 grants announced today will support 190 projects in at least 183 schools in every state plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. The grants will expand programs in growing industries, such as advanced manufacturing, transportation and health care, and encourage geographic and industry sector collaboration through the development of both statewide and multistate college consortia. The U.S. Department of Labor is implementing and administering the program in coordination with the U.S. Department of Education. All course materials developed using these public funds will be available through the Open Educational Resources initiative so that others can access and build on successful training models. The U.S. Department of Commerce is also encouraging employers to collaborate with local colleges eligible for funding through this program. This latest round of funding is fostering deeper partnerships between community colleges, employers and other community partners. This year's grantees have more employer partners than in the past, and many of those employer partners will offer work-based learning opportunities. At least 10 of the individual grants will be focused on these work-based training opportunities and many consortia grants will incorporate similar strategies into their programs. Strong partnerships and work-based training will help ensure that curricula and training are aligned with the practical skills and competencies industries seek from workers. Speaking in Colorado at Front Range Community College — the lead college in a $25 million grant to a consortium of nine schools across the state focused on developing a pipeline of skilled advanced manufacturing workers — Secretary Perez said: ""These investments in demand-driven skills training bring together education, labor, business and community leaders to meet the real-world needs of the changing global marketplace. These partnerships strengthen not only the American workforce, but the American economy as well."" The initiative complements President Obama's broader goals of ensuring that every American has at least one year of postsecondary education, and that the U.S. has the highest proportion of college graduates in the world by 2020. The program is designed to have a lasting impact on higher education, emphasizing the use of evidence-based program design, collection of student outcome data and evaluation to add to the growing body of knowledge about which strategies best develop skills that lead to good jobs. This year's grants also build on the administration's goal of providing individuals with the information they need to choose education and training programs that fits their needs. The 11 single-state consortia grantees will be required to use graduate employment and earnings data to improve their programming and to create employment results scorecards that will help prospective students make informed choices about training programs. ""Community colleges play a vital role in training Americans to meet the needs of employers today,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan. ""As our economy continues to rebuild, businesses are looking for employees with the skills their company needs to stay competitive, and America's students and adult workers want to be equipped to fill those roles. These grants help to meet those demands, providing critical investments in education and supporting key partnerships."" The grants include 20 awards to community college and university consortia totaling $377,452,319 and 23 awards to individual institutions totaling $61,943,218. Fourteen states and territories, which were not funded through the competitive award process, will develop a qualifying project and receive an approximately $2.5 million grant. ""For America's workforce to be competitive in the 21st century, our workers must possess the skills employers need for their businesses to succeed. That is why employers should partner with educational institutions and government to help develop curriculum and credentialing programs at the local level,"" said U.S. Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker. ""This round of grants has an increased emphasis on creating the types of training programs that will prepare community college students for the jobs in which they are needed, which is good for employees, employers and the strength of our economy."" Grantees will use these funds to transform the way they schedule, sequence and deliver education and training programs that can be completed in two years or less. A variety of activities will be made possible, including: hiring or training instructors to expand capacity to offer in-demand courses or certifications, leveraging online learning to accelerate skills attainment, developing new curricula and training models to add additional classes and certifications, purchasing new equipment to ensure students train on what employers actually use, designing new programs based on the input and needs of local employers, and expanding career pathways in which stackable credentials are linked to industry skills and lead participants to higher-skill jobs. Grantees in this round were also required to demonstrate: local labor market need for enhanced training in specific industries; strong engagement with employers in the design and delivery of training activities and work-based learning; a commitment to evidence-based program design and rigorous third-party evaluation; the use of stacked and latticed credentials; a clear plan for the transferability and articulation of course credit, application of advanced online and technology-enabled learning; strategic alignment with the workforce system, philanthropic organizations and other community partners; and the ability to leverage previously funded TAACCCT projects.

"September 18, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20131720,EBSA News Release: New guidance issued by US Labor Department on same-sex marriages and employee benefit plans [09/18/2013],"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Labor today announced new guidance interpreting the Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Windsor . In a technical release, the department's Employee Benefits Security Administration provides guidance to plans, plan sponsors, fiduciaries, participants and beneficiaries on the decision's impact on the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. The release states that, in general, the terms ""spouse"" and ""marriage"" in Title I of ERISA and in related department regulations should be read to include same-sex couples legally married in any state or foreign jurisdiction that recognizes such marriages, regardless of where they currently live. On June 26, 2013, the Windsor decision struck down the provisions of the Defense of Marriage Act that denied federal benefits to legally married, same-sex couples. ""This decision represents a historic step toward equality for all American families, and I have directed the department's agency heads to ensure that they are implementing the decision in a way that provides maximum protection for workers and their families,"" said Secretary of Labor Thomas E. Perez. ""The department plans to issue additional guidance in the coming months as we continue to consult with the Department of Justice and other federal agencies to implement the decision."" ""By providing greater clarity on how the Supreme Court's decision affects one of the laws we enforce, we are contributing to greater equality and greater protection for America's working families,"" said Assistant Secretary for Employee Benefits Security Phyllis C. Borzi. EBSA protects the retirement, health and other workplace-related benefits of America's workers, retirees and their families. The agency oversees approximately 701,000 private sector retirement plans, 2.3 million health plans and other plans that provide benefits to more than 141 million Americans. Collectively, these plans hold more than $7.3 trillion in assets. Additional information can be found at www.dol.gov/ebsa/ .

"September 17, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20130917,"WHD News Release: Minimum wage, overtime protections extended to direct care workers by US Labor Department [09/17/2013]","WASHINGTON — Fulfilling a promise by President Obama to ensure that direct care workers receive a fair day's pay for a fair day's work, the U.S. Department of Labor announced a final rule today extending the Fair Labor Standards Act's minimum wage and overtime protections to most of the nation's workers who provide essential home care assistance to elderly people and people with illnesses, injuries or disabilities. This change will result in nearly two million direct care workers — such as home health aides, personal care aides and certified nursing assistants — receiving the same basic protections already provided to most U.S. workers. It will also help guarantee that those who rely on the assistance of direct care workers have access to consistent and high-quality care from a stable and increasingly professional workforce. ""Many American families rely on the vital services provided by direct care workers,"" said Secretary of Labor Thomas E. Perez. ""Because of their hard work, countless Americans are able to live independently, go to work and participate more fully in their communities. Today we are taking an important step toward guaranteeing that these professionals receive the wage protections they deserve while protecting the right of individuals to live at home."" ""Direct care workers play a critical role in ensuring access to high-quality home care that many people need in order to remain healthy and independent in their communities, and they should be compensated fairly for this important work,"" said Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius. ""We will continue to engage with consumers, states, advocates and home care providers in the implementation of this rule to help people with disabilities, older adults and their families receive quality, person-centered services."" The home care industry has grown dramatically over the last several decades as more Americans choose to receive long-term care at home instead of in nursing homes or other facilities. Despite this growth and the fact that direct care workers increasingly receive skills training and perform work previously done by trained nurses, direct care workers remain among the lowest paid in the service industry. There are an estimated 1.9 million direct care workers in the U.S., with nearly all currently employed by home care agencies. Approximately 90 percent of direct care workers are women, and nearly 50 percent are minorities. Today's announcement extends minimum wage and overtime protections to all direct care workers employed by home care agencies and other third parties. Fifteen states already extend state minimum wage and overtime protections to direct care workers, and an additional six states and the District of Columbia mandate state minimum wage protections. ""The department carefully considered the comments received from individuals who receive home care, workers, third-party employers and administrators of state programs that support home care,"" said Laura Fortman, the principal deputy administrator of the Wage and Hour Division, the agency that administers and enforces the FLSA. ""In response, the final rule provides increased flexibility, and gives programs sufficient time to make any needed adjustments. Together these changes will allow the rule to better meet consumers' needs while better protecting direct care workers."" The final rule also clarifies that direct care workers who perform medically-related services for which training is typically a prerequisite are not companionship workers and therefore are entitled to the minimum wage and overtime. And, in accordance with Congress' initial intent, individual workers who are employed only by the person receiving services or that person's family or household and engaged primarily in fellowship and protection (providing company, visiting or engaging in hobbies) and care incidental to such activities, will still be considered exempt from the FLSA's minimum wage and overtime protections. The rule will be effective Jan. 1, 2015. The Department of Labor has created a new web portal with interactive web tools, fact sheets and other materials to help families, other employers and workers understand the new requirements.

"September 16, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20130916-0,OSHA News Release: $10.1 million in Susan Harwood safety and health training grants awarded to 70 organizations by US Department of Labor's OSHA [09/16/2013],"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration today awarded $10.1 million through the Susan Harwood Training Grant Program to 70 nonprofit, community and faith-based organizations; employer associations; labor unions; joint labor and management associations; and colleges and universities. This program provides one-year grants to fund education and training programs for workers and employers to help them: recognize workplace safety and health hazards, implement injury prevention measures and inform them of their rights and responsibilities. ""These grants reflect the department's commitment to ensuring all workers and employers have the tools and skills to identify hazards and prevent injuries,"" said Secretary of Labor Thomas E. Perez. ""By further advancing a culture of workplace safety and health, we help to eliminate the false choice between enhancing workplace safety and productivity."" The program supports in-person, hands-on training, educational programs and guidance on creating training materials. Some of the intended beneficiaries of these additional resources for training are: small-business employers; workers and employers in industries with high injury and fatality rates; and vulnerable workers, including those who are young, have limited English proficiency and are difficult to reach. Approximately $1.6 million in targeted training grants have been awarded to 18 organizations not included in the FY 2012 program. OSHA has designated the following topics: fall protection in construction; agricultural safety, including grain handling operations; hair and nail salon hazards; ergonomic hazards; hazard communication for chemical exposure; injury and illness prevention programs; and workplace violence. OSHA also awarded approximately $8.5 million in follow-on grants to 52 of the FY 2012 capacity building developmental grantees that performed satisfactorily during the last year and submitted awardable applications this year. These grantees demonstrated their ability to provide occupational safety and health training, education, and related assistance to workers and employers in high-hazard industries as well as small-business employers and vulnerable workers. They are expected to institutionalize organizational capacity to provide safety and health training on an ongoing basis. ""The programs funded by these grants are one of the most effective resources we have for providing important hands-on training and education to hard-to-reach workers in small businesses and dangerous jobs,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for OSHA Dr. David Michaels. These 70 awards follow the recently granted $1.2 million in Susan Harwood Training Grants under the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act of 2013 to assist workers and employers engaged in Hurricane Sandy recovery and cleanup efforts in affected areas in New Jersey and New York. The five nonprofit organizations that received grants are: Communication Workers of America District One, Education and Training Institute Inc., National Day Laborer Organizing Network, New York Committee for Occupational Safety and Health and the Work Environment Council of New Jersey. Over the past several months, grantees developed training materials and have been using the awarded grants to fund training and education to 5,600 workers and employers, and they will continue to do so over the next 13 months. The Susan Harwood Training Grant Program is an essential component of OSHA's efforts to provide workers in high-risk industries with training about job hazards and their rights. Since 1978, approximately 1.9 million workers have been trained through this program. The training grant program is named in honor of Susan Harwood, a former director of the Office of Risk Assessment in OSHA's former Directorate of Health Standards, who passed away in 1996.

"September 16, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20130916,OSHA News Release: US Labor Department's OSHA working with agriculture community [09/16/2013],"Agriculture industry records highest fatality rates of any industry WASHINGTON — The agriculture sector accounted for 475 deaths in 2012. With a fatality rate of 21.2 per 100,000 full-time equivalent workers, agriculture recorded the highest fatality rate of any industry sector. Additionally, 48,300 injuries were recorded in 2011, the last year for which statistics are available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This sector employs more than 2 million people in the United States. The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration is supporting the National Education Center for Agricultural Safety's National Farm Safety & Health Week, Sept. 15-21, by emphasizing the importance of worker safety in the agricultural industry. The theme for this year's National Farm Safety & Health Week is ""Working Together for Safety in Agriculture."" ""By working together to protect agricultural workers from job hazards and assuring that workers have the right to safety training, we can all make a positive impact on the lives of agricultural workers,"" said Dr. David Michaels, assistant secretary of labor for occupational safety and health. ""OSHA has worked diligently with agri-businesses, farm agencies and communities in recent years to increase awareness of the hazards of confined spaces, farm equipment, grain handling and other hazards in the this industry in an effort to promote safety and health on America's farms."" Farm Safety and Health Week has been observed annually since 1944 during September as farmers prepare for harvest. The National Education Center for Agricultural Safety has posted informational safety and health materials on its website at www.necasag.org. (link is external) Farmworkers are at high risk for: fatal and nonfatal injuries, work-related lung diseases, heat exposure, noise-induced hearing loss, skin diseases and certain cancers associated with chemical use and prolonged sun exposure. OSHA has additional information available on its website regarding specific agricultural hazards located at https://www.osha.gov/dsg/topics/agriculturaloperations/index.html. Additionally, record numbers of deaths and injuries in 2010 led OSHA to develop a Local Emphasis Program for Grain Handling Facilities, focusing on the grain and feed industry's six major hazards including: engulfment, falls, auger entanglement, ""struck by,"" combustible dust explosions and electrocution hazards. In 2010, at least 26 U.S. workers were killed in grain engulfments, the highest number on record. OSHA has published information related to common grain industry hazards and abatement methods, proper bin entry techniques, sweep auger use and many other grain related topics at www.osha.gov/SLTC/grainhandling/index.html . The Grain Bin LEP is used in 25 states. The Grain Handling Safety Coalition can also provide all the necessary training materials to train farmers, commercial grain handling employees, youth, rescue workers and more for free or at a very reduced rate. There are five different safety topics available including an overview of grain handling and storage safety, grain bin entry as well as entanglement, fall and confined space hazards. GHSC also offers ""Train the Trainer"" courses for companies and communities to have a local resource for training. More information is available at www.grainsafety.org. (link is external) Information is also available on the employment of youths in agriculture at https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/youth/agriculture/index.html. Approximately one half of farmworkers are Hispanic. OSHA requires that employers conduct all required training of workers in a language and vocabulary workers can understand. OSHA's Spanish-language outreach resources, which detail how employers can work cooperatively with OSHA, are: Hispanic Outreach Module of Compliance Assistance Quick Start, available at: https://www.osha.gov/dcsp/compliance_assistance/quickstarts/hispanic/index_hispanic.html Spanish-Language Compliance Assistance Resources, available at: https://www.osha.gov/dcsp/compliance_assistance/index_hispanic.html and Podemos Ayudar (We Can Help), available at: https://www.osha.gov/as/opa/spanish/index.html To ask questions, obtain compliance assistance; file a complaint, or report workplace hospitalizations, fatalities or situations posing imminent danger to workers, the public should call OSHA's toll-free hotline at 800-321-OSHA (6742).

"September 12, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20131854,"OSHA News Release: Taylors Drain and Sewer Service cited by US Labor Departments OSHA after worker injured in trench collapse at Lincoln, Neb., job site  [09/12/2013]","LINCOLN, Neb. — Taylor's Drain and Sewer Service has been cited by the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration for 10 safety violations, including two willful. OSHA found that the company failed to protect workers from cave-ins during trenching operations at two separate jobs sites in Lincoln, leading to a worker suffering a serious injury. OSHA has proposed penalties of $194,000. On March 22 at 5600 S. 90th St., a worker was buried waist-deep when a trench approximately 9-feet-deep collapsed, and he required surgery to recover from his injuries. And on April 11 at a separate job site located at 4530 Adams St., two other workers were observed in a 10-foot-deep trench without protection. Taylor's Drain and Sewer Service Inc. was installing water and sewer lines at both locations in Lincoln. ""Cave — ins are the leading cause of injury and death during excavations,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health Dr. David Michaels. ""Taylor Drain and Sewer Service failed to provide basic safety precautions, which led to the serious injury of one of its workers. This employer had no excuse for noncompliance."" At 5600 S. 90th St. job site, the company was cited for six serious violations, including failing to: develop and implement a written hazardous communication program, provide workers with hazard recognition training, protect workers from exposed underground utilities, provide a means of safe access and egress during trenching and excavation work, provide a competent person for trench inspection prior to worker entry and provide trench cave-in protection. An OSHA violation is serious if death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard an employer knew or should have known existed. During OSHA's inspection at the 4530 Adams St. job site, two willful and two serious violations were cited. The willful violations involve failing to provide cave-in protection to workers in a trench more than 5-feet-deep and to provide a competent person for trench inspection prior to worker entry. A willful violation is one committed with intentional, knowing or voluntary disregard for the law's requirement or plain indifference to employee safety and health. The two serious violations cited include failing to provide a means of safe access and egress during trenching and excavation work and to protect workers from struck-by hazards, including spoil piles of soil placed less than two feet from the edge of the trench. Only two workers were at this job site. OSHA standards mandate that all excavations 5-feet or deeper be protected against collapse. Detailed information on trenching and excavation hazards is available at http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/trenchingexcavation/index.html . The citations can be viewed at: http://www.osha.gov/ooc/citations/TaylorsDrain_897301_0912_13.pdf and http://www.osha.gov/ooc/citations/TaylorsDrain_900012_0912_13.pdf . OSHA has placed Taylor's Drain and Sewer Services Inc. in its Severe Violator Enforcement Program as a result of these inspections. The program mandates targeted follow-up inspections to ensure compliance with the law. The program focuses on recalcitrant employers that endanger workers by committing willful, repeat or failure-to-abate violations. The company has 15 business days from receipt of the citations to comply, request an informal conference with OSHA's area director or contest the citations and penalties before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. To ask questions, obtain compliance assistance; file a complaint or report workplace hospitalizations, fatalities or situations posing imminent danger to workers, the public should call OSHA's toll-free hotline at 800-321-OSHA (6742) or the agency's Omaha, Neb., office at 402-553-0171. Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees.

"September 12, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ofccp/ofccp20130912,OFCCP News Release: Spokane home care operator settles US Labor Department charges of discrimination against male job seekers [09/12/2013],"SEATTLE — The U.S. Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs announced today that it has entered into a conciliation agreement to resolve allegations of sex discrimination by federal contractor, ResCare HomeCare Spokane. OFCCP investigators determined that ResCare's selection process violated Executive Order 11246 because it led to systemic hiring discrimination affecting men who applied for in-home care positions between June 2009 and May 2010. The investigation concluded that 77 male job applicants were denied full consideration during the hiring process. ""When we tell our daughters that there are no limits to what jobs they can pursue, we should be mindful that those same aspirations apply to our sons,"" said OFCCP Director Patricia A. Shiu. ""Outdated stereotypes about women being better suited to caregiving jobs than men perpetuate unlawful and unfair sex discrimination. At OFCCP, we are committed to combating sex stereotyping whenever it gets in the way of equal employment opportunities for qualified workers."" Though ResCare officials asserted that most of their clients are women and requested female caregivers, the company had no evidence to support this. An overwhelming majority of client care plans contained no gender preference, and when OFCCP contacted a sample of these clients to ask whether they had a gender preference for their caregiver, nearly half of the female clients indicated that they had no gender preference. Under the terms of the agreement, the company will pay a total of $92,059 in back pay and interest to 77 rejected male applicants. ResCare has also agreed to hire eight members of the affected class as in-home care positions become available. Additionally, the federal contractor agreed to immediately correct any discriminatory practices and undertake extensive self-monitoring measures to ensure that all compensation practices fully comply with the law. ResCare provides homecare services and in-home senior care, including nursing, therapy, personal care, Alzheimer and dementia care, homemaking, companionship and other services. The Spokane facility is a part of ResCare Inc., based in Louisville, Ky., and it holds approximately $100 million in contracts with the Labor Department's Employment and Training Administration to operate 15 Job Corps centers across the country and is the program's second largest center operator in the nation. In addition to Executive Order 11246, OFCCP enforces Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974. These three laws require those who do business with the federal government, both contractors and subcontractors, to follow the fair and reasonable standard that they not discriminate in employment on the basis of sex, race, color, religion, national origin, disability or status as a protected veteran.

The court held that an MSHA district manager has broad discretion to disapprove a mine operator's proposed ventilation plan for an underground coal mine, and may do so as long as the decision is not arbitrary and capricious. The court rejected the contention that an operator may ask the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission to substitute its judgment for MSHA's in approving or disapproving a ventilation plan MSHA determines is inadequate to address health and safety requirements and the particular conditions of the mine. ""Both the commission and the Court of Appeals recognized that it is appropriate to leave determinations on the sufficiency of highly technical mine plans to MSHA,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""We believe the court made the appropriate decision in this case."" At issue in the case was a ventilation plan proposed by Mach Mining LLC for its # 1 Mine, an underground coal mine in Williamson County, Ill. Despite extended good-faith discussions by MSHA, the parties were not able to reach agreement on the contents of the plan. Following a hearing, an administrative law judge ruled that: the district manager had negotiated in good faith, the district manager's decision to withhold approval of the plan was not arbitrary and capricious, he had not abused his discretion in determining that the plan was unsuitable and the changes to the plan requested by the district manager were suitable. After Mach Mining appealed the administrative law judge's ruling, a 3-2 majority of the commission affirmed. Mach Mining subsequently filed a petition to the Court of Appeals for review, and the Court of Appeals denied Mach Mining's petition and affirmed the commission's decision."

"September 6, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20131842,OPA News Release: Statement of Labor Secretary Perez on August employment numbers [09/06/2013],"WASHINGTON — Secretary of Labor Thomas E. Perez issued the following statement about the August 2013 Employment Situation report released today: ""This morning's report tells a story of an economy slowly and steadily continuing to heal, with 169,000 new jobs added in August. We have now had 42 straight months of private-sector job growth, with nearly 7.5 million private-sector jobs created over that time. The unemployment rate (7.3 percent) continues to remain stable and has now been below 8 percent for twelve consecutive months. ""Many sectors are showing renewed signs of life, as we see job growth across the board. In August, there were notable increases in retail trade (+44,000) and education and health services (+43,000). ""But we have to do more to pick up the pace of this recovery. We are not satisfied with an economy performing at anything less than its full potential. President Obama has proposed a better bargain for the middle class that will invigorate the economy and create jobs at a faster clip. It includes strong investments in education, manufacturing and infrastructure — both our physical infrastructure, like roads and bridges; and our human capital infrastructure, the skills and talents of our people. ""During this week when we honored the dignity and resilience of American workers on Labor Day, let's all rededicate ourselves to building an economy worthy of their sacrifice. What keeps me up at night is the reality that too many people are finding the rungs on the ladder of opportunity further and further apart. We don't have a spare American. My job as Labor Secretary is to make sure we have a labor market that utilizes the skills of all our people, allowing everyone to reach their highest and best dreams."""
"September 5, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20131717,"OSHA News Release: Adams Thermal Systems to pay $1.33 million to resolve OSHA citations, criminal penalties in 2011 death of worker at South Dakota plant [09/05/2013]","CANTON, S.D. — Adams Thermal Systems Inc. has entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Attorney's Office and the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration to pay more than $1.33 million to resolve criminal penalties and OSHA fines levied as a result of the death of a worker on Nov. 7, 2011, in the company's Canton plant. The U.S. Attorney's Office filed the Deferred Prosecution Agreement on Sept. 5, 2013, and has asked that it be approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of South Dakota. Under the terms of the agreement, the company will pay the worker's surviving spouse $450,000, a criminal fine of $450,000 and the full OSHA fine of $435,000 stemming from the regulatory violations that caused the fatality and additional violations discovered in subsequent inspections. OSHA's investigation found the worker was fatally crushed in a machine used to make radiator cores, after management instructed and authorized workers to bypass the manufacturer's barrier guard in order to adjust the machine to keep it running. OSHA also conducted two concurrent safety and health investigations at the company in February 2012, which resulted in 66 violations. ""Adams Thermal failed to provide a safe workplace, and those conditions ultimately took the life of a worker. There is no excuse for an employer to compromise safety to keep production running,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health Dr. David Michaels. ""The Department of Labor has worked diligently with the Office of the United States Attorney for South Dakota to resolve this case and provide justice to the family of this worker. No one should ever lose their life for a job."" Because the willful violations cited by OSHA caused the worker's death, the case was referred to the U.S. Attorney for the District of South Dakota in November 2012 for criminal prosecution. Criminal Chief Dennis Holmes handled the case for the U.S. Attorney's Office. ""The purpose of this settlement, which was reached after discussions with the victim's family, is to provide justice to the family and deter similar corporate conduct in the future,"" said U.S. Attorney Brendan Johnson. ""The right of South Dakotans to a safe work environment isn't optional, it is fundamental. I commend OSHA for their investigative efforts, and I am pleased with the settlement that has been reached."" The agreement resolves both of the OSHA civil cases, and includes significant enhanced abatement of violations by the company. Adams Thermal Systems agreed to: increase the size of its safety and health department; implement a companywide safety and health program; provide incentives for managers and workers to report safety issues and make safety recommendations; and to hire a qualified third-party to review guarding and lockout/tagout for all plant machinery and to audit the abatement of all identified hazards. The company will also report quarterly to OSHA for three years on safety progress and reportable illnesses and injuries, and redesign the safety systems and procedures on the radiator core machine involved in the fatality.The agreement will resolve three willful citations issued for $210,000 on April 26, 2012, as a result of the fatality investigation. The settlement also resolves the additional citations issued on August 2012, following two concurrent comprehensive safety and health inspections, with proposed penalties of $225,000. The comprehensive safety and health cases involved 58 serious violations and eight other-than-serious violations addressing unlabeled piping systems; obstructions in aisles and passageways; unguarded machinery; crane and hoist hazards; improper exits; electrical hazards and exposures to chemicals, dust, and noise. OSHA placed Adams Thermal Systems, which manufactures engine cooling systems for off-highway and on-highway vehicles, in its Severe Violator Enforcement Program in August 2012 as a result of these inspections. The program mandates targeted follow-up inspections to ensure compliance with the law. The program focuses on recalcitrant employers that endanger workers by committing willful, repeat or failure-to-abate violations. To ask questions, obtain compliance assistance, file a complaint or report workplace hospitalizations, fatalities or situations posing imminent danger to workers, the public should call OSHA's toll-free hotline at 800-321-OSHA (6742). Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. OSHA's role is to ensure these conditions for America's working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education and assistance.For more information, visit http://www.osha.gov . # # # Adams Thermal Systems, Inc., Docket No. 12-1137, and Criminal Referral, Matter Number 05021236211 and Docket Nos. 12-1758 and 12-1759."

"August 29, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20130829,"WHD News Release: San Francisco Giants pay employees $545,000 in back wages, damages [08/29/2013]","US Labor Department finds clubhouse and administrative workers not paid properly SAN FRANCISCO — The San Francisco Giants baseball team paid $544,715 in back wages and liquidated damages to 74 employees after a U.S. Department of Labor investigation determined that the Major League Baseball club failed to properly pay the workers over a three-year period. As a result of the investigation, MLB and the department are now working to ensure that all teams are aware of and adhere to the requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act. Investigators with the department's Wage and Hour Division found violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act's minimum wage, overtime pay and record-keeping provisions. The violations affected a range of employees in the organization at the major and minor league levels, including clubhouse assistants and managers. San Francisco Baseball Associates LLC, the club's ownership group, has entered into an agreement with the department to ensure continued and future compliance with the FLSA. ""We are pleased that the Giants addressed this matter, and it is our hope that other Major League Baseball teams will take a close look at their pay practices to ensure they are in compliance with the law,"" said Laura Fortman, principal deputy administrator of the Wage and Hour Division. ""MLB has agreed to work collaboratively with the department to ensure all MLB teams are in compliance with the FLSA."" Susana Blanco, director of the San Francisco District Office of the Wage and Hour Division, said the case underscores the importance of wage protections: ""I am encouraged that the Giants acted to resolve this issue, but it was disappointing to learn that clubhouse workers providing services to high-paid sports stars weren't making enough to meet the basic requirements of minimum-wage law."" During the investigation, the department determined that clubhouse employees were working more hours than were recorded, under an employment agreement required by the club that established a flat rate of pay of $55 for working 5.5 hours per day. However, investigators found that the employees actually worked an average of 12 to 15 hours daily, and the workers received less than the hourly federal minimum wage of $7.25 and were also not paid overtime for hours exceeding 40 in a workweek. Investigators found the club had improperly classified a number of employees as exempt from overtime pay, including clubhouse managers at the major and minor league levels and video operators at the team's major and minor league affiliates. The non-exempt employees were paid a straight salary and no overtime premium, as required based on their job duties. Additionally, the investigation determined that the club failed to pay overtime or incorrectly calculated overtime pay for administrative staff participating in the Giants' bonus program, in violation of the FLSA. The FLSA requires that covered employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, as well as time and one-half their regular rates for hours worked over 40 per week. The law also requires employers to maintain accurate records of employees' wages, hours and other conditions of employment, and it prohibits employers from retaliating against employees who exercise their rights under the law. The FLSA provides that employers who violate the law are, as a general rule, liable to employees for back wages and an equal amount in liquidated damages. Liquidated damages are paid directly to the affected employees. For more information about the FLSA, call the Wage and Hour Division's toll-free helpline at 866-4US-WAGE (487-9243) or its San Francisco District Office at 415-625-7720.

"August 27, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ofccp/ofccp20131578,"OFCCP News Release: US Labor Department announces final rules to improve employment of veterans, people with disabilities [08/27/2013]","WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Labor today announced two final rules to improve hiring and employment of veterans and for people with disabilities. One rule updates requirements under the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974; the other updates those under Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. For more than 40 years these laws have required federal contractors and subcontractors to affirmatively recruit, hire, train and promote qualified veterans and people with disabilities respectively. ""In a competitive job market, employers need access to the best possible employees,"" said Secretary of Labor Thomas E. Perez. ""These rules make it easier for employers to tap into a large, diverse pool of qualified candidates."" ""Strengthening these regulations is an important step toward reducing barriers to real opportunities for veterans and individuals with disabilities,"" said Patricia A. Shiu, director of the department's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, which enforces both laws. The VEVRAA rule provides contractors with a quantifiable metric to measure their success in recruiting and employing veterans by requiring contractors to annually adopt a benchmark either based on the national percentage of veterans in the workforce (currently 8 percent), or their own benchmark based on the best available data. The rule strengthens accountability and record-keeping requirements, enabling contractors to assess the effectiveness of their recruitment efforts. It also clarifies job listing and subcontract requirements to facilitate compliance. The Section 503 rule introduces a hiring goal for federal contractors and subcontractors that 7 percent of each job group in their workforce be qualified individuals with disabilities. The rule also details specific actions contractors must take in the areas of recruitment, training, record keeping and policy dissemination — similar to those that have long been required to promote workplace equality for women and minorities. The rules will become effective 180 days after their publication in the Federal Register. More information is available at www.dol.gov/ofccp/VEVRAARule/ and www.dol.gov/ofccp/503Rule/ . OFCCP enforces Executive Order 11246, Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974. These three laws require those who do business with the federal government, both contractors and subcontractors, to follow the fair and reasonable standard that they not discriminate in employment on the basis of sex, race, color, religion, national origin, disability or status as a protected veteran.

"August 27, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20131782,MSHA News Release: MSHA announces results of July impact inspections [08/27/2013],"ARLINGTON, Va. — The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration today announced that federal inspectors issued 149 citations and 16 orders during special impact inspections conducted at nine coal mines and four metal/nonmetal mines last month. The monthly inspections, which began in force in April 2010 following the explosion at the Upper Big Branch Mine, involve mines that merit increased agency attention and enforcement due to their poor compliance history or particular compliance concerns. These matters include: high numbers of violations or closure orders; frequent hazard complaints or hotline calls; plan compliance issues; inadequate workplace examinations; a high number of accidents, injuries or illnesses; fatalities; adverse conditions, such as increased methane liberation, faulty roof conditions and inadequate ventilation; and respirable dust. One impact inspection conducted at Affinity Coal Company LLC's Affinity Mine in Raleigh County, W.Va., resulted in 13 citations, 10 unwarrantable failure orders and one imminent danger order. MSHA inspectors secured communications from the surface to prevent the possibility of advance notice. The imminent danger order was issued when a foreman was seen riding as a passenger in the bucket of a rubber-tired scoop in a wet, rough and uneven entry. Riding in the bucket violated a safeguard MSHA issued on Sept. 17, 2012. A miner riding in the bucket of a scoop can be thrown from the bucket and crushed. There have already been two fatalities involving scoops this year at the Affinity Mine. Five of the unwarrantable failure orders were issued for violations of the mine's ventilation plan. MSHA measured no ventilation on a section where two miners were operating a roof bolter, and only 150 cubic feet per minute of ventilation on another section where the ventilation plan required 7,800 cfm and the operator was actively mining coal. These conditions have the potential to result in methane and dust accumulations that may result in an explosion or fire, and expose miners to conditions that can lead to black lung. Other similar conditions of airflow significantly below the mine's ventilation plan requirements were found by MSHA inspectors. The operator also allowed excessive accumulations of combustible materials in the form of dry coal and coal dust ranging from 5 inches to 2 feet deep. Enforcement personnel identified 10 areas where the operator failed to apply rock dust along the mine roof and ribs for up to 80 feet, creating conditions that exposed miners to potential ignition and explosion hazards. The mine was cited for inadequate pre-shift examinations. In addition, one unwarrantable failure order was issued for a violation of the roof control plan where the operator did not install reflectors to signal the last row of roof supports. Warning signals are required to prevent miners from entering areas where the mine roof is not supported and could collapse on them. ""While many mine operators have improved working conditions at their mines, we continue to see unacceptable conditions at some mines that put lives at risk,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Mine Safety and Health Joseph A. Main. ""The type of conditions found by inspectors during this surprise inspection are the type that can expose miners to methane and coal dust explosions and black lung, and cannot be tolerated in the mining industry."" Since April 2010, MSHA has conducted 642 impact inspections and issued 10,789 citations, 996 orders and 45 safeguards.

Additionally, it was found that the Center sponsored a retirement plan, which currently has five participants and approximately $10,854.89 in assets, and had not taken fiduciary responsibility for the operation and administration of the plan and its assets, nor had it appointed anyone to assume said responsibility on an ongoing basis. The department filed a complaint on April 2, 2013, seeking the appointment of an independent fiduciary to terminate the plan and distribute its assets to the remaining plan participants.

"August 23, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20130823,OSHA News Release: US Department of Labors OSHA announces proposed rule to protect workers exposed to crystalline silica [08/23/2013],"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration today announced a proposed rule aimed at curbing lung cancer, silicosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and kidney disease in America's workers. The proposal seeks to lower worker exposure to crystalline silica, which kills hundreds of workers and sickens thousands more each year. After publication of the proposal, the public will have 90 days to submit written comments, followed by public hearings. ""Exposure to silica can be deadly, and limiting that exposure is essential,"" said Dr. David Michaels, assistant secretary of labor for occupational safety and health. ""Every year, exposed workers not only lose their ability to work, but also to breathe. This proposal is expected to prevent thousands of deaths from silicosis — an incurable and progressive disease — as well as lung cancer, other respiratory diseases and kidney disease. We're looking forward to public comment on the proposal."" Once the full effects of the rule are realized, OSHA estimates that the proposed rule would result in saving nearly 700 lives per year and prevent 1,600 new cases of silicosis annually. Exposure to airborne silica dust occurs in operations involving cutting, sawing, drilling and crushing of concrete, brick, block and other stone products and in operations using sand products, such as in glass manufacturing, foundries and sand blasting. The proposal is based on extensive review of scientific and technical evidence, consideration of current industry consensus standards and outreach by OSHA to stakeholders, including public stakeholder meetings, conferences and meetings with employer and employee organizations. ""The proposed rule uses common sense measures that will protect workers' lives and lungs — like keeping the material wet so dust doesn't become airborne,"" added Michaels. ""It is designed to give employers flexibility in selecting ways to meet the standard."" The proposed rulemaking includes two separate standards — one for general industry and maritime employment, and one for construction. The agency currently enforces 40-year-old permissible exposure limits (PELs) for crystalline silica in general industry, construction and shipyards that are outdated, inconsistent between industries and do not adequately protect worker health. The proposed rule brings protections into the 21st century. The proposed rule includes a new exposure limit for respirable crystalline silica and details widely used methods for controlling worker exposure, conducting medical surveillance, training workers about silica-related hazards and recordkeeping measures. OSHA rulemaking relies heavily on input from the public and the agency will conduct extensive engagement to garner feedback from the public through both written and oral comments. OSHA will accept public comments on the proposed rule for 90 days following publication in the Federal Register, followed by public hearings. Once public hearings conclude, members of the public who filed a notice of intention to appear can then submit additional post-hearing comments. Additional information on the proposed rule, including a video; procedures for submitting comments and the public hearings can be found at www.osha.gov/silica . Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. OSHA's role is to assure these conditions for America's working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education and assistance.

"August 22, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20131601,OSHA News Release: OSHA cites Hagel Metal Fabrication for willful violations after worker fatally crushed by unguarded machine at Illinois plant [08/22/2013],"Plant placed in Severe Violator Enforcement Program EAST PEORIA, Ill. — Hagel Metal Fabrication Inc., has been cited by the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration for 12 safety and health violations after a 23-year-old worker was fatally crushed Feb. 22 by an automated laser-cutting machine. During the investigation, workers made formal complaints, which prompted two additional OSHA inspections at the East Peoria metal manufacturing plant. ""The company failed to implement the most basic of safety precautions — and the result was a terrible tragedy. This case demonstrates an egregious disregard of worker safety and health,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health Dr. David Michaels. ""Employers have a responsibility to provide a safe workplace."" Three willful violations include: bypassing machine safeguards on two laser-cutting machines and the failures to lock out sources of hazardous machine energy. These safeguards were designed to prevent employees from being in areas of the machine where they could be struck and crushed by moving parts. Two additional serious violations include unguarded open-sided floors and platforms causing a fall hazard. A willful violation is one committed with intentional, knowing or voluntary disregard for the law's requirement, or plain indifference to employee safety and health. ""This tragedy could have been prevented if the company ensured adequate machine guarding, effective lockout-tagout procedures and worker training on hazards,"" said Tom Bielema, OSHA's area director in Peoria. ""The company willfully violated OSHA's Machine Guarding Standard, compromising worker safety and well-being."" After the incident, OSHA found other employees exposed to amputation hazards while operating a power press brake because the guard had not been set up properly. OSHA issued a willful violation for this hazard. Six serious citations were also issued for failing to: inspect powered industrial trucks before service and to remove them if they are damaged, mark the load capacity of lifting devices, provide training on hazardous energy control procedures and implement an effective lockout/tagout program to protect workers during machine servicing. OSHA also cited the company for work areas with potentially hazardous accumulations of powder coating dusts and for failing to implement an effective respiratory protection program with worksite-specific procedures. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known. OSHA proposed penalties totaling $317,000. The current citations may be viewed at http://www.osha.gov/ooc/citations/Hagel_Metal_891580_0821_13.pdf http://www.osha.gov/ooc/citations/Hagel_Metal_894717_0821_13.pdf http://www.osha.gov/ooc/citations/Hagel_Metal_894714_0821_13.pdf Because of the hazards and the violations cited, Hagel Metal Fabrication has been placed in OSHA's Severe Violator Enforcement Program, which mandates targeted follow-up inspections to ensure compliance with the law. OSHA's SVEP focuses on recalcitrant employers that endanger workers by committing willful, repeat or failure-to-abate violations. Under the program, OSHA may inspect any of the employer's facilities if it has reasonable grounds to believe there are similar violations. Hagel Metal Fabrication has been inspected by OSHA on seven previous occasions since 1989, resulting in the issuance of 23 citations including willful and serious citations for exposing workers to amputation injuries and machine guarding hazards. There are approximately 90 workers at the company. The company has 15 business days from receipt of its citations and penalties to comply, request an informal conference with OSHA's area director or contest the findings before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. To ask questions, obtain compliance assistance, file a complaint or report workplace hospitalizations, fatalities or situations posing imminent danger to workers, the public should call OSHA's toll-free hotline at 800-321-OSHA (6742) or the agency's Peoria Area Office at 309-589-7033. Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. OSHA's role is to ensure these conditions for America's working men and women by setting and enforcing standards and providing training, education and assistance.

"August 22, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20131768,OPA News Release: Statement by Secretary of Labor Thomas E. Perez on fatal occupational injuries in 2012 [08/22/2013],"WASHINGTON — Preliminary results from the Bureau of Labor Statistics' National Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries released today show a reduction in the number of fatal work injuries in 2012 compared with 2011. Last year, 4,383 workers died from work-related injuries, down from a final count of 4,693 fatal work injuries in 2011. Based on preliminary counts, the rate of fatal workplace injuries in 2012 was 3.2 per 100,000 full-time equivalent workers, down from a rate of 3.5 per 100,000 in 2011. In response, Secretary of Labor Thomas E. Perez issued the following statement: ""Workers in this country have the right to return home safe and healthy at the end of a work day. Despite that right, poor safety conditions cause thousands of people each year to lose their lives at work. ""I am greatly encouraged by the reduction in workplace fatalities, even in a growing economy. It is a testament to the hard work of employers, unions, health and safety professionals and the Labor Department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration and Mine Safety and Health Administration. Through collaborative education and outreach efforts, and effective law enforcement, these numbers indicate that we are absolutely moving in the right direction. ""But to me these aren't just numbers and data — they are fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters, who will never come home again. ""We can and must do better. Job gains in oil and gas and construction have come with more fatalities, and that is unacceptable. That's why OSHA has undertaken a number of outreach and educational initiatives, including a campaign to prevent falls in construction and the National Voluntary Stand Down of U.S. Onshore Oil and Gas Exploration and Production, co-sponsored by oil and gas industry employers and planned for Nov. 14. Employers must take job hazards seriously and live up to their legal and moral obligation to send their workers home safe every single day. The Labor Department is committed to preventing these needless deaths, and we will continue to engage with employers to make sure that these fatality numbers go down further. ""No worker should lose their life for a paycheck."""
"August 22, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20130822-0,US Department of Labor sues San Francisco's California Pacific Bank,"SAN FRANCISCO — The U.S. Department of Labor has filed a lawsuit against San Francisco's California Pacific Bank and four of its directors. The complaint alleges that the bank, its CEO and three additional fiduciaries of the bank's Employee Stock Ownership Plan mismanaged plan assets resulting in potential plan losses totaling approximately $1.4 million. The suit asks the court to require the fiduciaries to restore all losses they caused to the plan. The department alleges that after terminating the ESOP in 2010, the fiduciaries violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act by failing to liquidate and distribute plan assets in cash to plan participants as required. Because the bank is not a publicly traded company, participants were left with shares of the company's stock they could not easily liquidate for cash, if at all. Agency investigators determined that the participants would have received approximately $1.24 million if the plan's 97,237 shares had been liquidated and distributed in cash at their assessed December 2009 value. The lawsuit also alleges that in 2011, $81,407 was improperly diverted to the bank, and in 2012, the fiduciaries improperly transferred nearly $70,000 in plan assets to the bank. Finally it is alleged that the bank also held plan assets in non-interest bearing accounts, making assets available for bank use without charge and without accruing interest on the funds for the benefit of the plan. The complaint names California Pacific Bank CEO and board member Richard Chi, who served as the plan administrator and a plan trustee. Also named are board members and trustees Akila Chen, Kent Chen, and William Mo. The suit asks the court to permanently remove all four as plan fiduciaries and to appoint an independent fiduciary with control over the plan and its assets. The independent fiduciary would administer the liquidation and termination of the plan. The complaint also seeks to permanently enjoin the defendants from ever serving, directly or indirectly, as a fiduciary or service provider with respect to any employee benefit plan subject to ERISA, and to require them to disgorge to the plan any financial benefits they realized as a result of their violations. The department's Office of the Solicitor is litigating this case.

""These workers have specialized job skills needed in the nuclear power industry, and this federal funding will provide a range of re-employment services and opportunities,"" said acting Assistant Secretary of Labor for Employment and Training Eric Seleznow. The grant was awarded to the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development and will be administered by the Bay Area Workforce Development Board Inc. Under the grant, affected workers and eligible displaced homemakers will have access to services, including career and skill assessments, job search assistance, support services and training. In March 2013, the workers at Kewaunee Power Station were provided a notice under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act indicating about 632 workers would be affected by the closure of the power plant. While the plant ceased operation on May 7, 2013, decommission of the plant and restoration of the property will take several decades. National Emergency Grants are part of the secretary of labor's discretionary fund and are awarded based on a state's ability to meet specific guidelines.

A subsequent investigation by the department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration found that from 2007 through 2009, 800 West Salon Inc. in Marlton, N.J., and its principal Raymond Orsuto failed to ensure employee contributions and loan repayments approximating $38,080.94 were remitted to the plan. Additionally, of those employee contributions that were remitted, some were remitted up to 145 days after they were deducted from the participants’ compensation, causing lost earnings to be due to the plan. As a result, on Aug. 16, 2013, the department filed suit seeking restoration of unremitted employee contributions and interest costs to the plan. As additional relief, the department is also seeking to enjoin Orsuto and the company from serving as fiduciaries or service providers to any Employee Retirement Income Security Act covered plan and from violating provisions of Title I of ERISA, and the appointment of an independent fiduciary to administer the plan, marshal assets and make distributions to plan participants. Finally, the complaint seeks an order that Orsuto and the company provide all books, documents and records relating to the financial administration of the plan and company.

"August 14, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20131685,MSHA News Release: MSHA launches new online tool to assist mine operators [08/14/2013],"ARLINGTON, Va. — The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration today launched a new online tool for the mining industry. The S&S Rate Calculator enables mine operators who implement a corrective action program to determine if their mine is successfully reducing its significant and substantial, or S&S, violations. S&S violations are violations of a mandatory health or safety standard that ""significantly and substantially contributes to the cause and effect of a coal or other mine safety or health hazard."" The S&S Rate Calculator is an enhancement to the two-year-old Pattern of Violations Monitoring Tool, which allows mine operators, miners and stakeholders to measure a mine's performance against MSHA's specific screening criteria for violations. The S&S Rate Calculator allows users to determine a mine's rate of S&S violations for any specific date range. Users need only the mine's 7-digit ID number to find data. ""It is the mine operator's responsibility to track its violation and injury histories to determine whether it needs to take action to comply with mine safety laws, protect miners and not trigger a POV notice,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""Operators who implement a corrective action program can use this tool, which complements the POV monitoring tool, to track their progress and make sure a corrective action program is effectively addressing the mine's S&S rate."" MSHA published a final rule in January revising the POV regulation. The rule provides mine operators who may be approaching POV status the opportunity to implement a corrective action program, and MSHA may consider a mine operator's effective implementation of an MSHA-approved corrective action program as a mitigating circumstance in its POV review. For mines in POV status, each S&S violation will result in a withdrawal order until a complete inspection finds no S&S violations. The S&S rate calculator is available at: http://www.msha.gov/DRS/SNSRateCalculator.asp"

"August 13, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20131608,OSHA News Release: Republic Steel faces fines of $1.1 million for 24 safety violations;company previously agreed to address hazards in 2012 OSHA settlement [08/13/2013],"CANTON, Ohio — Republic Steel has been cited by the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration for 24 safety violations carrying fines of $1,138,500. Fifteen willful violations of OSHA's fall protection standards were found at the company's Canton steel manufacturing plant. OSHA received a formal complaint from the United Steelworkers Union alleging inadequate fall protection and other unsafe practices exposing workers to various hazards in the plant's melt shop. During the inspection, opened in February 2013, OSHA discovered that two workers had been seriously injured in falls at the site in June and August of 2012. ""People working hard to provide for their families should not have worry each day whether they'll come home,"" said Secretary of Labor Thomas E. Perez. ""Republic Steel put their workers' lives in danger, and that kind of disregard for safety will not be tolerated."" The company has a history of failing to address fall hazards. In 2011, after an employee was seriously injured in a fall at the company's Lorain, Ohio, facility, OSHA issued willful citations to the company for fall hazards. In a settlement with OSHA in 2012, the company accepted three willful fall hazard violations at the Lorain plant and agreed to address fall protection at its plants, including the Canton plant. ""Republic Steel has a long history of OSHA violations and disregard for employee safety and health,"" said Dr. David Michaels, assistant secretary of labor for occupational safety and health. ""It is unacceptable that Republic Steel has not taken more effective steps to improve safety at the Canton plant, particularly in light of a 2012 settlement aimed at exactly that. OSHA will remain diligent in its commitment to protect America's steel workers."" A total of 15 willful violations were cited for failing to provide fall protection in the Canton steel mill. Among the violations noted were lack of fall protection while working on the runway girders that were 66 feet above the ground and falls of 30 feet due to missing and damaged guardrails. Workers were also exposed to falls of up to 30 feet above the slag pit and falls of 20 feet above the electric arc furnace and molten steel ladle. A willful violation is one committed with intentional, knowing or voluntary disregard for the law's requirements, or plain indifference to employee safety and health. One repeat violation was cited for failing to post danger signs or other effective means of indicating the existence and location of permit-required confined spaces in the melt shop. OSHA issues repeat violations if an employer previously was cited for the same or a similar violation of any standard, regulation, rule or order at any other facility in federal enforcement states within the last five years. The same violation was cited in August 2009 at the company's facility in Blasdell, N.Y. Additionally, eight serious violations include tripping hazards, the use of electrical panels not suitable for wet locations, lack of personal protective equipment for employees working around the furnace, failing to evaluate potential hazards in confined spaces that employees might need to enter such as furnaces and duct work, and failure to train workers on hazards and issue entry permits for those spaces. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known. The current citations may be viewed at http://www.osha.gov/ooc/citations/Republic_Steel_891561_0812_13.PDF. Republic Steel will remain in OSHA's Severe Violator Enforcement Program, which mandates targeted follow-up inspections to ensure compliance with the law. The company was placed in the program in 2011. OSHA's severe violator program focuses on recalcitrant employers that endanger workers by committing willful, repeat or failure-to-abate violations. Under the program, OSHA may inspect any of the employer's facilities if it has reasonable grounds to believe there are similar violations. The company, which is headquartered in Canton, employs approximately 2,500 workers companywide and 600 at the Canton mill. Other Republic Steel mills are located in Massillon and Lorain, Ohio, and Blasdell, N.Y. The Canton plant has been inspected by OSHA 16 times, which resulted in one willful, two repeat, 22 serious and 23 other-than-serious final order citations. As a corporate entity, Republic Steel has been inspected 79 times resulting in the issuance of six willful, 15 repeat, 145 serious and 70 other-than-serious final order citations. The company has 15 business days from receipt of the citations and notice of proposed penalties to contest the citations and proposed penalties before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. If the company does not file or contest within that period, it must abate the cited conditions within the period ordered in the citations and pay the proposed penalties. To ask questions, obtain compliance assistance, file a complaint, or report workplace hospitalizations, fatalities or situations posing imminent danger to workers, the public should call OSHA's toll-free hotline at 800-321-OSHA (6742) or the agency's Cleveland Area Office at 216-615-4266. Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. OSHA's role is to ensure these conditions for America's working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education and assistance.

"August 13, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20131649,MSHA News Release: MSHA clarifies that OSHA's hazard communication standardmeets requirements of MSHA's HazCom standard [08/13/2013],"ARLINGTON , Va. — The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration today issued guidance to the mining industry to clarify that mine operators who meet the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's hazard communication standard will be in compliance with MSHA's hazard communication standard. The guidance, in a program policy letter, reflects MSHA's understanding that many mine operators are meeting OSHA's HazCom standard. OSHA recently published an update to its Hazard Communication Standard, incorporating the United Nations' Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals. Major changes to OSHA's HazCom standard include a new system of classifying types and degrees of hazards, changes to labeling requirements and changes to the Safety Data Sheet, formerly called the Material Safety Data Sheet. ""MSHA policy being issued today clarifies that compliance with OSHA's HazCom rule meets the requirements of MSHA's HazCom rule,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""We recognize that many mines already receive safety data sheets and labels for hazardous chemicals that are developed in accordance with OSHA's revised standard. We also recognize that mine operators may be required to develop safety data sheets and labels compliant with OSHA's standard in order to transport, import or export hazardous chemicals because of the transition to the global classification and labeling system. ""This compatibility is a win-win: it reduces the burden of maintaining two separate systems for identifying hazardous chemicals and communication of hazards while providing at least the same protections to miners as MSHA's existing HazCom standard. A single system will also promote consistency with other industries and federal agencies with respect to identification and communication of hazards,"" said Main. Title 30, Part 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations requires mine operators to develop, implement, and maintain a written HazCom program. Operators must identify chemicals, make a hazard determination, ensure that containers of hazardous chemicals have labels, have and make available a data sheet for each hazardous chemical used or produced at the mine; and instruct miners on the physical and health hazards of the chemicals in the miners' work area, protective measures, and contents of the HazCom program. While OSHA's HazCom standard is compatible with MSHA's, some aspects of OSHA's hazard classification may not be compatible with other existing MSHA standards, such as storage requirements for hazardous chemicals. Mine operators must comply with all existing MSHA standards concerning hazardous chemicals. Under MSHA's HazCom standard, operators are required to train miners on the contents of the mine's HazCom program. Operators must describe in their written HazCom programs the HazCom practices in place at the mine, including practices for hazard determination, labels, and safety data sheets. For this reason, if operators choose to incorporate OSHA's updated HazCom rule, they also must update their written HazCom programs and conduct miner training on the new system.

The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana, alleges that between December 2008 and March 2009, Walker and the company failed to remit employee contributions to the GSSP Short-Term Disability Plan, GSSP Long-Term Disability Plan and GSSP Dental and Vision Plan. The defendants also failed to properly administer the plans by using plan assets to benefit themselves. “Plan officials have a duty to manage and protect employees’ benefit plans and their assets,” said Deborah Perry, regional director of the department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration in Dallas, which investigated the case. “Through this action, we intend to restore plan assets to the workers that earned them.” The department’s lawsuit seeks a court order to restore all losses, with interest, to the plans, and seeks the appointment of an independent fiduciary to administer disbursements.

Allegations: The defendants breached their fiduciary duties and engaged in prohibited transactions when they placed 13 employee benefit plans into Global Money Management (GMM), a hedge fund which collapsed and went bankrupt. The complaint alleged that Zenith Capital and the individual defendants placed the plans in the high-risk hedge fund despite the fact that the plans were not qualified, accredited investors, and failed to conduct prudent due diligence on GMM or its suitability as an investment for the plans. They also failed to disclose GMM’s ownership interest in Zenith Capital and their receipt of incentive fees from GMM for the plans that it placed into GMM. The general partners of GMM were convicted of mail and wire fraud in connection with GMM. Resolution: The department obtained approval of four consent judgments by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, resolving its allegations against the defendants. Zenith Capital was ordered to pay $602,018 in restitution for plan losses and restoration of the improper incentive fees, plus lost opportunity costs and penalties payable to the department. The three individual defendants were ordered to restore $503,385 in plan losses, incentive fees and penalties. In addition, Tasker, Smith and Cooper are permanently barred from serving or acting as discretionary fiduciaries, investment managers, or trustees or administrators to an ERISA-covered plan. The consent orders require the defendants to meet certain disclosure and training requirements in order to serve as consultants or investment advisors to ERISA-covered plans.

"August 7, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20130807,"WHD News Release: US Labor Department finds violations of federal job-protected leave, back wages for worker at T.G.I. Fridays [08/07/2013]","WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division announced today that T.G.I .Fridays, a subsidiary of Minnesota-based Carlson, has agreed to change its leave policy to be in compliance with the Family and Medical Leave Act. The move affects employees at its 272 company-owned locations. The company has also agreed to correct violations of the FMLA found during an investigation of one of its restaurants in Shreveport, La., and pay an employee $1,455 in back wages. ""Workers should not have to choose between their job, and the family members who need their care,"" said Laura Fortman, principal deputy administrator for the Wage and Hour Division. ""Ensuring a work-life balance is the cornerstone of the Family and Medical Leave Act, which has been the law of the land for 20 years. It gives America's workers the right to take unpaid, job-protected leave to care for themselves or a loved one. As we move into its third decade, we are more dedicated than ever to enforcing the law when necessary to protect workers, yet continue to offer assistance to those employers who need help to come into compliance."" The agency's investigation found that the company violated the FMLA by failing to reinstate the employee to the same or equivalent position, including pay, benefits and other terms of employment, and that the worker was not allowed to return to work immediately following FMLA-covered leave. The delay in allowing the employee to return to work caused the employee to lose three weeks of pay. Additionally, the investigation found that the company's FMLA policy and worker rights notification practices were not in keeping with the law. Specifically, the policy did not include information on the FMLA's military family leave provisions, information on the right to take FMLA-covered leave on an intermittent or reduced schedule basis, and misstated the 12-month employment requirement for FMLA eligibility as being 12 continuous months. The FMLA entitles eligible employees of covered employers to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave in a 12-month period for specified family and medical reasons with continuation of group health insurance coverage under the same terms and conditions as if the employee had not taken leave. Under certain circumstances, military family leave entitlements allow eligible employees up to 26 weeks of leave. Employers are prohibited from interfering with, restraining or denying the exercise of (or the attempt to exercise) any FMLA right. Employers also are prohibited from discriminating or retaliating against an employee or prospective employee for having exercised or attempted to exercise any FMLA right. For example, an employer may not use an employee's request for or use of FMLA leave as a negative factor in employment actions such as hiring, promotions or disciplinary procedures. For more information about the FMLA and other federal wage laws, call the Wage and Hour Division's toll-free helpline at 866-4US-WAGE (487-9243) or the division's New Orleans District Office at 504-589-6171.

The settlement, which resolves two enforcement cases that began in 2011, includes provisions for the Bentonville, Ark.-based retailer to enhance safety and health practices and training related to trash compactors, cleaning chemicals and hazard communications corporate-wide. ""This settlement will help to keep thousands of exposed Wal-Mart workers safe and healthy on the job,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health Dr. David Michaels. ""We hope this sends a strong message that the law requires employers to provide safe working conditions, and OSHA will use all the tools at our disposal to ensure that all employers follow the law."" Under the settlement, trash compactors must remain locked while not in use, and may not be operated except under the supervision of a trained manager or other trained, designated monitor. Wal-Mart will also improve its hazard communications training; and, for cleaning chemicals, will enhance its procedures to ensure that employees do not handle undiluted chemicals. Also, the company must ensure that a protective protocol is in place in case of any malfunctions with a store's cleaning chemicals dispensing equipment. Wal-Mart will ensure employees are trained on the new procedures in a language, format, and vocabulary that the workers can understand. For the safety citations pertinent to the corporate-wide trash compactor abatement, the settlement affirms one repeat lockout/tagout citation, two serious lockout/tagout citations, two serious confined space citations, and one serious machine guarding citation. For the health citations pertinent to the corporate-wide cleaning chemical and hazard communication abatement, the settlement affirms two serious citations related to personal protective equipment, and two serious hazard communication citations. A summary of the agreement will be posted in each affected store. Settlement negotiations followed issuance of citations from two separate inspections conducted at the Wal-Mart Supercenter store in Rochester, N.Y. A safety inspection was initiated on Aug. 2, 2011, and a health inspection began Aug. 17, 2011. As part of the settlement, Wal-Mart has also agreed to abate other hazards in the Rochester store unrelated to the corporate-wide remedy, and will pay $190,000 in civil penalties. For the citations not related to the corporate-wide abatement, citations affirmed in the settlement include one repeat electrical hazard citation, one serious citation for obstructed exit routes, two serious machine guarding citations, one repeat other-than-serious platform fall hazard citation, and 11 serious bloodborne pathogens citations. The settlement agreement can be viewed at http://www.osha.gov/CWSA/walmart2013.html . Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. OSHA's role is to ensure these conditions for America's working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education and assistance.

In the first, MSHA is requesting data, comments and information on issues and options relevant to miners' escape and refuge during underground coal mine emergencies. MSHA also announced a limited reopening of the record of the refuge alternative final rule published on Dec. 31, 2008. The 60-day comment period for both closes on Oct. 7. ""Responses to the broad Request for Information will assist MSHA in determining if changes to existing practices and regulations would improve the overall strategy for survivability, escape and training to protect miners in an emergency,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""MSHA will review the comments to determine what further actions, if any, the agency will take."" Additionally, on Oct. 26, 2010, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a decision on the refuge alternative rule, holding that the secretary of labor had not adequately explained the basis for requiring motor task (hands-on), decision-making, and expectations training only annually, rather than quarterly. The court remanded the training provision and ordered MSHA to either ""provide an explanation... or... reopen the record, and afford interested parties an opportunity to comment."" [United Mine Workers v. MSHA, 626 F.3d 84, 86, and 90-94 (D.C. Cir. 2010)] Section 13 of the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006 directed the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health to conduct research and tests concerning the use of refuge chambers in underground coal mines, and to report the results to Congress and the secretary of labor. In its report, NIOSH concluded that refuge alternatives have the potential for saving lives of miners if they are part of a comprehensive escape and rescue plan, and if appropriate training is provided. There are two types of refuge alternatives: in-place shelters and mobile chambers. Since the refuge alternatives rule became effective on March 2, 2009, refuge alternatives have been placed in underground coal mines across the country. ""Over the past five years, the mining community — operators and miners — has gained a great deal of experience with this technology and survival strategy,"" said Main. ""We welcome the opportunity to hear from them on improvements we can make to better protect miners during mine emergencies and enhance their training experiences."""

""As a result of efforts undertaken by MSHA and the mining community, we have seen a significant reduction in coal mine roof fall accidents, which have traditionally been a leading source of debilitating injuries and death for coal miners,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health Each year during its Preventive Roof/Rib Outreach Program (PROP), MSHA educates miners and mine operators about the dangers of roof and rib falls in underground coal mines. From 2003-2007, 28 miners lost their lives in accidents involving falls of the mine's roof and ribs. Over the next five years, from 2008 through 2012, the number of roof and rib fall fatalities dropped to 19, a 32 percent reduction. More significantly, the number of fatalities resulting from retreat mining fell from seven during the first five-year period to zero for the 2008-2012 period. Retreat mining is the practice of mining coal and leaving pillars standing to support the mine roof. When mining is completed in that area, miners carefully collapse and remove the pillars as the work then retreats from that section of the underground mine. ""Everyone in this industry — miners and their representatives, mine operators as well as MSHA personnel — have worked together to make mines safer and more secure from roof falls,"" said Main. ""However, while we have made real gains in eliminating fatalities from retreat mining, we must redouble our efforts to address hazards in other areas of underground roof and rib safety."" In 2012, 377 miners were injured from roof and rib falls. Of these, 145 were roof-bolter operators injured from roof falls, and another 20 were roof-bolter operators injured from falls of rib. With this in mind, MSHA's 2013 PROP effort will focus on Roof Bolter Operator Safety. Through the release of a four-part series of informational posters, the agency will target roof-bolter roof and rib fall injuries, as well as other accidents from hands-on drilling, pinch points and accidental control activation."

The private sector added 161,000 new jobs in July, marking the 41st straight month of private-sector job growth and a total of 7.3 million new private-sector jobs added over that time period. ""This report is good news, and the economic turnaround over the past four years has been unmistakable. More Americans are finding work, but we can and must do more to pick up the pace of this recovery. So President Obama has offered specific proposals that will jumpstart job growth and foster a growing economy powered by a rising, thriving middle class. The president wants to rebuild our infrastructure, invest in manufacturing innovation, create incentives for clean energy and increase U.S. exports. He has also proposed strengthening our community colleges, linking them more directly to the business community, so that workers have the skills and training to succeed in new jobs. ""Congress should join the president in a ‘common-sense caucus' so that government contributes to a growing economy. For too long, Congress has been single-mindedly focused on an austerity agenda that has kept us in an economic straitjacket. It's time for a grand bargain for middle-class jobs. ""My job as secretary of labor is to safeguard and expand opportunity for everyone willing to work for it. I look forward to working with the president and Congress in the coming months and years toward that goal."""

"July 31, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20130731,"Plymouth Meeting, Pa., brokerage firm agrees to pay nearly $300,000 in disgorged profits to Deland, Fla., retirement plan","PLYMOUTH MEETING, Pa. – The U.S. Department of Labor has obtained a consent judgment ordering a Plymouth Meeting insurance brokerage firm and its chief executive officer to return $272,722 to plan participants and beneficiaries. The department alleges that Dietrich & Associates Inc., and CEO and sole shareholder Kurt E. Dietrich, obtained the money inappropriately when they provided services to an Employee Retirement Income Security Act-covered retirement plan sponsored by Memorial Hospital-West Volusia Inc. in Deland, Fla. The judgment resolves a lawsuit filed by the department following an investigation by the Employee Benefits Security Administration that found ERISA violations. “The department was prepared to prove that the defendants took advantage of their position with the plan to earn undisclosed payments from the plan’s insurance company,” said Marc Machiz, EBSA’s regional director in Philadelphia. “We are pleased with the consensual resolution of the litigation, which sends a clear message that plan fiduciaries will be held accountable when they don’t act in the best interest of the plan and its participants.” Under the terms of the consent order, in addition to paying the disgorgement and a $27,273 penalty, the defendants must enter into written agreements, which disclose all information required by the law with any ERISA plans they service in the future. The consent judgment also requires the defendants to ensure that any entities they control in the future comply with the requirements of the consent order. The department filed the lawsuit in September 2012 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, alleging the defendants violated ERISA when the retirement plan contracted Dietrich & Associates to act as its fiduciary and obtain bids from insurance companies for a termination annuity for a fee of $50,000. It also alleges that the company failed to disclose to plan fiduciaries a pre-existing arrangement with Hartford Life Insurance Co., the insurance company that won the bid, which entitled Dietrich & Associates to receive additional undisclosed compensation. The case was litigated by the department’s Office of the Solicitor in Washington, D.C. EBSA protects the retirement, health and other workplace-related benefits of America’s workers, retirees and their families. The agency oversees approximately 701,000 private sector retirement plans, 2.3 million health plans and other plans that provide benefits to more than 141 million Americans. Collectively, these plans hold more than $7.3 trillion in assets. Additional information can be found at www.dol.gov/ebsa. Perez v. Dietrich & Associates Inc. et al.

""The use of 1-bromopropane has increased in workplaces over the last 20 years,"" said Dr. David Michaels, assistant secretary of labor for occupational safety and health. ""Workers exposed to this toxic chemical can suffer serious health effects, even long after exposure has ended. Hazardous exposure to 1-BP must be prevented. Employers have a responsibility to ensure the safety of their workers."" Exposure to 1-BP has been associated with damage to the nervous system among workers, and it has been shown to cause reproductive harm in animal studies. The chemical is used in degreasing operations, furniture manufacturing, and dry cleaning. The hazard alert was issued in response to information on the increased use of 1-BP as a substitute for other solvents as well as recent reports of overexposure in furniture manufacturing. 1-BP was nominated as a chemical of concern in OSHA's Web Forum to Identify Hazardous Chemicals. Workers can be exposed to 1-BP by breathing in vapors or spray mists and by absorption through the skin. The most effective way to protect workers from exposure is to eliminate the use of 1-BP, substituting the chemical with a less toxic substance or less hazardous material. Replacement chemicals also may have associated hazards that need to be considered and controlled. Engineering controls to reduce worker exposure to 1-BP include isolation of workplace operations and the installation of proper ventilation systems. Other controls, such as a reduction in the time a worker is exposed to the chemical, should also be considered. The hazard alert can be viewed at: https://www.osha.gov/Publications/OSHA_3676.pdf Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. OSHA's role is to ensure these conditions for America's working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education and assistance.

"July 31, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20131568,"OPA News Release: Perez: Senate workforce investment bill will create opportunity, strengthen middle class [07/31/2013]","WASHINGTON — Secretary of Labor Tom Perez today issued the following statement regarding Senate committee markup of the Workforce Investment Act of 2013: ""To create opportunity for the American people and ensure a better bargain for the middle class, we need strong partnerships to build a world-class workforce. ""By collaborating with business leaders, labor, workforce boards, community colleges, nonprofits and others, we can build a workforce system that ensures workers have the skills they need to succeed and employers have the workforce they need to compete in the 21st century. ""We applaud the U.S. Senate for taking a major step in that direction with the bipartisan approval by the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions of S. 1356, the Workforce Investment Act of 2013. I particularly want to thank Chairman Harkin, Ranking Member Alexander, Senator Murray and Senator Isakson for their efforts. This step to modernize the Act is long overdue — it was 15 years ago this summer that the Workforce Investment Act first became law. ""We need a demand-driven approach to workforce development, one that responds to the needs of employers and prepares people for the jobs that are actually available. We need to align the workforce system with regional economies and establish a more integrated network of American Job Centers. We need to promote innovation and strengthen performance evaluation in the system, so consumers can get information about programs and services that work and taxpayers know we are spending their dollars wisely. ""S. 1356 meets these tests, building on the strength of the current law at the same time that it updates and streamlines the system. It is a significant improvement over the partisan legislation passed by the House in March. The House bill froze funding and failed to provide many of the services needed by workers with the greatest barriers to employment, including veterans, disadvantaged youth and people with disabilities. ""We hope that S. 1356 will move quickly to the Senate floor, with Congress sending a sound, bipartisan bill to the White House for the president's signature. Reauthorizing the Workforce Investment Act will grow our economy, help restore middle-class security and empower more people to live the American Dream."""
"July 31, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20131548,MSHA News Release: US Labor Department's MSHA releases mid-year mine fatality update [07/31/2013],"ARLINGTON, Va. — The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration today released a mid-year summary of mining deaths across the country. During the first half of 2013, 18 miners died in work-related accidents at the nation's mines, one less than in the first half of 2012. Nine each were killed in coal mining and metal and nonmetal mining accidents. Six coal miners died in less than 30 days — four of them in West Virginia — which led to increased actions by MSHA. In both coal and metal and nonmetal mining, one of the miners killed was a contractor. Among the nine coal mining deaths, two miners died in machinery accidents, three in powered haulage accidents, and two in roof fall accidents. One miner died in an accident resulting from exploding vessels under pressure when he was struck by a hydraulic cylinder on a filter press, and one was killed in a hoisting accident. In metal and nonmetal mining, one miner died in a fall of highwall, one was killed in a machinery accident, and one miner died in an accident involving explosives and breaking agents. Four miners were killed in powered haulage accidents and two miners in falling material accidents. ""The one recurring element in the fatalities we've seen this year is that they were preventable. The final numbers released by MSHA earlier this month showed that 2012 had the lowest mining death and injury rates in the history of U.S. mining,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""Many mines operate every shift of every day, year in and year out, without a fatality or a lost-time injury. Mining workplaces can and must be made safe for all miners."" According to MSHA, fatalities can be prevented by using effective safety and health management programs in the workplace. Workplace examinations for hazards — pre-shift and on-shift every shift — can identify and eliminate hazards that kill and injure miners. Effective and appropriate training better positions miners to recognize and understand hazards and find ways to control or eliminate them. Furthermore, miners must be free to exercise their rights under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 and be full participants in maintaining a safe and healthful workplace. To review MSHA's analysis of mining fatalities that occurred during the first half of 2013, along with best practices to help mining operations avoid similar fatalities, go to the agency's website at http://www.msha.gov/fatals/summaries/summaries.asp .

The memorandum was signed by Secretary of Labor Tom Perez and SEC Chair Mary Jo White. ""The department views our work with the SEC on shared interests in recent years as a tremendous success. By renewing this memorandum of understanding, we will continue to better serve all of America's workers who depend on private-sector retirement plans,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Employee Benefits Security Phyllis C. Borzi. ""Our experience with the SEC helps to boost the department's enforcement program and ensure that our regulatory and other programs work in tandem with the SEC's initiatives to provide meaningful protections for workers' retirement savings."" The memorandum sets forth a process for the department's Employee Benefits Security Administration and SEC staffs to share information and meet regularly to discuss topics of mutual interest. The memorandum also will facilitate the sharing of non-public information regarding subjects of mutual interest between the two agencies. Additionally, both agencies will cross-train staff with the goal of enhancing each agency's understanding of the other's mission and investigative jurisdiction. As more and more investors turn to the markets to help secure their futures, pay for homes and send children to college, the shared investor protection mission of the SEC and the Department of Labor is more vital for America's workers than ever before. The renewed memorandum reinforces the agencies' historical commitment to share information and work together on a variety of regulatory, enforcement, public outreach, research and information technology matters. EBSA's mission is to assure the retirement, health and other workplace-related benefits of America's workers, retirees and their families. In the retirement area, EBSA has authority over private-sector retirement plans including 401(k) plans and IRAs, plan fiduciaries, and service providers.

"July 31, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20131516,"EBSA News Release: US Labor Department obtains preliminary injunction against Kentucky-based plan fiduciaries, alleging improper use of retirement funds [07/31/2013]","LEXINGTON, Ky. — The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky on July 26 granted in part the U.S. Department of Labor's motion for a preliminary injunction against George S. Hofmeister and Bernard Tew, former fiduciaries of four Lexington-based pension plans: the Hillsdale Salaried, Hillsdale Hourly, Revstone Casting Fairfield GMP Local 359, and Fourslides Inc. The department previously filed lawsuits in the same court that named Hofmeister and Tew, among others. Hofmeister was the trustee of the four pension plans, and Tew was managing director of their investment service provider, Bluegrass Investment Management LLC. The court's order removes Hofmeister as a fiduciary of the plans and prohibits him from taking any actions with respect to the pensions plans or their assets. Tew resigned as fiduciary of the plans a few days before a hearing regarding the department's motion. The lawsuits alleged that the defendants engaged in a series of prohibited transactions resulting in the misuse of approximately $12.1 million from the Hillsdale Salaried pension plan, approximately $22.5 million from the Hillsdale Hourly pension plan, approximately $4.4 million from the Revstone Casting Fairfield GMP Local 359 pension plan, and approximately $500,000 from the Fourslides Inc. pension plan. The four plan sponsors are closely affiliated with Lexington-based Revstone Industries LLC and Spara LLC. ""Those entrusted with managing these pension funds have shown an utter disregard for the workers, who are relying on the money for their retirement,"" said Phyllis C. Borzi, the assistant secretary of labor who heads the Employee Benefits Security Administration. ""Our aim is to make this right for those workers."" The suits follow an EBSA investigation that found violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, including prohibited loans to related companies, prohibited use of plan assets for the purchase and lease of employer property, prohibited purchase of customer notes from affiliated companies, prohibited transfer of assets in favor of parties-in-interest, payment of excessive fees to services providers, and payment of fees on behalf of the companies. According to the brief filed on behalf of the department by the Cleveland Regional Solicitor's Office, Hofmeister, Tew and Bluegrass have repeatedly violated ERISA, using nearly $40 million in pension plan assets to benefit themselves or related parties. The department's investigation of these pension plans revealed a pattern of prohibited transactions involving the use of these plans' assets by Hofmeister, Tew and investment adviser firms. Alleged improper use of the plans' assets began within days or months of Hofmeister assuming control of the pension plans. The department contends that Hofmeister has placed millions of dollars in pension plan assets at risk and has consistently failed to act to protect these assets when required. The court has appointed Fiduciary Counselors Inc. to administer the four pension plans. Fiduciary Counselors is an investment adviser firm in Washington, D.C., that has extensive experience acting as an independent fiduciary for employee benefit plans. These cases were investigated by EBSA's Cincinnati Regional Office. They are being litigated by the department's Cleveland Regional Solicitor's Office. Employers and workers can contact EBSA's Cincinnati office at 859-578-4680 or toll-free at 866-444-3272 for help with problems relating to private sector retirement and health plans.

Additionally, from March 1, 2005, through Nov. 19, 2010, Hall caused Stainless Steel Fabricating to retain employee contributions in the company’s corporate account and failed to ensure they were deposited in the employees’ individual Salary Reduction Simplified Employee Pension Plan accounts. Furthermore, during the period of June 2009 though July 2009, Stainless Steel Fabricating allegedly withheld $1,313.54 from its employees’ pay and failed to remit the employee contributions to the Stainless Steel Fabricating, Inc. Health Plan. Resolution: The consent order and judgment requires Hall to restore to the Stainless Steel Fabricating, Inc., Salary Reduction Simplified Employee Pension Plan a total of $32,785.62 representing all losses, including lost opportunity costs, resulting from fiduciary breaches committed by him or for which he is liable. Hall has waived the 14,663.00 owed to his own account, and is responsible for restoring the remaining balance. Additionally, the consent order and judgment requires Hall to refund to the Health Plan participants the amount of $1,313.54, which Stainless Steel Fabricating withheld from their paychecks but did not remit to the Health Plan. The consent order also permanently enjoins Hall from violating the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and from serving as a fiduciary or service provider to any ERISA-covered plan.

"July 29, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ofccp/ofccp20131460,"OFCCP News Release: L&M Construction to pay nearly $113,000 to settle major sexual harassment case with US Labor Department [07/29/2013]","WASHINGTON, D.C. — The U.S. Department of Labor today announced that federal contractor L&M Construction has agreed to settle allegations that it permitted sexual harassment, retaliated against workers who complained about a hostile work environment, and interfered with a federal investigation. The conciliation agreement entered into by L&M and the department's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs resolves these and numerous other violations of law at the company's construction work sites across the Washington metropolitan area. In May 2012, OFCCP's Arlington Area Office scheduled L&M Construction for a compliance review. During a workers' outreach forum that month, department officials were alerted to complaints of sexual harassment that included inappropriate touching, lewd acts, sexual gestures, comments and propositions directed at female employees of L&M between May 1, 2011 and April 30, 2012. Upon further investigation, OFCCP compliance officers discovered that the company terminated nine employees for complaining about the hostile work environment created by this harassment and then fired five more workers to prevent them from being interviewed during OFCCP's review. The 14 terminated workers were seven Hispanic men and seven Hispanic women. ""No worker should ever have to put up with degrading and inappropriate behavior in order to keep a job,"" said OFCCP Director Patricia A. Shiu. ""I hope this settlement sends a clear message to federal contractors — and to the men and women who work for them — that OFCCP will not tolerate retaliation against workers who exercise their rights, nor will we tolerate any efforts to interfere with our investigations."" Under the terms of the conciliation agreement, L&M Construction will pay $112,573 in back wages to the 14 terminated workers and will make job offers as opportunities become available. The company has agreed to hire an outside party to evaluate and, if necessary, develop its equal employment opportunity and anti-harassment policies. The contractor has also agreed to undertake extensive self-monitoring measures and training to ensure that all of its employment practices fully comply with Executive Order 11246, which prohibits federal contractors and subcontractors from discriminating in employment decisions on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or national origin. Based in Capitol Heights, Md., L&M Construction provides environmental remediation and restoration services, including asbestos abatement and removal. The company has held more than $1.4 million in federal contracts with federal agencies including the U.S. Department of Commerce's National Institutes of Standards and Technology, the Social Security Administration, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the General Services Administration. In addition to Executive Order 11246, OFCCP enforces Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974. These three laws require those who do business with the federal government, both contractors and subcontractors, to follow the fair and reasonable standard that they not discriminate in employment on the basis of sex, race, color, religion, national origin, disability or status as a protected veteran.

The aim of the project(s) is to improve government labor laws and respect for international labor standards while enhancing the effectiveness of worker organizations in representing workers' rights and interests. The project(s) will be funded up to four years and six months. In 2006, the government of Georgia withdrew its support for the labor inspectorate and scaled back legal protections of worker rights. The AFL-CIO submitted a petition to the U.S. Trade Representative in 2010, which is currently under review, to revoke Georgia's benefits under the Generalized System of Preference due to worker rights violations. The current governing Georgia Dream coalition has passed reforms to the labor code to bring the law more in line with international standards. Georgian officials now seek to implement the new provisions and have expressed interest in re-establishing the labor inspectorate. The project(s) announced today are designed to support these efforts and contribute to more effective dialogue among workers, employers, and government representatives in Georgia. Applications must be submitted by Oct. 2, 2013, at 5 p.m. EDT electronically via http://www.grants.gov (link is external) or hard copy to the U.S. Department of Labor, Office of Procurement Services, 200 Constitution Ave. NW, Room S-4307, Washington, D.C. 20210, Attention: Brenda White.

The judgment follows an investigation by the department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration that found plan assets were improperly transferred and commingled with the Lemont-based company’s operating funds between Jan. 1, 2009 and Sept. 30, 2010, in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. “People entrusted with workers’ retirement plans must be held accountable when they fail to uphold that trust,” said Jeff Monhart, acting director of EBSA’s Chicago Regional Office, which conducted the investigation. “We at the department are committed to helping workers obtain their rightful benefits when plan fiduciaries violate the law.” Cougar Package Designers provided protective packaging until it was dissolved in August 2010, following a lawsuit brought by MB Financial Bank. Through its owners, Cougar Packaging Solutions Inc. bought part of the assets of Cougar Package Designers and continued the operations of the company but did not adopt the retirement plan. Because the plan was not adopted, its governing documents required that it be terminated. The complaint names Mark A. Cottone, president of Cougar Package Designers, and John Senese, president of Cougar Packaging Solutions. The complaint alleged that, instead of terminating the plan, Cottone informed participants on Sept. 10, 2010, that he needed all of the plan’s remaining assets to resolve the MB Financial Bank suit and to make possible the reorganization of Cougar Package Designers as Cougar Packaging Solutions. The complaint further alleged that the assets were used for company operations as well as to pay creditors and fund the formation of Cougar Packaging Solutions Inc., a successor company. As of Dec. 31, 2010, the latest date for which information is available, the plan had less than $900 in liquid assets. As part of the judgment, Cottone and Senese will each forfeit any claim they have to assets of the Cougar Package Designers Inc. Profit Sharing Plan. Cottone has been removed as the fiduciary to the Cougar Package Designers Inc. Profit Sharing Plan, and both Cottone and Senese are permanently enjoined from serving as a fiduciary or service provider to any ERISA-covered plan in the future. The court appointed Lefoldt & Co. P.A. to serve as the independent fiduciary to administer and terminate the plan and forward assets to qualified participants. The Labor Department’s regional solicitor in Chicago litigated this case in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois in Chicago.

The monthly inspections, which began in April 2010 following the explosion at the Upper Big Branch Mine, involve mines that merit increased agency attention and enforcement because of their poor compliance history or particular compliance concerns. These matters include high numbers of violations or closure orders; frequent hazard complaints or hotline calls; plan compliance issues; inadequate workplace examinations; a high number of accidents, injuries or illnesses; fatalities; adverse conditions such as increased methane liberation, faulty roof conditions and inadequate ventilation, and respirable dust. ""After Upper Big Branch, we undertook an aggressive strategy to compel mine operators to take responsibility for the safety and health of their workers,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""The data we've collected from our impact inspection program, which strategically targets problem mines, shows compliance is improving and that we continue to move the mine safety needle in the right direction."" From April 2010 through June 2013, total violations (per 100 on-site inspection hours) decreased 18 percent in coal mines and 18 percent in metal/nonmetal mines; significant and substantial violations decreased 23 percent in coal mines and 37 percent in metal/nonmetal mines; unwarrantable failure violations decreased 45 percent in coal mines and 65 percent in metal/nonmetal mines, and operator-reported lost-time injuries per 200,000 hours worked decreased 9 percent in coal mines and 26 percent in metal/nonmetal mines. ""These impact inspections are a critical part of MSHA's enforcement efforts to make sure mine operators take seriously their legal obligation to ensure that miners go home safe and healthy at the end of their shift,"" added Main. ""MSHA will continue this increased scrutiny at mines that warrant it, which is adding to the safety progress we are making in the mining community.""

The grants are intended to accelerate actions to reduce UI improper payment rates; provide an opportunity for modernizing UI tax and benefits systems, and enable the design of technology-based tools to prevent, detect and recover improper UI payments. ""The unemployment insurance program is a lifeline to people who have lost a job through no fault of their own,"" said Eric Seleznow, acting assistant secretary of labor for employment and training. ""We have a responsibility to ensure this program is run efficiently and effectively so that this critical safety net continues to be available in the future."" In Fiscal Year 2011, ETA provided $192 million in supplemental grant awards to 42 states for integrity activities. In FY 2012, a total of $169 million in supplemental grant awards was provided to 33 states for the prevention, detection, and recovery of improper UI benefit payments. The FY 2013 funding provides an opportunity for states to go beyond improper payments to focus on additional UI technology system improvements, data exchange enhancements for UI for Ex-military Service members, and integration of state UI, Employment Service, and Workforce Investment Act IT systems. In order to qualify for FY2013 funding, states must implement or commit to implement a set of core integrity strategies. The core strategies include a business process analysis for state workforce agencies with improper payment rates above 10 percent and for agencies identified for poor performance concerning first payment and appeals timeliness; the implementation or expansion of the State Information Data Exchange System; the implementation of a state-specific prevention strategy for reducing improper payments; and a commitment to maintaining a state integrity cross-functional task force. In addition, states committing to implement all of the core activities, or have already implemented the core activities, will be eligible to apply for technology infrastructure project funding. These funds will be used to modify and/or develop one of the core UI benefits or tax and benefit system designs; design additional core UI tax and/or benefit systems using open source components that are exportable to other states; and implement technology-based tools designed to prevent, detect or collect/recover improper UI payments.

The judgment resolves a lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that Mordo violated her fiduciary duties under ERISA. The lawsuit alleged that Mordo authorized the pension plans to make improper loans and transfers of plan assets over several years to multiple recipients, including members of the Mordo family and International Design Concepts LLC and Apparel Group International LLC, two companies in which Mordo had an ownership interest.

Borzi. ""That's not just common sense; it's the law, and the Labor Department will not hesitate to investigate and pursue appropriate legal remedies whenever fiduciaries fail to meet this standard."" The judgment removes Mordo from any and all fiduciary positions with respect to the plans and permanently bars her from serving as a fiduciary to any ERISA-covered plan. It also appoints David M. Lipkin of Metro Benefits Inc. as the independent fiduciary who will administer the plans, determine and pay out benefits to participants, and terminate the plans. The Labor Department is authorized to seek a contempt order should Mordo violate any terms of the judgment. Sadimara Knitwear Inc. and Stallion Knits Ltd. were garment companies headquartered in Manhattan. The companies, which are no longer in operation, sponsored the plans to provide pension benefits to their employees. This case resulted from an investigation by EBSA's New York Regional Office. It was litigated by the Labor Department's Regional Office of the Solicitor in New York.

""The destruction caused by this severe storm affected communities across Arkansas,"" said Eric Seleznow, acting assistant secretary of labor for employment and training. ""There is a great deal of recovery work to be done, and the Labor Department is committed to helping Arkansans rebuild their communities."" The grant was awarded to the Arkansas Department of Workforce Services to restore public lands and infrastructure by providing temporary work to those in need of employment. The funds will be used to assist with cleanup, demolition, repair, renovation and reconstruction of destroyed public facilities and lands in affected communities as well as humanitarian assistance. Of the $1,054,112 approved today, $351,371 will be released initially. Additional funding, up to the approved amount, will be made available to the state as it demonstrates a continued need for assistance.

"July 22, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20130722-0,Labor Department permits 401(k) plans to reschedule annual disclosures to employees,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor today announced a temporary enforcement policy that will allow 401(k)-type plans to reset the timing for the annual distribution of the investment comparative chart that they are required to furnish to plan participants. Most plans must furnish this year's annual comparative chart no later than August 30, 2013. ""Under this policy, employers may reset their deadline for furnishing the comparative chart, but only once and only if the responsible plan fiduciary determines that doing so will benefit the plan's participants and beneficiaries,"" said Assistant Secretary for Employee Benefits Security Phyllis C. Borzi. ""We are announcing this policy in response to requests from a number of employers who say it will be better for their workers if the comparative chart could be mailed out a little later in the year along with other disclosures. But, otherwise, all the protections in the rule stay in place."" Under the enforcement policy contained in Field Assistance Bulletin 2013-02, plan administrators may reset the deadline one time, for either the 2013 or the 2014 comparative chart, if the responsible plan fiduciary determines that doing so will benefit the plan's participants and beneficiaries and provided that no more than 18 months may pass before participants receive their next comparative chart. This enforcement policy does not alter a plan administrator's obligations under the regulation to timely update the investment information that is available at the plan's internet web address or to notify participants about changes to investment information, such as a new plan investment option. The department's participant-level fee disclosure regulation, which was implemented last year, requires that administrators of 401(k)-type plans disclose information about plan investment options, such as fee and performance information, to participants and beneficiaries at least annually. Plans operating on a calendar year had to furnish their first chart no later than August 30, 2012, and their second chart is due no later than August 30, 2013. Many other plan disclosures, however, such as pension benefit statements, are disclosed later in the calendar year. Permitting a one-time ""re-set"" of the deadline will allow plan administrators to align the comparative chart with other participant disclosures.

"July 19, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ilab/ilab20130719,Statement by the U.S. Government on Labor Rights and Factory Safety in Bangladesh,"WASHINGTON  The following is a joint statement from the Department of Labor, Office of the United States Trade Representative, and the State Department: Today, the United States is outlining next steps in a longstanding effort to address in a meaningful way worker safety problems in Bangladesh — the severity of which were exemplified in the tragedies of the November 2012 Tazreen Fashions factory fire and the April 2013 Rana Plaza building collapse — and, more broadly, the ability of Bangladeshi workers to exercise their full range of labor rights. On June 27, 2013, President Obama announced his decision to suspend Bangladesh's trade benefits under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) in view of insufficient progress by the Government of Bangladesh in affording Bangladeshi workers internationally recognized worker rights. That decision followed an extensive, interagency review under the GSP program of worker rights and worker safety in Bangladesh during which the U.S. Government encouraged the Government of Bangladesh to implement needed reforms. At the time of the announcement, the Administration provided the Government of Bangladesh with an action plan which, if implemented, could provide a basis for the President to consider the reinstatement of GSP trade benefits. Today, the Administration is making this action plan public as a means to reinforce and support the efforts of all international stakeholders to promote improved worker rights and worker safety in Bangladesh. On the basis of this action plan, the United States looks forward to continuing to work with Bangladesh on the actions it needs to take in relation to potential reinstatement of GSP benefits. The United States is also pleased to associate itself with the July 8, 2013 European Union (EU)-Bangladesh-International Labor Organization (ILO) Sustainability Compact for continuous improvements in labour rights and factory safety in the ready-made garment and knitwear industry in Bangladesh (Compact) . The United States looks forward to working as a full partner with the EU, Bangladesh, and the ILO to implement the goals of the Compact, many of which are broadly consistent with the GSP action plan we are releasing today. At the same time, the United States will pursue additional concrete actions required under the GSP action plan, such as increasing sanctions for labor violations sufficient to deter future misconduct, publicly reporting on the outcome of union registration applications, establishing an effective complaint mechanism for labor violations, and ending violence and harassment of labor activists and unions. In addition to these complementary, government-to-government efforts, the Administration recognizes the importance of efforts by retailers and brands to ensure that the factories from which they source are compliant with all fire and safety standards in Bangladesh. We urge the retailers and brands to take steps needed to help advance changes in the Bangladeshi garment sector and to work together and with other stakeholders to ensure that their efforts are coordinated and sustained. The Administration looks forward to continuing its engagement with the Government of Bangladesh and all stakeholders in order to effect positive change for Bangladeshi workers and to help ensure that the recent tragedies we have witnessed do not recur. Bangladesh Action Plan 2013 The United States Government encourages the Government of Bangladesh (GOB) to take significant actions to provide a basis for reinstating Bangladesh’s Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) benefits, including by implementing commitments under the ""National Tripartite Plan of Action on Fire Safety and Structural Integrity"" and taking the following actions: Government Inspections for Labor, Fire and Building Standards Develop, in consultation with the International Labor Organization (ILO), and implement in line with already agreed targets, a plan to increase the number of government labor, fire and building inspectors, improve their training, establish clear procedures for independent and credible inspections, and expand the resources at their disposal to conduct effective inspections in the readymade garment (RMG), knitwear, and shrimp sectors, including within Export Processing Zones (EPZs). Increase fines and other sanctions, including loss of import and export licenses, applied for failure to comply with labor, fire, or building standards to levels sufficient to deter future violations. Develop, in consultation with the ILO, and implement in line with already agreed targets, a plan to assess the structural building and fire safety of all active RMG/knitwear factories and initiate remedial actions, close or relocate inadequate factories, where appropriate. Create a publicly accessible database/matrix of all RMG/knitwear factories as a platform for reporting labor, fire, and building inspections, including information on the factories and locations, violations identified, fines and sanctions administered, factories closed or relocated, violations remediated, and the names of the lead inspectors. Establish directly or in consultation with civil society an effective complaint mechanism, including a hotline, for workers to confidentially and anonymously report fire, building safety, and worker rights violations. Ready Made Garments (RMG)/Knitwear Sector Enact and implement, in consultation with the ILO, labor law reforms to address key concerns related to freedom of association and collective bargaining. Continue to expeditiously register unions that present applications that meet administrative requirements, and ensure protection of unions and their members from anti-union discrimination and reprisal. Publicly report information on the status and final outcomes of individual union registration applications, including the time taken to process the applications and the basis for denial if relevant, and information on collective bargaining agreements concluded. Register non-governmental labor organizations that meet administrative requirements, including the Bangladesh Center for Worker Solidarity (BCWS) and Social Activities for the Environment (SAFE). Drop or expeditiously resolve pending criminal charges against labor activists to ensure workers and their supporters do not face harassment or intimidation. Advance a transparent investigation into the murder of Aminul Islam and report on the findings of this investigation. Publicly report on the database/matrix identified above on anti-union discrimination or other unfair labor practice complaints received and labor inspections completed, including information on factories and locations, status of investigations, violations identified, fines and sanctions levied, remediation of violations, and the names of the lead inspectors. Develop and implement mechanisms, including a training program for industrial police officers who oversee the RMG sector on workers’ freedom of association and assembly, in coordination with the ILO, to prevent harassment, intimidation and violence against labor activists and unions. Export Processing Zones Repeal or commit to a timeline for expeditiously bringing the EPZ law into conformity with international standards so that workers within EPZ factories enjoy the same freedom of association and collective bargaining rights as other workers in the country. Create a government-working group and begin the repeal or overhaul of the EPZ law, in coordination with the ILO. Issue regulations that, until the EPZ law has been repealed or overhauled, will ensure the protection of EPZ workers’ freedom of association, including by prohibiting ""blacklisting"" and other forms of exclusion from the zones for labor activities. Issue regulations that, until the EPZ law is repealed or overhauled, will ensure transparency in the enforcement of the existing EPZ law and that require the same inspection standards and procedures as in the rest of the RMG sector. Shrimp Processing Sector Actively support ILO and other worker-employer initiatives in the shrimp sector, such as the March 2013 Memorandum of Agreement, to ensure the strengthening of freedom of association, including addressing anti-union discrimination and unfair labor practices. Publicly report on anti-union discrimination or other unfair labor practice complaints received and labor inspections completed, including information on factories and locations, status of investigations, violations identified, fines and sanctions levied, remediation of violations, and the names of the lead inspectors."

The agreement settles allegations that the Massachusetts-based federal contractor violated provisions of Executive Order 11246 by retaliating against employees that OFCCP had determined were victims of discrimination in an earlier investigation. ""Our job is to protect workers, promote diversity and enforce the law,"" said OFCCP Director Patricia A. Shiu. ""That responsibility to workers continues long after an investigation ends. Any effort to retaliate against workers who have already been victimized by unfair treatment only compounds the problem and will not be tolerated by this administration."" In May 2009, Tufts agreed to hire minority workers as customer service representatives to settle an OFCCP finding that the contractor's hiring practices discriminated against minorities. On March 10, 2010, OFCCP received a complaint of discrimination from an individual hired under that agreement, alleging he had been terminated due to his race and retaliated against due to his status as an OFCCP class member. The worker alleged that minority class members were segregated from other employees and held to stricter standards than non-class members during the training program. OFCCP's subsequent investigation determined that retaliation against 12 class members occurred in the timing, application and implementation of the company's customer service training program, resulting in their termination from the program. In addition to paying $372,739 to the class members, Tufts has agreed to ensure full compliance with Executive Order 11246 by providing training to managers and trainers involved in enforcing the equal employment opportunity and non-retaliation provisions of the Executive Order. Tufts Associated Health Plans Inc. offers a full array of health coverage options including Medicare Part D prescription benefits, which it offers under a contract with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for the operation of a Voluntary Medicare Prescription Drug Plan. The total contract amount for Part D prescription benefits for the period of January through May 2012 alone was $84.5 million. In addition to Executive Order 11246, OFCCP enforces Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974. These three laws require those who do business with the federal government, both contractors and subcontractors, to follow the fair and reasonable standard that they not discriminate in employment on the basis of sex, race, color, religion, national origin, disability or status as a protected veteran.

The accounts include bank accounts in the name of plan trustee Penn Public Trust, plan fiduciary John J. Koresko V and the Koresko Law Firm. The order issued by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, followed a July 8 hearing. At that hearing, the court heard arguments regarding the appropriate form of interim relief pending an evidentiary hearing that is currently scheduled for Aug.12 on the department’s Application for a Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction. That application was aimed at preserving the assets of the welfare benefit plans sponsored by employers nationwide, and was filed in an ongoing lawsuit brought by the department in 2006 against PennMont, Penn Public Trust, John J. Koresko V, his law firm and other defendants. The 2006 complaint alleged violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. According to the court’s July 8 order, the department and private litigants established a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of their claim that the Koresko parties-- John J Koresko V, PennMont Benefit Services, Inc., Penn Public Trust, Koresko Law Firm PC, and Koresko and Associates PC-- breached their fiduciary obligations to the ERISA plans being administered by them. The court also found that the department and the private litigants have a substantial likelihood of showing that the Koresko parties engaged in a pattern of moving plan assets, in the form of death benefit and insurance policy loan proceeds, through at least 28 different bank accounts, held in the name of at least 19 different entities, at no fewer than four banks; commingled plan assets with other funds; and misappropriated funds from those commingled accounts for their own benefit. In addition, the court found that the department and private litigants have a substantial likelihood of showing that the Koresko parties used plan assets to pay Koresko and his law firm for services to the trust, and that Koresko, by acting as both the fiduciary and a service provider to the trust, who also appeared to set his own rates for his services, placed himself in the position of dual loyalties that ERISA prohibits. The district court had previously held that ERISA applied to certain employer-level plans that participated in the trust, and that the funds held in the trust were plan assets. The July 8 order freezes all funds in the 13 accounts until further order of the court, but authorizes PennMont and Penn Public Trust to pay premiums on life insurance policies out of one of the accounts. The department’s lawsuit was filed by the Philadelphia Regional Solicitor’s Office.

"July 16, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20130716-0,"Crestview, Fla., medical group ordered to restore $225,000 to employee stock ownership plan following US Labor Department investigation","CRESTVIEW, Fla. – The U.S. Department of Labor has obtained a consent judgment requiring Robert S. Caputo and Glenn M. Bankert to restore $225,000 to an employee stock ownership plan. The judgment follows a lawsuit filed by the department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration alleging the defendants breached their fiduciary responsibilities, in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. “Workers deserve to reap the full benefits of their hard-earned retirement savings,” said Isabel Colon, EBSA’s regional director in Atlanta. “This agency is committed to taking action on behalf of workers when plan fiduciaries fail in their duty to act solely in the interest of the participants.” The department filed the lawsuit in 2010 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida-Pensacola Division, alleging that the plan owned virtually all of the stock in Caputo’s medical practice, and that between 2000 and 2006, Caputo used assets of the medical practice as if they were his personal property. According to the suit, EBSA found that 97 percent of the practice’s assets were listed as receivables, but they were personal expenses and loans. It further alleged that the defendants violated ERISA by allowing the plan to purchase stock from participants at inflated prices; failed to allow older workers to diversify their account balance, as required by law; failed to keep accurate records; and failed to take action as the plan’s fiduciaries to remedy Caputo’s misuse of company funds. Additionally, the suit alleged that Stephen K. Thielking and his Iowa-based accounting firm Oden and Thielking, which annually valued the company’s stock, knew or should have known that the price of the stock was inflated. The department is seeking a court order to permanently bar Thielking and his firm from providing services to employee benefit plans and to reimburse all profits or financial benefit as a result of the violations. A trial date has been set for Sept. 16. Under the terms of the judgment, Caputo and Bankert will allow $225,000 of their employee stock ownership plan participant accounts to be applied as an offset against their debt to the stock ownership plan. The judgment also permanently bars the defendants from acting as fiduciaries to any employee benefit plan subject to ERISA and appoints an independent fiduciary to administer the plan. Robert S. Caputo D.O. is a for-profit medical group in Crestview that specializes in obstetrics and gynecology. The case was investigated by EBSA’s Atlanta Regional Office. It was litigated by the department’s Regional Office of the Solicitor in Atlanta.

""The grants announced today will help individuals and families facing unemployment get back to work quickly,"" said acting Secretary of Labor Seth D. Harris. ""This is a win-win-win for those looking for work, employers who want to pay less taxes and states struggling to control their budgets."" The funds will be used to provide UI beneficiaries with personalized, re-employment plans based on the claimant's career interests and local labor market information. These assessments are done in-person and participants will receive referrals to re-employment services and/or training provided by the American Job Center. The program will also allow for a complete review of the claimants eligibility for UI benefits, to help reduce incidences of improper payments. Two new states, Connecticut and Delaware, along with the Virgin Islands are receiving grants to implement an REA program while 36 additional states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia are being awarded additional funds to continue their programs. A recent report by Impaq International found strong evidence showing that re-employment and eligibility assessments expedite the return of the unemployed to the workforce.

"July 15, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ilab/ilab20130715,US Department of Labor announces $5 million grant solicitation to reduce child labor in Morocco,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of International Labor Affairs is seeking eligible applicants for a $5 million cooperative agreement to reduce child labor and help youth of legal working age secure decent work in Morocco. The project will focus on supporting efforts in rural areas and areas in the process of urbanization that immediately adjoin cities and towns. The project also will improve the capacity of Morocco's labor inspectorate to monitor and enforce labor laws in rural agricultural areas and strengthen the ability of civil society organizations to reduce child labor through service provision and advocacy. According to the latest available data, child labor is predominantly a rural problem in Morocco that is directly related to the poverty and low educational levels of parents. Although laws exist to protect children from exploitative labor, the government's capacity to enforce them in rural agricultural areas is weak. Locally-based civil society organizations are often the primary service providers in rural areas and those areas in the process of urbanization; however, they frequently lack the capacity to address the full scope of the problem. One or more qualifying organizations will receive funding to improve access to education and training for youth ages 12 to 17, develop training and decent work opportunities for children of legal working age, and link children and families to social services and livelihood opportunities that eliminate the need for child labor. Applications must be submitted by Oct. 1 at 5 p.m. EDT electronically via http://www.grants.gov or by hard copy to the U.S. Department of Labor, Office of Procurement Services, 200 Constitution Ave. NW, Room S-4307, Washington, D.C. 20210, Attention: Brenda White.

"July 10, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20130710,MSHA releases final data for 2012,"ARLINGTON, Va. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration today announced the release of final data for 2012 that indicate the lowest fatality and injury rates in the history of U.S. mining, along with the lowest rate of contractor fatalities since the agency began calculating those rates in 1983. Thirty-six miners died on the job in 2012. The 2012 total includes the Dec. 28 death of a coal miner at Choctaw Mine in Walker County, Ala., that was recently deemed chargeable to the mining industry. Five contractors died in mining accidents in 2012, compared to 11 in 2011, nearly half the lowest number ever recorded. ""While more needs to be done to protect the nation's miners, we are moving mine safety in the right direction. The actions undertaken by MSHA and the mining community were the key to the continuing improvements we saw in 2012,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""All miners deserve the safest possible working conditions."" Compliance with the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 also continued to improve in 2012, with an 18 percent reduction in violations cited by MSHA since 2010. As a result, penalties for violations dropped. Although the number of mines in the United States decreased slightly (from 14,176 in 2011 to 14,093 in 2012), the number of miners increased from 381,209 to 387,878. In 2012, the fatality rate was .0110 deaths per 200,000 hours worked. The rate of reported injuries was 2.56 per 200,000 hour worked. These reductions replace the prior year's record historical low rates. The number of citations and orders MSHA issued fell from 156,802 in 2011 to 139,770 in 2012, an 11 percent decrease. Penalty assessments dropped from $160.8 million in 2011 to $120.5 million in 2012. In coal mining, 20 miners died in on-the-job accidents in 2012, the second lowest number ever. The fatality rate was .0159 deaths per 200,000 hours worked, also the second lowest ever recorded. The rate of reported injuries was 3.16 per 200,000 hours worked, the lowest ever recorded. The number of citations and orders issued declined, from 93,330 in 2011 to 79,250 in 2012, a 15 percent reduction. The coal industry saw decreases in the number of mines (from 1,973 to 1,871) and in production (from 1,095 to 1,018 million tons) between 2011 and 2012. While the number of coal miners also decreased from a decades-long high of 143,437 in 2011 to 137,650 in 2012, it was the second highest for any year since 1994. In metal and nonmetal mining, the record-low fatality rate was .0079 deaths per 200,000 hours worked. Sixteen miners died in on-the-job accidents, equaling the record low set in 2011. The reported injury rate of 2.19 per 200,000 hours worked also was a record low. Citations and orders issued dropped from 63,472 in 2011 to 60,520 in 2012, a 5 percent reduction. While the number of metal and nonmetal mines remained steady in 2012, at 12,193, the number of miners increased from 237,772 in 2011 to 250,228 in 2012.

Donnelly withheld employee contributions in the approximate amount of $3,400.46, failed to segregate the contributions from company assets as soon as they reasonably could do so and failed to timely forward them to the Hartford Construction Group LLC 401(k) profit sharing plan. During the period that participant contributions were not remitted to the Hartford Plan as required, defendants caused or allowed the contributions to be commingled with the general assets of Hartford. Defendants had failed to take action to restore to the Hartford Plan the full amount of the un-remitted contributions plus lost interest in the approximate amount of $513.99 as of Oct. 1, 2012. Defendants failed to monitor, control or attempt to rectify the acts of one another with respect to the Hartford Plan. The complaint further alleged that on or about Oct. 22, 2009, Humana Employers Health Plan of Georgia Inc.

"July 5, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20130705,Statement of acting Labor Secretary Seth D. Harrison on June employment numbers,"WASHINGTON – Acting Secretary of Labor Seth D. Harris issued the following statement about the June 2013 Employment Situation report released today: ""This morning's report reveals an economy continuing to recover at a promising rate. With the addition of 202,000 private sector jobs in June, that makes 7.2 million private sector jobs over the last 40 consecutive months of growth. ""The unemployment rate held steady at 7.6 percent – the tenth straight month that joblessness was below 8 percent (following three-and-a-half straight years of greater than 8 percent unemployment). Average hourly earnings are up as well, having risen 10 cents in June and by 51 cents (or 2.2 percent) over the year. That means more workers with more money to spend in their communities, helping our economy continue to grow further. ""There were notable employment increases in several sectors, including leisure and hospitality (+75,000), professional and business services (+53,000), retail trade (+37,000), and financial activities (+17,000, more than double its prior 12-month average). The June report also included upward revisions in total nonfarm payroll employment for April and May – a total of 70,000 more jobs than previously reported. ""This morning's report is good news. But our economy still is not performing at its full potential, still not recovering with the speed and strength that working families need. There are steps we can take to encourage more vigorous economic growth. President Obama's economic strategy couples long-term deficit reduction with short-term investments that will put Americans back to work now. But to date, Congress has failed to act decisively on a broad jobs agenda, instead preferring a misguided austerity approach that has slowed the recovery and hurt the middle class. ""The U.S. Senate, however, recently passed a bill to fix our broken immigration system in a way that will improve border security and significantly strengthen our economy. The Congressional Budget Office has concluded that immigration reform will increase GDP by 3.3 percent and employment by 3.5 percent over the next decade, while reducing the deficit substantially and ensuring full Social Security solvency through 2035. It will put 11 million people on an earned path to citizenship, shutting down a shadow economy that depresses wages and undermines the competitiveness of businesses that play by the rules. ""The House should quickly follow the Senate's lead and pass comprehensive immigration reform. Congress should send a bipartisan bill to the White House for the President's signature as soon as possible."""

Judge Feldman held that Armstrong's state court suit unlawfully interfered with Shemwell's rights under the Mine Act, and that the suit was preempted by the Mine Act and was baseless and retaliatory. The case arose after Armstrong discharged Shemwell in September 2011. The miner filed a complaint with MSHA, a U.S. Department of Labor agency, claiming that the discharge was in retaliation for his safety activities at the mine. Attorneys for the secretary of labor filed an application for temporary reinstatement on his behalf. After a hearing, Judge Feldman found that Shemwell's complaint was not frivolously brought and ordered him to be temporarily reinstated. Following MSHA's decision not to pursue Shemwell's discrimination case on the merits, Armstrong filed a civil tort suit against him in state court, seeking compensatory and punitive damages. The action was based on Armstrong's assertion that Shemwell intentionally initiated a false discrimination action for the sole purpose of imposing litigation costs on Armstrong. The company maintained that ""the First Amendment right to file... a petition in court trumps all other interests, statutes or rights."" Attorneys for the secretary of labor argued that defending against such a state court action could be ""financially devastating"" to a miner, and would ""dissuade a reasonable miner from making or supporting a charge of discrimination."" The attorneys for the secretary said the state civil action is not protected under the First Amendment right to petition because it is federally preempted by the Mine Act. Even if it were not in conflict with the Mine Act, they argued, the civil suit is not worthy of First Amendment protection because it is baseless and retaliatory. ""To allow a state court to grant monetary damages against a miner for filing a safety-related complaint, a remedy that was authorized by Congress in the Mine Act, would undermine the goal the Act seeks to accomplish – miner participation in safety matters,"" said Judge Feldman. He also stated, ""Miners must be free to file safety-related complaints regardless of whether they are ultimately determined to be meritorious."" ""We are pleased the judge recognized, in the Armstrong Coal decision, that the judicial process cannot be used to violate the rights of a miner under the Mine Act,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. According to Section 105(c) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, a miner cannot be discharged, discriminated against or interfered with in the exercise of statutory rights because he or she has engaged in a protected activity such as filing a complaint alleging a health or safety violation, or refusing to work under unsafe or unhealthy conditions. The Act provides that a miner who has a non-frivolous claim of discrimination may be temporarily reinstated to his job pending final order on the complaint."

"July 1, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20130701,US Department of Labor and US Postal Service agree to terms on improving worker safety at postal facilities,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the U.S. Postal Service and the American Postal Workers Union have agreed to terms of a settlement that will improve safety in postal facilities across the country. The settlement follows negotiations stemming from inspections at 42 Postal Service sites in 2009 and 2010 that found violations of OSHA standards on electrical work practices. USPS contested the citations, and OSHA then sought enterprise-wide relief before the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. ""As a large employer, with a substantial number of affected employees throughout many different types of facilities, the U.S. Postal Service faced many challenges in improving their electrical safe-work program,"" said Dr. David Michaels, assistant secretary of labor for occupational safety and health. ""In entering this agreement, OSHA recognizes the Postal Service's commitment and dedication to worker safety."" As part of the settlement, which covers all Postal Service facilities nationwide, including processing and distribution centers and post offices, USPS has revised its written policies and procedures on electrical work, prohibiting workers from working on electrically energized equipment except for a defined set of tasks that can only be performed while equipment is energized, such as troubleshooting and testing. To ensure compliance with these electrical safety policies, USPS will assign a trained electrical work plan coordinator at each facility. In addition, USPS will provide and require the use of electrically protective gloves and full body arc flash protection for energized work, including voltage testing. ""Employee safety has always been a top priority for the Postal Service,"" said Jeffrey Williamson, USPS chief human resources officer and executive vice president. ""We are happy to have resolved this issue amicably and in the best interests of the safety of our employees."" USPS has also agreed to audit the implementation of the electrical safe-work program at all maintenance-capable facilities, and report the results in detail to OSHA quarterly during the two-year term of the agreement. In addition, OSHA will meet with the Postal Service on a regular basis to discuss the results of OSHA monitoring inspections and USPS audits, as well as any concerns or problems encountered. Also, USPS will retrain all employees performing electrical work to comply with OSHA requirements for electrical work. Supervisors and affected employees also will receive additional training on electrical safe-work practices. Cliff Guffey, president of the American Postal Workers Union, AFL-CIO, said, ""The APWU is pleased to be a part of this landmark commitment to worker safety, which will ensure the protection of postal workers from electrical hazards."" Under the settlement, the Postal Service has agreed to pay $100,000 at signing and a suspended payment of $3 million pending full abatement of the hazards. OSHA will monitor the Postal Service's progress toward abatement and evaluate that progress against negotiated milestones. Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. OSHA's role is to ensure these conditions for America's working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education and assistance.

ILAB's African Youth Empowerment and Development Initiative is designed to support President Obama's Young African Leaders Initiative. The president's program is focused on investing in the next generation of African leaders and strengthening partnerships between the United States and Africa. The ILAB-funded effort will address exploitative child labor by providing vulnerable youth ages 14 through 18 with education and vocational training and, for those of appropriate age, decent work opportunities. It is also intended to promote leadership, entrepreneurship, and civic engagement by youth within their communities. This project is intended to serve as a pilot initiative that could be replicated in other African countries. Uganda has the youngest population in the world, with an average age of 15 years. The majority of Ugandan youth drop out of school during primary school. Too often, those who work lack the training, skills, and other means needed to avoid dangerous work and escape from poverty. Applications must be submitted by Tuesday, Oct. 1, 2013, at 5 p.m. EDT electronically via http://www.grants.gov or by hard copy to the U.S. Department of Labor, Office of Procurement Services, 200 Constitution Ave. NW, Room S-4307, Washington, D.C. 20210, Attention: Brenda White.

The department's lawsuit alleges that the LeBlancs violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 by using assets belonging to the employee retirement and insurance plans for the benefit of their business operations. ""The defendants had a duty to manage and protect their employees' benefit plans and their assets, and they failed to do that,"" said Deborah Perry, director of the Dallas Regional Office of the department's Employee Benefits Security Administration, which investigated this case. ""The department will take every action necessary to restore plan assets that were not properly preserved for the company's workers."" Doctors Hospital of Shreveport, La., was a small, specialty hospital that ceased operations in February 2010. An EBSA investigation revealed that for three months prior to its closing, the defendants used employee retirement contributions and insurance premium payments to run the hospital and pay creditors. The department seeks a court order requiring the restoration of all plan losses and barring the LeBlancs from serving in any capacity in an employee benefit plan. At the time of the violations, approximately 56 employee participants were affected by the missing retirement contributions and insurance premium payments.

"June 27, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20130627,D.C. Circuit Court upholds determination involving MSHAs emergency lifeline standard,"ARLINGTON, Va. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration today applauded a decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which held that the failure to maintain emergency lifelines in a manner for miners to use effectively is a significant and substantial violation of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, regardless of the likelihood of a mine emergency actually occurring at the time of the violation. The court unanimously upheld the secretary of labor's interpretation that, in evaluating the significant and substantial nature of violations of standards that come into play only in the event of an emergency, one must assume the occurrence of the emergency. The court agreed that ""emergency safety standards are fundamentally different from non-emergency standards because they are designed to apply meaningfully only in times of emergency."" Under Section 104(d)(1) of the Mine Act, if the authorized representative finds that there has been a violation of a mandatory health or safety standard and also finds that the violation ""is of such nature as could significantly and substantially contribute to the cause and effect of a coal or other mine safety or health hazard,"" then the inspector is to include that finding in the citation issued for the violation. Such a finding of a significant and substantial violation is a precondition for enhanced enforcement actions under the Mine Act. In its June 7 ruling, the court upheld a determination by the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission that a mining company's failures regarding emergency lifelines were in violation of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. The appeal involved Cumberland Coal Resources LP's Cumberland Mine in Greene County, Pa. Cumberland argued that the commission applied the wrong standard when it reversed an administrative law judge's determination that the violations were not significant and substantial, and that even if it applied the correct standard, its findings were not supported by substantial evidence. During a December 2007 inspection, an MSHA special investigator inspected four of Cumberland Mine's escapeways over a four-day period and issued a citation for each, alleging a violation of the lifeline requirement. The investigator designated each violation as significant and substantial, finding that, in the event of an emergency, requiring miners to use the lifeline and the location of the lifeline would have delayed miners' escape, and that the delay would have been reasonably likely to result in serious injury or death. The regulation at issue in this case was implemented as a result of amendments to the Mine Act enacted in response to three multiple-fatality mine disasters in 2006 at Sago, Aracoma and Darby mines, in which miners who were unable to successfully evacuate mines died. Specifically, the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006 (MINER Act) requires mine operators to provide flame resistant and directional lifelines in escapeways to enable evacuation. Also in response to the disasters, the secretary of labor promulgated an emergency temporary standard, which became final, requiring lifelines to be located in a manner for miners to use effectively to escape. ""Mine emergency protections need to be in place before an emergency occurs,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""The court recognized that the absence of such protections is a serious matter, to be taken seriously if miners are to have these protections when they need them the most."""
"June 27, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20130627-0,US Department of Labor awards nearly $72 million in YouthBuild grants,"68 programs across 33 states and the District of Columbia receive funding WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor today announced the award of nearly $72 million in YouthBuild grants to support academic and occupational skill training for at-risk youth. ""The YouthBuild program has demonstrated a record of elevating the opportunities and prospects for good, middle-class jobs for thousands of young people throughout this nation,"" said acting Secretary of Labor Seth D. Harris. ""These grants reflect our shared commitment to investing in the future of our nation's youth and the belief that those investments will yield dividends for generations to come."" The grants range from approximately $600,000 to $1.1 million each and will fund 68 YouthBuild programs in 33 states and the District of Columbia. The programs will help nearly 4,600 young people obtain the certifications and skills necessary to achieve economic self-sufficiency. Along with the programs funded today, the Labor Department now actively funds 247 YouthBuild programs around the country. YouthBuild is a nonresidential, community-based alternative education program that provides classroom instruction and occupational skills training to at-risk individuals ages 16 to 24. The classroom training leads to a high school diploma, general education development or other state-recognized equivalency diploma. The occupational skills training component provides YouthBuild participants with industry-recognized certifications in construction or other occupations. The construction skills training component teaches valuable skills through a program to build or rehabilitate housing for low-income or homeless individuals and families in their communities. Today's announcement marks the second competition in which YouthBuild programs expand occupational skills training beyond construction to include in-demand industries such as health care and information technology. This expansion provides opportunities for youth to gain training, credentials and skills that lead to career fulfillment for youth who have been in the juvenile justice system, are aging out of foster care, have dropped out of high school, or are otherwise at-risk of failing to reach key educational and career milestones. Leadership development and community service are also key elements of the YouthBuild program, helping to to ensure that the participants maintain a connection to their communities through service and volunteerism.

"June 26, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20130626,MSHA announces results of May impact inspections,"ARLINGTON, Va. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration today announced that federal inspectors issued 186 citations and nine orders during special impact inspections conducted at nine coal mines and five metal/nonmetal mines last month. The monthly inspections, which began in force in April 2010 following the explosion at the Upper Big Branch Mine, involve mines that merit increased agency attention and enforcement due to their poor compliance history or particular compliance concerns. These matters include high numbers of violations or closure orders; frequent hazard complaints or hotline calls; plan compliance issues; inadequate workplace examinations; a high number of accidents, injuries or illnesses; fatalities; adverse conditions such as increased methane liberation, faulty roof conditions and inadequate ventilation; and respirable dust. As an example from last month, MSHA conducted an impact inspection during the May 8 evening shift at Tram Energy LLC #1, in Floyd County, Ky., during which inspectors issued 23 citations and six unwarrantable failure orders. These include mining without required dust controls in place, failure to conduct adequate belt examinations, damaged conveyor belt structure and accumulations of combustible materials. On May 21, an additional 104(d)(2) order was issued for failure to conduct adequate examinations of the electrical mining equipment. As a result, the entire underground portion of the mine was shut down until May 30. The mine's ventilation plan requires a minimum air velocity of 4,000 cubic feet per minute where coal is being cut to direct dust away from miners. MSHA found a coal cutting machine operating with no air movement and no line curtain to control airflow. Visible float dust was observed suspended in the air. These conditions exposed miners to a potential explosion and increased their risk of developing black lung and other respiratory diseases. The mine operator failed to conduct adequate pre-shift examinations prior to permitting miners underground. MSHA cited hazardous conditions that should have been recognized by an adequate examination, including missing cones to mark an intersection of rail track, failure to maintain a refuge alternative within 1,000 feet of the working face, no sign indicating a door in the primary escapeway, and accumulations of combustible materials. Combustible materials, including loose coal, coal, coal and float dust, and debris, were under and in the adjacent entries and crosscuts along the entire length of the #1 belt conveyor and on the roof, ribs, floor and electrical installations along the #2 belt conveyor for three crosscuts. Hazardous conditions on the #1 conveyor belt flight were neither recorded in the record book nor corrected. The mine has been cited 32 times for similar violations over the past two years. Violations also were issued pertaining to the mine's approved emergency response plan. The communications and tracking system required to track the locations of miners in the event of a mine emergency was not functioning. ""While statistics on compliance with regulations and fatality and injury rates show mine safety is moving in the right direction, not all mines are cooperating,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""The conditions our inspectors observed at Tram Energy LLC #1, which resulted in the closure of the mine for more than three weeks, demonstrated a complete disregard for the health and safety of miners and for safe mining practices."" Since April 2010, MSHA has conducted 616 impact inspections and issued 10,483 citations, 970 orders and 44 safeguards. View the spreadsheet (PDF)"
"June 26, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20130626,US Department of Labor announces $58 million in state grants to train dislocated workers,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor today announced $58 million in funding to 30 states for expanded training of dislocated workers so they can acquire industry-recognized credentials that lead to new career opportunities. The grants to states will support on-the-job training, customized training, registered apprenticeships and other approaches that connect individuals with employers, with a focus on providing these services to those in long spells of unemployment. ""While economic conditions continue to improve across the country, millions of workers still face barriers in returning to work,"" said acting Secretary of Labor Seth D. Harris. ""These federal funds will strengthen the capacity of the states' workforce investment systems to deliver critical work-based learning and training to thousands of unemployed Americans."" States were invited to apply for the one-time funding in May and were asked to prioritize training efforts on workers who have been unemployed for 27 weeks or longer and were also encouraged to provide services to workers who are likely to soon exhaust their unemployment insurance benefits. The funding is being provided through Dislocated Worker Training National Emergency Grants, in recognition of high number of long-term unemployed individuals and the continuing negative impacts of widespread, small layoffs across the country. Dislocated workers often have lost their jobs through no fault of their own, such as when layoffs result from the permanent closure of an office or plant. Today's announcement reflects a commitment by the department's Employment and Training Administration to help dislocated workers become re-employed and to continue support for the nation's economic recovery. National Emergency Grants are part of the secretary of labor's discretionary fund and are awarded based on a state's ability to meet specific guidelines.

"June 26, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20130626-0,US Department of Labor awards more than $26 million in grants to help juvenile offenders prepare to enter the workforce,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor today awarded more than $26 million in grants to help improve long-term labor market prospects for youth involved in the juvenile justice system. The ""Face Forward"" grants were awarded to 28 community-based organizations to provide juvenile offenders with support services, training and skills development to help them obtain employment and overcome the stigma of a juvenile record. ""We should cultivate and encourage the enormous potential of the young people in our country, especially those who started life at a disadvantage. These grants offer young people a chance for success and the opportunity to build a better life for themselves, their families and their communities,"" said acting Secretary of Labor Seth D. Harris. Juvenile arrests can become a major barrier to inclusion and advancement in the workforce. To help overcome those barriers, grantees will collaborate with nonprofit legal services providers to assist in expunging the court records of juvenile offenders and/or provide diversion programs, as designated by the juvenile justice system. Grantees will also offer youth mentoring services, education and training leading to industry-recognized credentials and post-program support and follow-up services. Eligible juvenile offenders must be between ages 16 and 24, currently reside in the geographic area to be served; have never been involved with the adult federal, state or local criminal justice systems; have never been convicted of a sex-related offense other than prostitution; and be currently involved or have been involved in the juvenile justice system, or be candidates for diversion under state guidelines for juvenile diversion programs. Grants were awarded through a competitive process open to any nonprofit organization with 501(c)(3) status, unit of state or local government, or any Indian and Native American entity eligible for grants under Workforce Investment Act Section 166 in areas with high poverty and crime rates that met the requirements of the solicitation. The grants will operate for a period of 39 months, which include six months of planning, 24 months of operation, and a minimum of nine months of post-program support and follow-up services for each participant.

The decision follows an investigation by the department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration that found co-owners Karen S. Curry and Danny Woods transferred assets from the plan to the company’s checking account and failed to properly manage the plan’s assets, comingling employee contributions with the company’s general operating accounts in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. “Actions like these violate not just the law, but also the trust workers place in their employers,” said L. Joe Rivers, director of EBSA’s Cincinnati Regional Office, which conducted the investigation. “The Labor Department is committed to helping workers obtain their rightful benefits so that they can continue to provide for themselves and their families during retirement.” The department alleges that from Jan. 1, 2008, through Dec. 31, 2010, Curry and Woods knowingly withheld $85,232 in contributions and loan repayments to the plan from workers’ paychecks and commingled those funds with the general assets of the company. The funds were never remitted to the plan. Additionally, from July 15 through Dec. 12, 2008, Curry and Woods allegedly transferred or caused to be transferred $171,225 in plan assets into a checking account in the company’s name. The total amount due represents principal and lost opportunity cost from Jan. 1, 2008, through April 30, 2013. The judgment also permanently enjoins both Curry and Woods from serving as fiduciaries or service providers to any employee benefit plan subject to ERISA. Additionally, Curry and Woods are required to waive their rights to their entire individual account balances in the plan for allocation to other participants and to waive any right to their share of the unremitted contributions and loan repayments. An independent fiduciary, Lefoldt and Co. P.A., has been appointed by the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of Indiana to administer, terminate and distribute the plan’s assets to qualified participants. The case was litigated by the Labor Department’s associate regional solicitor in Cleveland.

An investigation conducted by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Employee Benefits Security Administration found that from January 2006 through May 2009, employee contributions were withheld by the company and deposited into the plan’s trust for periods ranging up to 178 days after they were deducted from the employees’ compensation. The investigation also found that from March 2009 to May 2009, the company did not deposit payroll deductions withheld from the employee’s compensation into the plan’s trust. The company ceased operations and filed for bankruptcy in 2009. In total, the profit sharing plan is owed approximately $22,027.46 in unremitted contributions and lost opportunity costs. The plan had approximately 46 participants entitled to a distribution benefit.

Holmes Safety Association to create a separate mine rescue program represents a critical component in a three-year effort by the Mine Safety and Health Administration to address gaps in how the nation responds to mine emergencies. ""We now have a new partner – a national organization to support and provide the necessary guidance for mine rescue,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. The Joseph A. Holmes Safety Association overwhelmingly approved a constitutional amendment and change to its bylaws to create a mine rescue component during its annual meeting June 4-6 in Virginia Beach, Va. The association will provide a forum for the mine rescue community to collaborate on best practices, procedures and training to enhance mine rescue capabilities for coal and metal/nonmetal mines. It also will serve as a vehicle to disseminate guidelines, training and tools to the mining community. ""Mine rescue is among the most dangerous and challenging types of rescue work undertaken in this country, and we owe those who volunteer for these high-risk missions the best training and support we can give them,"" said Main. ""This month's vote returns mine rescue to its roots within the Joseph A. Holmes Safety Association."" Since May 2010, MSHA has hosted three summits and held a number of events with the mine rescue community to discuss the latest improvements in mine rescue, identify remaining gaps in mine emergency response and preparedness, and decide what further actions are needed to ensure a swift and comprehensive response from government, industry and others in the event of a mine emergency. A meeting to establish the executive committee and officers of the new mine rescue organizational component of Holmes will take place on Oct. 29, 2013, at the National Mine Health and Safety Academy in Beaver, W.Va. The Joseph A. Holmes Safety Association, founded in 1916 to promote health and safety in mining, was named for Dr. Joseph A. Holmes, a mine safety pioneer and the first director of the U.S. Bureau of Mines. Holmes was instrumental in establishing and organizing mine rescue teams and training during the early part of the 20th century. The nonprofit organization consists of representatives from federal and state governments, mining organizations and labor."

One or more qualifying organizations will receive funding to support Afghanistan's efforts to reduce the worst forms of child labor in the production of home-based woven carpets. Each organization selected will partner with at least one company whose source of carpets is from home-based production sites. The project(s) will involve the development and implementation of a sustainable social compliance system for that company's carpet supply chain and establishment of an independent monitoring system to verify its compliance with company standards on child labor. For children working in home-based weaving workplaces, the project(s) will provide remediation services to support their withdrawal. In addition to social compliance, the project(s) will work to collect reliable data on child labor in the carpet supply chain in Afghanistan and will raise awareness on the dangers of child labor in the carpet industry. Children working in the carpet sector reportedly start as young as six or seven years old and can work up to 12 hours a day. They suffer from a number of poor working conditions, including exposure to dust from the wool and noxious fumes, resulting in respiratory diseases. Little awareness exists in Afghanistan about the hazards faced by children working in the sector.

"June 13, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ilab/ilab20130613,US Labor Department to fund projects to improve fire and building safety in Bangladesh,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of International Labor Affairs today announced a $2.5 million competitive grant solicitation to fund improvements in the enforcement and monitoring of fire and building safety standards to better protect workers in the ready-made garment sector of Bangladesh. Ready-made garment production has been central to Bangladesh's economic development, with the sector accounting for the vast majority of Bangladesh's exports to the United States. The industry also is the focus of longstanding concerns over violations of worker rights and workplace safety standards. The Government of Bangladesh has been the subject of a review under the Generalized System of Preferences trade program since 2007. Attention to these concerns has grown in the wake of the Tazreen Fashions factory fire last November that killed more than 100 garment workers and the Rana Plaza building collapse in late April that led to the loss of more than 1,200 lives. In recent months, the Government of Bangladesh, industry, worker and civil society organizations and other groups have engaged in stepped-up efforts to address fire and building safety concerns. The government and other stakeholders, however, have a great deal of additional work to do in order to implement existing and developing plans. The Department of Labor's funding of technical assistance represents one important element in a broader strategy to address these issues. The department will fund one or more recipients who will work to (1) strengthen the Bangladesh Government's ability to improve its enforcement of fire and building safety standards and (2) build the capacity of worker organizations to effectively monitor violations of fire and building safety standards and abate related hazards in the ready-made garment sector.

"June 13, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20130613,US Labor Department moves to protect workers with disabilities in crackdown on Rhode Island employer,"Wage and Hour Division refers case to US Justice Department PROVIDENCE, R.I. — As the result of a new strategic enforcement effort to remedy labor violations and protect workers with disabilities, the U.S. Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division has revoked authorization allowing Training Thru Placement, Inc., based in North Providence, to pay less than the current federal minimum wage to its workers after an investigation of the nonprofit educational and vocational training center found willful violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act. Specifically, the agency found that TTP failed to determine the appropriate sub-minimum wage to be paid to each worker as allowed under Section 14(c) of the FLSA, properly record and pay employees for all hours worked, and determine the prevailing wage rates for workers performing similar work in the area. The company also falsified documents in order to mislead investigators. In an effort to comprehensively redress violations under all applicable laws, the agency referred the matter to the U.S. Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division, which today announced an interim settlement agreement with the state of Rhode Island and the city of Providence that will resolve violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act for approximately 200 Rhode Islanders with intellectual and developmental disabilities. The FLSA, in general, requires that covered employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 for all hours worked, plus time and one-half their regular rates of pay, including commissions, bonuses and incentive pay, for hours worked beyond 40 per week. However, since its enactment in 1938, the FLSA has contained provisions designed to promote employment opportunities for individuals with disabilities. Section 14(c) of the act allows employers, after receiving a certificate of authorization from the Wage and Hour Division, to pay wages less than the federal minimum wage to workers with disabilities when their disabilities impair their productive capacities for the work being performed. ""The intent of the law is clear — that workers with disabilities deserve an opportunity to be given meaningful work and receive an income, and employers that provide those opportunities may pay such workers below the current federal minimum wage, but only when key conditions are met,"" said Mary Beth Maxwell, acting deputy administrator of the Wage and Hour Division. ""However, not all employers are vigilant in maintaining a well-run program that honors that intention and is in full compliance with the letter of the law. Being in compliance matters, and we will use all enforcement tools available, including revocation of certificates, to prevent employers from exploiting workers."" Based on the severity and willful nature of the violations, the division issued a retroactive revocation of TTP's authorization to pay sub-minimum wages between June 1, 2010, and January 31, 2013, during which time the company was operating in violation of the law. As a result, all FLSA-covered employees performing work for TTP during that time period are owed no less than the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour for all hours worked. TTP is allowed under the law to file a timely appeal within 60 days. Upon notification that its authorization to pay workers sub-minimum wage rates would be revoked, TTP took immediate corrective action to come into compliance with the law. The nonprofit has implemented significant changes including replacing its board of directors in its entirety, and removing or replacing the management and administrative staff who were in charge during the time period in which the violations occurred. Further, TTP has contracted with a new provider of services, Fedcap Rehabilitation Services, to assume day-to-day management of operations, hire new staff and provide proper training to ensure understanding and compliance with Section 14(c). Due to its aforementioned corrective actions, its commitment to ensure future protection of its workers and a follow-up investigation, the division has concluded that TTP can operate as a Section 14(c) certificate holder on a conditional basis until August. This allows TTP to continue to operate with little to no interruption and ensures that workers with disabilities continue to receive income, and educational and vocational training. The division will continue to closely monitor TTP's adherence to the law. TTP's vocational programs provide workers with disabilities opportunities to perform services such as product assembly and packaging, janitorial work, food processing and packaging, and other work. The Wage and Hour Division is pursuing new strategies to strengthen compliance with Section 14(c) and maximize the impact of its benefits for workers with disabilities, their employers, families and communities. These strategies include training more investigators on the provisions of the law; using all available enforcement tools to remedy and deter future violations; providing new compliance assistance materials and tools; and hosting new compliance conferences for employers, community rehabilitation programs, advocates, workers and other interested parties. The investigation was conducted by the division's district office in Hartford, Conn. Information about subminimum wage rates can be found at http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs39.pdf .

"June 13, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20130613,US Department of Labor issues compliance guidance for employee benefit plans in wake of Oklahoma tornado,"WASHINGTON – Assistant Secretary of Labor for Employee Benefits Security Phyllis C. Borzi today announced the following guidance on compliance with employee benefit plan rules for those adversely impacted by the Moore, Oklahoma tornado: The U.S. Department of Labor understands that as the practical and personal implications of the Oklahoma tornado unfold, plan fiduciaries, employers, labor organizations, service providers, participants and beneficiaries may encounter compliance-related issues over the next few months in connection with employee benefit plans covered by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The guidance provided in this statement applies to employee benefit plans, plan sponsors and service providers to such employers, located in one of the counties that have been identified as covered disaster areas because of the devastation caused by the Oklahoma tornado that occurred on May 20, 2013. Covered disaster areas are identified as federally declared disaster areas in the news releases issued by the Internal Revenue Service for victims of the Oklahoma tornado, which can be found at www.irs.gov/uac/Newsroom/IRS-Gives-Tax-Relief-To-Oklahoma-Tornado-Victims;-Return-Filing-and-Tax-Payment-Deadlines-Extended-to-Sept.-30 (link is external) . The relief provided under this announcement is in addition to the Form 5500 Annual Return/Report filing relief already provided by the IRS pursuant to news release IR-2013-53 under § 7508A of the Internal Revenue Code for victims of the Oklahoma tornado. See the regulations under § 7508A and Section 8 of Rev. Proc. 2007-56, 2007-34 I.R.B. 388. Participant Contributions and Loan Repayments In accordance with 29 CFR § 2510.3-102, amounts that a participant or beneficiary pays to an employer or amounts that a participant has withheld from his or her wages by an employer for contribution or repayment of a participant loan to an employee pension benefit plan constitute plan assets, and thereby are required to be forwarded to the plan, on the earliest date on which such amounts can reasonably be segregated from the employer’s general assets, but in no event later than the fifteenth business day of the month following the month in which the amounts were paid to or withheld by the employer. The department recognizes that there may be some employers and service providers acting on employers’ behalf, such as payroll processing services, located in covered disaster areas who will not be able to forward participant payments and withholdings to employee pension benefit plans within the prescribed timeframe. In such instances, the department will not, solely on the basis of a failure attributable to the Oklahoma tornado, seek to enforce the provisions of title I with respect to a temporary delay in forwarding such payments or contributions to an employee pension benefit plan to the extent that affected employers and service providers act reasonably, prudently and in the interest of employees to comply as soon as practicable under the circumstances. The IRS has informed the department that, subject to the foregoing conditions, it will not seek to assess an excise tax with respect to a prohibited transaction under section 4975 of the Code resulting solely from such a temporary delay. ERISA Disclosures Title I of ERISA requires various disclosures and notices to participants, beneficiaries and others by employee benefit plan administrators, fiduciaries, and others. The due dates for many of these disclosures or notices could fall within the timeframe (May 18 through Sept. 30) covered by the IRS relief including, for example, blackout notices, participant-level fee disclosures, pension benefit statements, annual funding notices and summary annual reports. The department will not seek to enforce disclosure timeliness requirements when a failure is due to events reasonably beyond the control of the plan administrator or fiduciary if they act prudently under the circumstances and comply as soon as practical. Natural disasters, by definition, are beyond the control of a plan administrator or fiduciary. ERISA Group Health Plan Compliance Guidance The department recognizes that plan participants and beneficiaries may encounter an array of problems due to the Oklahoma tornado, such as difficulties meeting certain deadlines for filing benefit claims and COBRA elections. The guiding principle for plans must be to act reasonably, prudently, and in the interest of the workers and their families, who rely on their health plans for their physical and economic well-being. Plan fiduciaries should make reasonable accommodations to prevent the loss of benefits in such cases and should take steps to minimize the possibility of individuals losing benefits because of a failure to comply with pre-established timeframes. Moreover, the department acknowledges that there may be instances when full and timely compliance by group health plans and issuers may not be possible. As stated previously, see www.dol.gov/ebsa/faqs/faq-aca.html , our approach to enforcement continues to be marked by an emphasis on compliance assistance and includes grace periods and other relief, where appropriate, including when physical disruption to a plan or service provider’s principal place of business by the Oklahoma tornado makes compliance with pre-established timeframes for certain claims decisions or disclosures impossible. Contact Information The department will continue to monitor the situation to address employee benefit plan issues that are most important in helping individuals, employers, and plan sponsors. Further guidance will be forthcoming. For more information on Oklahoma tornado relief under ERISA, contact the department's Employee Benefits Security Administration online at www.askebsa.dol.gov or by calling 1-866-444-3272.

The grantees include four states that will begin to develop their longitudinal databases (Kansas, Oregon, North Carolina and Wyoming) and two states that intend to expand work already initiated on their databases (Ohio and Virginia). Information gathered through this initiative will be used to develop tools to help users learn about the benefits of the publicly-funded workforce system. ""The grants awarded today will help improve our understanding of the workforce development system and will give consumers more information about which programs will better serve their needs"" said Gerri Fiala, acting assistant secretary for employment and training. These grants stem from the Obama administration's focus on access to high-quality data and complement the Department of Education's Statewide Longitudinal Data Systems grants to build longitudinal education databases. Grantees will be expected to achieve multiple goals during the three-year grant period. These include developing or improving state workforce longitudinal data systems with individual-level information; enabling workforce data to be matched with education data to create longitudinal data systems; improving the quality and breadth of the data in the workforce data systems; using longitudinal data to provide useful information about program operations; analyzing the performance of education and employment training programs; and providing user-friendly information to consumers, in the form of scorecards or integrated digital platforms, to help them select the training and education programs that best suit their needs. The first round of the Workforce Data Quality Initiative was awarded in November 2010 and the second round was awarded in June 2012. With today's announcement, a total of $30 million has been awarded to 29 states.

""Many farmworkers face significant barriers to stable employment, making life difficult for them and their families,"" said acting Secretary of Labor Seth D. Harris. ""Farmworkers contribute so much to the nation s economy, often through seasonal or temporary work, and the grants awarded today will open up new opportunities to find a long-term job."" The grantees announced today are expected to help farmworkers upgrade their agricultural job skills or acquire new skills in industries that offer higher wages and more stable employment. In addition, participants will receive supportive services such as transportation, nutrition, and child care, which remove barriers to farmworkers pursuing training and enable them to begin new careers. The department is also continuing grant awards, totaling $70.3 million, to National Farmworker Jobs Program grantees that performed successfully during the previous grant period. Of this amount, $64.9 million is being awarded to 45 organizations to provide career training, employment and support services. The remaining $5.38 million will be provided to 17 organizations for housing assistance grants, which helps to meet a critical need for the availability and quality of farmworker housing and supports better economic outcomes for farmworkers and their families. The National Farmworker Jobs Program is authorized by Congress in Section 167 of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, and grants are allocated through a formula that estimates the number of eligible workers in each state or territory. The grants cover a two-year period but are funded on an annual basis. The awards announced today are for July 1, 2013, through June 30, 2014. Second year allocations will be dependent on the funds available through the fiscal year 2014 appropriations process and on grantees' compliance with current and future departmental guidance.

""Former workers of SUPERVALU face a challenge in finding jobs comparable to the ones they lost,"" said acting Assistant Secretary for Employment and Training Gerri Fiala. ""The Labor Department's grant will help these individuals to update current job skills or train for a new occupation in expanding sectors of the state's economy."" Awarded to the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development, the grant will be operated by HIRED. HIRED is a workforce development organization in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area that has 16 offices to provide employment services to the community. Under the grant, affected workers will have access to dislocated worker services, such as individual career counseling, skills assessment, skill upgrades, occupational skills training and job search assistance. In March 2013, the workers at SUPERVALU received a notice under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act that about 587 workers would be affected by layoffs between May 28 and Sept. 27, 2013. SUPERVALU, one of the largest grocery wholesalers and retailers in the United States, significantly reduced the size of the company after selling several of its retail stores. The scaled-back retail operations led to layoffs of corporate headquarters staff, a majority of whom were employed in Eden Prairie.

"June 11, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20130611-0,US Labor Department sues to restore $4.9 million to pension funds of Iowa iron casting foundry and Michigan manufacturer,"LEXINGTON, Ky. – The U.S. Department of Labor has filed complaints on behalf of pension plans at Iowa-based foundry Fairfield Casting LLC and Michigan-based manufacturer Fourslides Inc. The suits, filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky, allege improper use of pension funds and seek to restore $4.9 million to the defined benefit plans. The suits follow an investigation by the department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration, which found violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, including prohibited use of plan assets for the purchase and lease of company property, prohibited purchase of customer notes from affiliated companies, prohibited transfer of assets in favor of a party-in-interest, payment of excessive fees to services providers, payment of fees on behalf of the companies, and failure to provide an updated summary plan description to participants. “Pension plans exist to help those who have worked and saved to remain secure long after they leave the workforce. Those entrusted with looking after workers’ retirement savings are held to the highest standards, and this department will hold them accountable when they violate that trust,” acting Secretary of Labor Seth D. Harris said. The lawsuits name George S. Hofmeister, trustee of the Revstone Casting Fairfield GMP Local 359 pension plan and the Fourslides plan; Robert La Courciere and Pamela Babbish, former trustees to Fourslides’ pension plan; and Bernard Tew, managing director of investment service provider Bluegrass Investment Management LLC. The suit also names Fairfield Casting LLC, formerly Revstone Casting Fairfield LLC, and Fourslides Inc., as well as Nelson Clemmons and William Tweardy, members of the Investment Committee for the Revstone Casting Fairfield plan. The suits allege that the defendants engaged in a series of prohibited transactions resulting in the use of approximately $4.9 million from the Revstone Casting Fairfield plan and the Fourslides plan. Fairfield Castings LLC took control of the Revstone plan in December 2010 and began improper use of funds from that plan just days after acquiring the assets of the plan’s former sponsor, Dexter Foundry Inc. Improper use of funds from the Fourslides plan began in March 2006 and culminated in a 2009 loan of nearly half that plan’s assets for the benefit of a party-in-interest. In its suits, the department asks the court to order the defendants to correct all prohibited transactions and restore any losses to the plans, including interest resulting from fiduciary breaches, and transfer to the plans all gains resulting from their violations of ERISA. The suits also seek to prohibit the defendants from serving as fiduciaries or service providers in the future to any plan covered by ERISA; permanently enjoin the defendants from violating ERISA, and remove them as fiduciaries of the plans. The suits call for appointment of an independent fiduciary for the plans. “Those entrusted with managing these pension funds have shown an utter disregard for the workers, who are relying on the money being there for them when they retire,” said Phyllis C. Borzi, the assistant secretary of labor who heads the Employee Benefits Security Administration. “Our aim is to make this right for those workers.” Revstone Industries LLC designs, engineers and manufactures components for use in the transportation and heavy truck industries and is located in Lexington. Revstone Industries is a related entity to both Fairfield Casting LLC and Fourslides Inc., which are owned by the Hofmeister children’s irrevocable trusts. George Hofmeister serves as the chairman of both Fairfield Castings and Fourslides. Bluegrass Investment Management LLC serves as investment advisor to the Revstone Casting Fairfield plan and the Fourslides plan, and Bernard Tew serves as managing director of Bluegrass. As trustees of the Fourslides plans, Robert La Courciere and Pamela Babbish had discretionary authority and control over the plan’s assets and participated in the decisions related to the alleged improper asset transfers and fee payments of that plan, according to the suits. William Tweardy and Nelson Clemmons, members of the Investment Committee for the Revstone Casting Fairfield plan along with Hofmeister, had discretionary authority and control over the plan’s assets and participated in the decisions related to the alleged improper investments of that plan, according to the suits. This case was investigated by EBSA’s Cincinnati Regional Office. It is being litigated by the department’s Cleveland Regional Solicitor’s Office.

Losik to restore $225, 274 to the Losik Engineering Design Group Ltd. defined benefit retirement plan. Losik, the company’s president and owner, violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act by imprudently investing plan assets in a hedge fund, by making an improper distribution to his own account, and by failing to properly administer the plan. The judgment resolves a lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Labor based on findings of an investigation by the department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration. “The department is committed to holding accountable those who are entrusted with the assets of workers’ retirement plans,” said Steve Haugen, director of EBSA’s Chicago Regional Office, which conducted the investigation. “We will continue to help workers obtain their rightful benefits when plan fiduciaries violate the law.” Under the terms of the consent order and judgment, Losik is liable to the plan for $225, 274—the amount he distributed to himself in 2008. He is barred from serving as a fiduciary or service provider to any employee benefit plan subject to ERISA in the future. Additionally, the court appointed an independent fiduciary to liquidate the plan’s approximate $250,000 investment in a high-risk hedge fund that Losik authorized in 2007 and which now represents 100 percent of the plan’s assets.

"June 7, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20130607,Statement of acting Labor Secretary Seth D. Harris on May employment numbers,"WASHINGTON – Acting Secretary of Labor Seth D. Harris issued the following statement about the May 2013 Employment Situation report released today: ""This morning's report offers more encouraging evidence that the U.S. economy continues to rebound at a steady, moderate rate – a total of 178,000 new private sector jobs in May. That makes 39 months in a row of growth – in just over three years, the economy has now generated just shy of 7 million jobs. ""Professional and business services (+57,000), leisure and hospitality (+43,000) and retail trade (+28,000) all enjoyed surges in May. The unemployment rate (7.6 percent) remained essentially unchanged, the ninth consecutive month that it has been below 8 percent. The increase in the civilian labor force of 420,000 (the highest increase since last October), together with higher consumer confidence, suggests that Americans are increasingly bullish about the nation's economic future. ""The economy is clearly recovering, but not as rapidly or robustly as it can and must. There are still too many hard-working men and women who can't find jobs, too many families struggling to secure their place in the middle class. ""The president's budget offers a path to a more accelerated recovery. The president has put forward a plan that invests responsibly in job-creating initiatives, while reducing the deficit by $1.1 trillion over the next decade, according to a Congressional Budget Office analysis. Now is not the time for short-sighted, irresponsible austerity measures. ""The president has proposed several infrastructure investments that will put more people back to work in construction and other industries. His aggressive manufacturing innovation agenda will provide a shot in the arm to a sector that has now experienced a three-month jobs decline. Fixing our broken immigration system, so that everyone plays by the same rules and pays their fair share, is also part of the solution. CBO has estimated that comprehensive immigration reform could increase GDP by as much as 1.3 percent, while contributing to deficit reduction. ""Education remains critical to long-term economic growth, as a skilled workforce increases productivity and becomes a magnet drawing jobs to our shores. The Department of Education recently reported that high school graduation has reached a 35-year high, with increases across all racial and ethnic groups. But we need to do more to ensure that promising young people aren't priced out of a college education or saddled with crippling debt just to get the schooling they need."""

The grantees will emphasize skills development in high-demand industries and occupations available within their local communities. The four grantees are expected to serve approximately 4,100 youth in 31 communities across the country. The remaining eight grants total nearly $12 million and will serve youths and adults who demonstrate characteristics most common to female former offenders. The goal of these grants is to provide employment-focused services and support to help participants overcome traumas like physical and sexual abuse, family turmoil, mental health and substance abuse and other barriers to successful reintegration to society. Grantees must use an integrated strategy that includes empowerment and self-development, workforce development, and education. While female ex-offenders are the focus of these grants, the grants may serve male ex-offenders as well.

""Senator Lautenberg was a successful businessman who never forgot what it was like to grow up poor in Paterson. He was a proud World War II veteran who was dedicated to helping our returning heroes as the GI Bill had helped him. He was a self-made success who believed in the importance of giving back through public service. His leadership on anti-smoking efforts and transportation safety unquestionably saved lives.

"June 3, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20130603-0,US Department of Labor encourages asset custodians and record-keepers to work together to wind up abandoned plans,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Labor's Employee Benefits Security Administration today announced that it has approved a process for JP Morgan Chase Bank NA and ADP Inc. to terminate and wind up approximately 180 defined contribution pension plans abandoned due to corporate crises or neglect. This action, conducted through EBSA's abandoned plan program, will give plan participants control over the fate of their retirement savings. ""The abandoned plan program provides a streamlined process for efficiently winding up abandoned plans,"" said Assistant Secretary for Employee Benefits Security Phyllis C. Borzi. ""The alliance between JP Morgan and ADP is an excellent example of how custodians and record keepers can team up to terminate abandoned plans and help workers, and we encourage others to do the same."" When employers abandon their individual account pension plans, custodians such as banks, insurers and mutual fund companies are left holding the assets of these abandoned plans but without the authority to terminate such plans and make benefit distributions — even in response to participant demands. EBSA developed the abandoned plan program to facilitate a voluntary, safe and efficient process for winding up the affairs of abandoned individual account plans so that benefit distributions are made to participants and beneficiaries. According to papers filed with the department, one company, Emergent Business Services LLC, abandoned its defined contribution pension plan in 2006, and plan participants found themselves unable to access the benefits they had earned. But the alliance between JP Morgan and ADP means the participants in this and other plans will soon have control over the fate of their retirement savings. JP Morgan, the plan's asset custodian, elected to serve as the ""qualified termination administrator"" under the program, and chose ADP, the plan's record-keeper, to carry out the activities necessary to terminate and wind up the plan. ADP, as agent, filed the necessary papers with the department on behalf of JP Morgan. In addition to the Emergent Business Services plan, JP Morgan and ADP have elected to terminate and wind up approximately 180 other abandoned plans under the program, affecting approximately 690 plan participants and beneficiaries and involving almost $3 million in assets. A pension plan generally is considered abandoned under the abandoned plan program if 12 consecutive months pass in which no contributions to or distributions from the plan are made, and if a qualified termination administrator determines that the sponsor no longer exists, cannot be located or is otherwise unable to maintain the plan. To date, almost $75 million in distributions have been made under the program. More information on the abandoned plan program is available at www.dol.gov/ebsa/compliance_assistance.html#section9"

"May 30, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20130530,MSHA announces results of April impact inspections,"ARLINGTON, Va. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration today announced that federal inspectors issued 106 citations, 13 orders and one safeguard during special impact inspections conducted at nine coal mines and two metal/nonmetal mines last month. The monthly inspections, which began in force in April 2010 following the explosion at the Upper Big Branch Mine, involve mines that merit increased agency attention and enforcement due to their poor compliance history or particular compliance concerns. These matters include high numbers of violations or closure orders; frequent hazard complaints or hotline calls; plan compliance issues; inadequate workplace examinations; a high number of accidents, injuries or illnesses; fatalities; adverse conditions such as increased methane liberation, faulty roof conditions and inadequate ventilation; and respirable dust. As an example from last month, MSHA conducted an impact inspection April 17 at Fork Creek No. 1 Mine, Coal River Mining, LLC in Lincoln County, W.Va., covering extensive areas of the mine and issuing four closure orders and 10 citations. The mine was cited for inadequate examination of one of the conveyer belts where hazardous conditions existed inspectors found that top-structure rollers were not immediately removed or repaired on the belt during the examination. Although maintenance shift records showed that two sections of the top structure of the belt needed replacement, the hazardous conditions were not recorded in the official examination book. Inspectors also found a broken inner support bracket, the canister roller turned on the structure frame, and a groove worn into the frame that was hot to the touch. Inspectors found 31 locations where belt strings (cords) intertwined with the belt roller and hanger. This creates a potential fire and smoke inhalation hazard. Among other violations cited, inspectors found that the mine operator failed to follow the MSHA-approved methane/dust control plan for the roof bolter. Without proper ventilation to dilute the air and carry away dust and harmful gases, miners are exposed to respiratory hazards that increase their risk of developing black lung, silicosis and other respiratory diseases. Power cables on a shuttle car operating in a wet area of the mine were not properly maintained and posed an electrocution hazard. The cable insulation was damaged and not repaired to prevent moisture from entering the conductor. This was the second impact inspection at Fork Creek No. 1. In February, the mine was issued 16 ventilation violations, 13 of which were closure orders for the operator's unwarrantable failure to comply with health and safety standards, including serious violations of its ventilation plan. ""This latest inspection is an example of a mine that still doesn't get it,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""The violations that were issued show the troublesome behavior that takes place at some mines when MSHA inspectors are not expected to show up."" Since April 2010, MSHA has conducted 602 impact inspections and issued 10,297 citations, 961 orders and 44 safeguards. View the spreadsheet (PDF)"

The final rules support workplace health promotion and prevention as a means to reduce the burden of chronic illness, improve health and limit growth of health care costs, while ensuring that individuals are protected from unfair underwriting practices that could otherwise reduce benefits based on health status. The final rules continue to support participatory wellness programs, which generally are available without regard to an individual's health status. These include programs that reimburse for the cost of membership in a fitness center; that provide a reward to employees for attending a monthly, no-cost health education seminar; or that reward employees who complete a health risk assessment, without requiring them to take further action. The rules also outline standards for nondiscriminatory health-contingent wellness programs, which generally reward individuals who meet a specific standard related to their health. Examples of health-contingent wellness programs include programs that provide a reward to those who do not use, or decrease their use of, tobacco, or programs that reward those who achieve a specified health-related goal, such as a specified cholesterol level, weight, or body mass index, as well as those who fail to meet such goals but take certain other healthy actions. Today's final rules ensure flexibility for employers by increasing the maximum reward that may be offered under appropriately designed wellness programs, including outcome-based programs. The final rules also protect consumers by requiring that health-contingent wellness programs be reasonably designed, are uniformly available to all similarly situated individuals and accommodate recommendations made at any time by an individual's physician, based on medical appropriateness. The final rules will be effective for plan years beginning on or after Jan. 1, 2014. The rule was issued May 29. To view the final rules, visit http://www.dol.gov/ebsa .

But because I had people in my life who instilled in me an expectation of work and showed me opportunities to be successful, I completed college and became known for what I can do,"" said Kathy Martinez, assistant secretary of labor for disability employment policy. ""I urge all employers to benefit from the skills of workers with disabilities by giving them, including our returning veterans, a chance to show that they, too, are equal to the task.""

Conducted in collaboration with business and disability organizations, the campaign emphasizes that, at work, it is what people can do that matters. More information about the Campaign for Disability Employment is available at http://www.whatcanyoudocampaign.org. Recognized in some form since 1945 when Congress designated a week in October as ""National Employ the Physically Handicapped Week,"" National Disability Employment Awareness Month is a culmination of ODEP's year-long efforts to raise awareness about the value of employing people with disabilities. The theme is announced well in advance of October to enable communities throughout the nation to plan announcements and activities to recognize the month and celebrate the many and varied contributions of America's workers with disabilities. Such activities include proclamations, public awareness programs and job fairs that enhance awareness, create opportunities, or showcase the abilities and talents of workers with disabilities.

The settlement agreement also provided that the department could file a consent judgment if it determined that Kalucha failed to remit the funds due to the plan by April 30, 2013. Kalucha failed to do so. Resolution: The U.S. Department of Labor filed a complaint on May 21, 2013, and the court entered a consent judgment on May 22, 2013, ordering Kalucha to restore plan losses and interest totaling $20,834.08 to the company’s 401(k) employee benefit plan.

Hardy Construction Co. of Syracuse. The 401(k) plan was established in July 1992. The company closed its doors in June 2008, and all its assets were sold at bank auction in August 2008. David Hardy, the plan’s sole trustee, filed for bankruptcy in January 2010. Since 2008, no individual has come forth to assume fiduciary responsibility for the plan or to distribute the plan’s assets to its participants. Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, plans must be managed by fiduciaries and their assets held in trust by trustees. In the absence of a plan fiduciary and trustee, participants and beneficiaries cannot obtain plan information, make investments or collect retirement benefits. In this case, the David J. Hardy Construction 401(k) plan has 19 participants and more than $270,000 in assets. The department’s lawsuit asks the court to appoint an independent fiduciary and trustee to administer the plan and distribute its assets to plan participants and beneficiaries. “When a 401(k) plan is abandoned by its fiduciaries, the plan’s participants are deserted as well, unable to access the funds that rightly belong to them,” said Susan Hensley, regional director for the department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration in Boston. “We are here to help these workers. We want them to know that they can turn to the department for assistance when they find themselves locked out of access to their retirement plan.” This suit resulted from an investigation conducted by EBSA’s Boston Regional Office. The case is being litigated by the department’s regional solicitor in New York.

Thousands of children work in Colombia's mining sector, where they labor alongside adults and are exposed to physical injuries, dangerous tools, hazardous substances, toxic gases and explosions. Many people are not aware that children face these hazards. One or more qualifying organizations will receive funding to support Colombia's efforts to identify and combat child labor in the mining sector, including by increasing educational opportunities for children and improving the livelihoods of families involved in artisanal mining. The project(s) will address occupational safety concerns to reduce the risk of injuries to adult miners and the corresponding loss of household income that can contribute to child labor. In addition, the project(s) will improve interagency coordination to provide social services to children engaged in mining and fund an exchange program with other countries to share strategies on activities covered by the grant(s). Applications must be submitted by July 19 at 5 p.m. EDT electronically via http://www.grants.gov or as hard copies mailed to the U.S. Department of Labor, Office of Procurement Services, 200 Constitution Ave. NW, Room S-4307, Washington, DC 20210, Attention: Brenda White.

"May 20, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20130520,"Putnam County Board of Education agrees to organization-wide FMLA compliance, resolving US Labor Department lawsuit","Consent judgment also includes order to pay $50,000 in lost wages to former employee WINFIELD, W.Va. — The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia has approved a consent judgment ordering the Putnam County Board of Education in Winfield to pay $50,000 in back wages to a former employee to resolve a lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Labor alleging violations of the Family and Medical Leave Act. The judgment also orders the defendants to implement several specific measures to ensure future compliance with the FMLA. The department filed suit following an investigation by its Wage and Hour Division that found the school board unlawfully had terminated the employee, who worked as a maintenance electrician, when he asked to take time off to care for a parent with a serious health condition. Investigators found that the school board retaliated against the employee for requesting leave that was FMLA-protected when it first attempted to force him to resign and then ultimately terminated his employment. The school board had failed to provide the employee with any of the required FMLA notices about his rights under the law. This failure prevented him from asserting his FMLA rights and hindered his ability to make an educated decision about requesting leave. Also, the school board did not post any notice of employees' rights under the FMLA in conspicuous places as required by law and failed to include adequate information notifying all employees of FMLA leave protections in its employee handbook. ""Today's judgment provides peace of mind for Putnam County Board of Education employees and their families who rely on the FMLA's critical workplace flexibility protections,"" said Mary Beth Maxwell, acting deputy administrator of the Wage and Hour Division. ""This case demonstrates the Labor Department's commitment to ensuring that employees are not retaliated against or prevented from exercising their FMLA rights. The school board has agreed to some significant compliance assurance measures. We encourage other employers to adopt similar proactive approaches to educating their workforces about the FMLA and ensuring sustained compliance with the law."" Pursuant to the court-approved consent judgment, the school board has agreed to implement a number of measures in order to prevent future violations of the FMLA. These measures include designating (a) manager(s) who will be responsible for ensuring proper administration of the FMLA; posting the official FMLA poster in conspicuous places so employees in all schools within the Putnam County Board of Education system can see it; training managers and supervisors on FMLA rules and requirements, and providing the Labor Department with notice of completion of all such trainings; and providing all personnel a written FMLA handbook explaining the employer's and employees' rights and responsibilities under the act. Additionally, the school board must review all denied requests for employee leave for the 2012-2013 school year to ensure that it did not interfere with, restrain or deny the exercise of any right provided under the FMLA, and remedy any FMLA-related errors found to include restoring any affected employee to the leave, pay and employment position he or she would have occupied had the FMLA-related error not occurred. The school board must conduct a similar review and provide all appropriate remedies to any current or former employees who allege within the next six months that they were not afforded their rights under the FMLA at any time during the two-year period prior to the consent judgment. The FMLA allows eligible employees to take unpaid leave to bond with a newborn, newly adopted or newly placed child, for their own serious health condition, or to care for a seriously ill child, spouse or parent, without fear of losing their jobs and with continuation of health care coverage under the same terms and conditions as if the employee had not taken leave. FMLA leave may also be taken for specified reasons related to certain military deployments and to care for a covered service member with a serious injury or illness. An employer is prohibited from interfering with, restraining, or denying the exercise of, or the attempt to exercise, an FMLA right. Prohibited conduct includes refusal to authorize FMLA leave for an eligible employee. Current and former employees who worked for the Putnam County Board of Education system and believe that they were denied the exercise of any right provided under FMLA during the past two years should contact the school system at 304-586-0500 or the Wage and Hour Division's area office in Charleston, W.Va., at 304-347-5206. The Labor Department's regional solicitor office in Philadelphia negotiated the resolution of this case.

"May 16, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20130516,Temporary reinstatement victory for California miner,"Mine owner initially refused to comply with judge's order ARLINGTON, Va. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration today announced that a miner fired from his job at a California rare earth minerals operation when he spoke out about unsafe working conditions has been temporarily reinstated. An administrative law judge with the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission issued a decision April 17 requiring the immediate reinstatement of the miner at the Mt. Pass Mine and Mill in Mountain Pass, Calif. Initially, the mine operator, C.R. Meyer and Sons Co., did not comply with the judge's order. On April 23, C.R. Meyer and Sons filed a motion to stay the judge's order and a petition for review of the decision with the commission. On April 24, Labor Department attorneys filed in federal district court an application for a temporary restraining order to enjoin the company from violating the reinstatement order, as well as an opposition with the commission to the company's motion, and requested an immediate decision on the operator's motion for stay. On April 26, after the commission denied its motion to stay, the mine operator agreed to reinstate the miner to his job as a foreman retroactive to the date of the reinstatement order. On May 10, the commission remanded the case for the administrative law judge to consider evidence he had excluded in the temporary reinstatement hearing but reiterated in its opinion that ""the miner remains reinstated under the terms of the judge's original decision."" The miner, who spoke out about various safety issues at the mine, had refused to work on a sodium carbonate tank until the operator provided him with a material safety data sheet so he would know what to do in the event of overexposure. The miner also wanted to know what type of personal protective equipment to use when handling the chemical substance. In addition, he refused to tie off on a vertical scaffolding pole for protection from falling rather than on a designated tie-off point, as required by MSHA, and made those complaints directly to management. The following day, he was terminated. Mine management told the miner he was laid off for ""standing around"" on different projects. Section 105(c) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 protects miners, their representatives and applicants for employment from retaliation for engaging in safety and/or health-related activities such as identifying hazards, asking for MSHA inspections or refusing to engage in an unsafe act. ""MSHA urges miners to exercise their rights, and actively participate in monitoring safety and health conditions,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""Operators need to comply with temporary reinstatement orders while the legal process goes forward."" The miner has been receiving economic reinstatement and returned to full-time work on May 6 as a foreman."
"May 16, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20130516,"Rigid Oil Field Services in Hydro, Okla., pays more than $51,000 in overtime back wages following US Labor Department investigation","HYDRO, Okla. — Rigid Oil Field Services LLC has agreed to pay $51,839 in overtime back wages to 28 current and former employees following an investigation by the U.S. Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division, which found violations of the overtime and record-keeping provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act. The company misclassified its employees as independent contractors. The investigation by the division's Oklahoma City District Office determined that laborers at Rigid Oil Field Services LLC were employees and not independent contractors as the company claimed. As a result of this misclassification, the company violated the FLSA by failing to pay its employees the legally required overtime pay for hours worked in excess of 40 in a workweek. Additionally, Rigid Oil Services LLC failed to maintain hours worked and payroll records for the employees that were misclassified as independent contractors. ""The misclassification of employees as independent contractors presents one of the most serious problems facing affected employees, employers and the entire economy,"" said Cynthia Watson, regional administrator for the Wage and Hour Division in the Southwest Region. ""The workers were not only denied their proper overtime compensation, but they were cheated out of other required worker protections, such as unemployment insurance and workers' compensation."" The company has agreed to comply with the FLSA in the future and has secured a third party to help it ensure that employees received time and one-half their regular rate of pay for hours worked over 40 in a week. The employer also agreed to pay the back wages found due in full. Too often, business models and practices result in employees being misclassified as something other than an employee, such as independent contractors or LLCs. Under the law, however, whether someone is an employee is determined by the actual relationship between the worker and the business — not by label or registration. Similarly, simply providing employees with 1099s instead of W-2s does not transform them into legitimate independent contractors under the FLSA. Misclassifying employees can result in workers being denied minimum wage, overtime pay, unemployment insurance and workers' compensation benefits. This makes it harder for low-wage workers to put food on the table and provide for their families. It means a greater chance of working in unsafe conditions and not being compensated when hurt on the job. The FLSA requires that covered, nonexempt employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour for all hours worked, plus time and one-half their regular rates, including commissions, bonuses, piece-rate earnings and incentive pay, for hours worked beyond 40 per week. In general, hours worked includes all time an employee must be on duty, or on the employer's premises or at any other prescribed place of work, from the beginning of the first principal work activity to the end of the last principal activity of the workday. Additionally, the law requires that accurate records of employees' wages, hours and other conditions of employment be maintained.

"May 9, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20130509,Vermont and Utah Job Corps students combine skills to create awards honoring service of US Labor Department employees,"WASHINGTON – Job Corps students and instructors from Vermont and Utah used recycling and sustainability in creating unique, handcrafted awards honoring the service and dedication of U.S. Department of Labor employees who are recipients of the 2013 Secretary of Labor's Honor Awards. Annual Honor Awards represent the highest level of recognition used to acknowledge employees whose work and accomplishments achieved an outstanding level and demonstrated excellence in promoting the department's mission in goals set under the leadership of acting Secretary Seth D. Harris. This year's theme is ""Then, Now, Next,"" symbolizing the 100 years that the U.S. Department of Labor has unwaveringly promoted the welfare of working Americans. Job Corps centers competed to design this year's award. The winning design is an aluminum medallion hung from a metal ""C"" hook embedded into a wooden base with a matching centennial face plate affixed. In a ceremony today, scores of Labor Department employees received awards in recognition of their exceptional efforts and outstanding displays of professionalism, teamwork and dedication. Issues ranged from preparing veterans to find good jobs and protecting the rights and wages of vulnerable workers to ensuring the security of retirement benefits and improving highway worker zone safety. The department honored employees from numerous agencies, including the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Employee Benefits Security Administration, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Office of Disability Employment Policy, the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Policy, the Office of the Chief Financial Officer, the Veterans' Employment and Training Service, the Wage and Hour Division, the Women's Bureau, the Office of the Solicitor, the Mine Safety and Health Administration, the Bureau of International Labor Affairs, the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs, the Employment and Training Administration, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration and Management, the Office of Inspector General, the Office of Labor-Management Standards and the Office of Public Affairs. ETA's Job Corps is the nation's largest career technical training and education program for students ages 16 through 24. The program serves approximately 60,000 young people each year at 125 centers in 48 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Northlands Job Corps, Vergennes, Vt. Under the direction of welding instructor Jim Blanchard, a Navy veteran, students from four Career Technical Training Programs welding, carpentry, urban forestry and auto collision decided to use recycled products from the past, present and the future (Then, Now, Next) for their creation. Northlands Urban Forestry students, led by arborist instructors Jeremy Riemersma and David Gross and carpentry instructor Todd Lossman, removed several sustainably harvested brown maple trees from the Rokeby Museum property in Ferrisburgh, Vt. Students and instructors worked with cutting the lumber into wooden bases, which were sanded and finished. Then students under the direction of welding instructor Tony Bosnich cut recycled pipe and used a plasma cutter and a gas tungsten arc welding process to produce the hook from which a medallion would be hung. After the assembly of the pieces, auto body instructor Sidney Messick and his students prepared the surfaces and used a spray paint coating for the finished product. Past: harvested wood and reclaimed pipe Present: welding, cutting and painting utilizing materials available Future: developing skills for future craftsmen Northland Job Corps students Dylan Vose, Victoria Finley, Omar Hutchinson, Timothy Hamlin, Marquis Benjamin, Samantha Burgess, Muhamud Jeilani, Daniel Quick, Jason Hubbard and Sage Gratton participated. Clearfield Job Corps, Clearfield, Utah Machining instructor David Howell assigned his students to create the medallion and centennial face plate using Feature Cam software. Once the design was approved, the students made a draft of the medallion and centennial face plate on a HASS CNC mill using both bronze and aluminum materials. Then students, under the supervision of welding instructors Roger Holcomb and Glenn Stott, used an Adira metal sheer to rough cut the scores of medallions and face plates into manageable pieces that were shaped, milled and given a hole at the top for display hanging. Clearfield Job Corps students Justin Blenheim and Alexander Galindo participated."
"May 8, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20130508,"MSHA, New Elk Coal reach settlement","Miner who filed discrimination complaint to receive $115,000 ARLINGTON, Va. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration today announced that New Elk Coal Co. has agreed to pay approximately $115,000 to a miner whose employment was terminated shortly after he filed a hazard complaint. The company also has agreed to pay MSHA a civil penalty of $10,000. In April 2012, an electrician working at the New Elk Mine in Trinidad, Colo., contacted MSHA about hazardous conditions along a beltline that he claimed were not being properly addressed by his supervisors. The day after he filed the complaint, MSHA issued several citations to the mine. His position and shift changed multiple times over the next three weeks and, on May 12, he was terminated. One month later, the miner filed a complaint of discrimination with MSHA, alleging that he had been fired for notifying the agency of the mine's hazardous conditions. In a complaint filed with the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission, MSHA sought a finding that New Elk Coal Co. unlawfully had discriminated against the employee in violation of Section 105(c) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. The statute protects miners, their representatives and applicants for employment from retaliation for engaging in safety and/or health-related activities such as identifying hazards, asking for MSHA inspections or refusing to engage in an unsafe act. An administrative law judge ordered during an August 2012 hearing that the miner be temporarily reinstated. However, based on an agreement by the parties, the miner received approximately seven months of pay in lieu of returning to work. Prior to a scheduled hearing on the merits of the miner's discrimination claim, the parties settled the case, with New Elk Mining Co. agreeing to compensate him for an additional 10 months of pay. In a separate case last January, the parties reached agreement that resolved a claim of discriminatory termination of a supervisor at the same mine. In that case, too, New Elk agreed to pay a civil penalty of $10,000 to MSHA, plus approximately $88,000 to the terminated employee. Additionally, the company agreed to provide company-wide training regarding miners' rights. ""All miners, supervisors and contractors have the right to identify hazardous conditions and refuse unsafe work without fear of discrimination or retaliation,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""They also have the right to be trained in the health and safety aspects of tasks, including recognizing hazards at the mine and the proper procedures for reporting those hazards."" Working with the Labor Department's Office of the Solicitor, MSHA filed 46 temporary reinstatement requests and 34 105(c) discrimination cases on behalf of miners in 2012, the most ever in a year."
"May 8, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20130508,US Labor Departments Wage and Hour Division and SUBWAY franchisor collaborate to boost restaurants compliance with federal labor laws,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division and the franchisor of the world's largest restaurant chain are collaborating to increase compliance with federal labor laws at SUBWAY locations nationwide. Although these restaurants are independently owned and operated, the franchisor is providing a forum and resources to assist the division in educating franchisees. ""The SUBWAY chain has embraced the opportunity to work with the Wage and Hour Division,"" said acting Secretary of Labor Seth D. Harris. ""Too often, franchisors ignore compliance issues among their independently owned franchised locations. This company's efforts illustrate both a commitment to the integrity of its brand and to the well-being of SUBWAY restaurant employees nationwide."" The franchisor has placed a link to the Wage and Hour Division's website on its intranet site for restaurant owners to reference, amended several of its governing documents and provided numerous other resources to help franchisees comply with labor laws. Additionally, the franchisor has agreed to enforce its rights under the franchise contract if it becomes aware of a legal disposition that a franchisee knowingly violated a federal labor law. This agreement should elevate Fair Labor Standards Act compliance to a new level of priority among franchisees. SUBWAY headquarters is committed to facilitating a means for the Wage and Hour Division to educate franchisees on wage and hour laws. The division's emphasis on outreach and employer education will play a major role in this collaboration. SUBWAY headquarters has invited division staff to present at several of its annual meetings, published a series of articles authored by the division in its weekly electronic newsletter outlining federal minimum wage and overtime requirements under the FLSA and facilitated the division's efforts to provide FLSA posters to all new SUBWAY franchise owners. Also, division staff provided FLSA training materials to the SUBWAY headquarters corporate training department; trainers are now able to share these materials with each new class. ""We encourage other franchisors to take similar measures to ensure compliance among their franchisees,"" said Mary Beth Maxwell, acting deputy administrator of the Wage and Hour Division. ""It just makes good business sense. Employers found in violation often must pay not only back wages but damages and penalties. The good faith efforts shown by the SUBWAY franchisor benefit the employees of franchisees, the franchisees themselves and the economy as a whole. When everyone competes on a level playing field, everyone wins."" The FLSA requires that covered, nonexempt employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour as well as time and one-half their regular rates for every hour they work beyond 40 per week. The law further requires employers to maintain accurate records of employees' wages, hours and other conditions of employment, and establishes a minimum age of 18 for workers in those nonagricultural occupations that the secretary of labor finds and declares to be particularly hazardous for 16- and 17-year-old workers or detrimental to their health or well-being. The FLSA also prohibits employers from retaliating against employees who exercise their rights under the law.

During the course of an investigation by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Employee Benefits Security Administration, the agency found that from April 2008 to September 2008, First Restoration and Frank Headen failed in their fiduciary responsibility to forward $27,637 in employee contributions to the First Restoration Services Inc. 401(k) retirement plan in a timely manner and also allowed the funds to be commingled with general company assets and to be used for company purposes and obligations rather than for the exclusive benefit of the plan. Resolution: The defendants have restored all contributions owed to the plan, including interest or lost opportunity costs, with the exception of contributions and lost earnings owed to Headen. The order requires the defendants to take all necessary and appropriate steps to terminate the plan and distribute the assets to participants and beneficiaries no later than June 1, 2013. If the defendants are unable or unwilling to complete the termination and distribution by the time specified, the secretary of labor may seek the appointment of an independent fiduciary to the plan for the purpose of terminating the plan and distributing the plan’s assets.

The settlement involves 39 citations and orders issued in the wake of the accident and during subsequent mine inspections. U.S. Lime also has agreed to accept a flagrant violation of Section 57.12016 of the Code of Federal Regulations, which requires electrically powered equipment to be de-energized before any mechanical work is performed. That single penalty was assessed by MSHA at $150,600. According to MSHA's accident investigation report, Wilbur A. Farris was fatally injured while in a roller mill that was not properly locked out and de-energized. The roller mill started while Farris was inside. Investigators found that the linkage from the breaker box handle to the electrical circuit breaker for the lower portion of the vertical roller mill was missing and, consequently, moving the handle to the ""off"" position did not de-energize the power. They determined that management engaged in aggravated conduct constituting more than ordinary negligence in that two supervisors were present at the time of the accident. ""As I've often stated, mine fatalities are preventable,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""This accident occurred because mine management failed to ensure that safe work procedures were being followed while performing maintenance and mechanical work in the roller mill."""
"May 7, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ilab/ilab20130507,United States seeks to protect worker rights under US-Bahrain trade agreement,"WASHINGTON — Acting Secretary of Labor Seth D. Harris and acting U.S. Trade Representative Demetrios Marantis today announced that the United States has requested consultations with the Government of the Kingdom of Bahrain under the Labor Chapter of the United States — Bahrain Free Trade Agreement. The request follows a December 2012 report by the U.S. Department of Labor that highlighted labor issues stemming from the Government of Bahrain's response to civil unrest in early 2011 in Bahrain and recommended actions to address those issues. The report is available at http://www.dol.gov/ilab/programs/otla/20121220Bahrain.pdf. ""Our sincere hope is that these consultations will produce a concrete plan of action, based on the recommendations in the Labor Department's report, which will strengthen labor protections in Bahrain and help prevent future violations of workers' rights,"" said acting Secretary Harris. ""Ensuring that workers in Bahrain — and in other countries — can exercise their fundamental labor rights is a top priority for the Obama administration, and we expect that the action we are taking today will produce a collaborative discussion and positive resolution to these important labor issues,"" said Ambassador Marantis. ""We look forward to working with Bahrain to improve respect for labor rights through the mechanisms provided by our trade agreement."" The United States is seeking consultations to discuss actions taken by Bahrain that appear to be inconsistent with the Labor Chapter of the FTA. Specifically, the Labor Department's report details the apparent targeting of trade unionists and leaders for firing after a general strike in March 2011, employment discrimination based on religious (sectarian) identity or political opinion, and labor laws that do not provide adequate protection on these issues. The report recognizes that the Bahraini government, in particular the minister of labor, has taken important steps to address labor concerns following the unrest in 2011 by seeking the reinstatement of fired workers, but finds that problems remain with Bahraini labor laws as well as the treatment of certain reinstated workers. A copy of the letter is available at http://www.ustr.gov/sites/dolgov/files/legacy-files/05072013%20Bahrain%20labor%20consultations%20request.pdf . Background The U.S. Department of Labor issued the report on Dec. 20, 2012, in response to a submission filed by the American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations regarding the Government of Bahrain's commitments under the Labor Chapter of the United States-Bahrain FTA. The AFL-CIO submission alleged that Bahrain had acted inconsistently with its labor obligations under the FTA in its response to civil unrest and national strikes in early 2011. The Labor Department's report found that, although the Government of Bahrain has taken important steps to address some of the labor issues arising from the 2011 unrest, including actions by the minister of labor to seek reinstatement of most of the workers fired, the United States should request FTA labor consultations to develop a plan with Bahrain to address remaining concerns. The FTA Labor Chapter stipulates that consultations shall commence within 30 days of a written request from either party to the trade agreement, unless both parties agree otherwise."

The U.S. departments of Labor, Education, and Health and Human Services and the Social Security Administration will host the event May 13-27, and they invite policymakers, service providers, the advocacy community and others to join this conversation to improve transition outcomes. Youths and young adults with disabilities face unique challenges that may complicate their educational achievements as well as their plans for school, training and work. As a result, they may have poorer educational and employment outcomes than their peers without disabilities and fail to achieve the maximum independence possible. ""We must ensure that our federal programs and resources support our nation's youths and young adults with disabilities in reaching their dreams of economic empowerment and independence, and we need to hear from many people,"" said Kathy Martinez, assistant secretary of labor for disability employment policy.

"May 6, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20130506,Major staffing agency Hutco to pay nearly $2 million in overtime back wages to workers following US Labor Department investigation,"BROUSSARD, La . — Hutco Inc., a major industrial services employment agency, has agreed to pay $1,916,850 in back wages to 2,267 employees assigned to client work sites throughout Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. An investigation conducted by the U.S. Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division found that the company utilized improper pay and record-keeping practices that resulted in employees being denied overtime compensation in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act. ""Employers cannot avoid their legal responsibility to pay overtime by using evasive practices that seek to undermine labor laws and deny workers their rightful wages,"" said acting Secretary of Labor Seth D. Harris. ""As a result of our investigation, not only is nearly $2 million in unpaid wages going into the pockets of the workers who earned it, but today's agreement will also ensure the company's future compliance with the FLSA."" ""Temporary employment arrangements can make the worker-employer relationship difficult for workers to understand,"" said Mary Beth Maxwell, acting deputy administrator of the Wage and Hour Division. ""As a result, temporary workers face the risk of not being treated as employees in terms of the wages and legal protections guaranteed under federal law. The Wage and Hour Division is committed to protecting them, and continues to reach out to stakeholders and state agencies to help ensure that employers who utilize contingent work arrangements do so in compliance with all applicable laws."" An investigation of the company's headquarters in Lafayette disclosed systemic overtime violations throughout six branch establishments. Hutco mischaracterized certain wages as ""per diem"" payments and impermissibly excluded these wages when calculating overtime premiums, thus denying employees earned overtime compensation. This improper pay practice also resulted in FLSA record-keeping violations involving the accuracy of employees' wages and actual hours worked. Under the settlement, in addition to paying back wages, Hutco has committed to future compliance with the law. The agreement includes specific measures the company will take to prevent future violations, including setting standards to accurately identify and compensate workers who qualify for bona fide per diem payments, paying accurate overtime and ensuring per diem payments are not automatically excluded from overtime calculations, informing employees about their pay and employment conditions, and obtaining written acknowledgment from employees that they understand the criteria for receipt of per diem payments. Additionally, Hutco must maintain accurate records demonstrating which employees received bona fide per diem payments and that such payments are based on applicable Internal Revenue Service guidelines, or upon a reasonable approximation of the expenses incurred. The FLSA requires that covered employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour for all hours worked, plus time and one-half their regular rates, including commissions, bonuses and incentive pay, for hours worked beyond 40 per week. Employers must also maintain accurate time and payroll records. An employee's regular pay rate, upon which overtime must be computed, includes all wages for employment, except certain payments excluded by the FLSA, such as reimbursements for work-related expenses. Payments reasonably approximating travel or other expenses incurred on the employer's behalf may be excluded from the employee's regular rate of pay when computing overtime. However, where an employee receives such payments but actually incurs no such additional expenses, such payments do not constitute bona fide reimbursements and must be included in the employee's regular rate of pay for purposes of computing an overtime premium. Hutco Inc. is a labor services company that provides skilled and unskilled labor to clients throughout the United States in industries such as vessel construction, oil field fabrication, warehousing and distribution, manufacturing and other industries. The employees entitled to receive overtime back wages as a result of the department's investigation worked as welders, fitters, tackers, electricians, blasters, painters, forklift operators and warehouse personnel. Payment of back wages is ongoing. This case also has been referred to the Louisiana Workforce Commission for review.

"May 3, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20130503,Statement of acting Labor Secretary Seth D. Harris on April employment numbers,"WASHINGTON – Acting Secretary of Labor Seth D. Harris issued the following statement about the April 2013 Employment Situation report released today: ""This morning's report shows that the economy added 165,000 total nonfarm jobs in April, and the unemployment rate dipped to 7.5 percent, a four-year low. That means 6.8 million new jobs over 38 consecutive months of private-sector job growth following the Great Recession. The revisions to February and March that show additional employment gains of 114,000 jobs are further indication that – to this point – 2013 has shown a fuller, more accelerated jobs recovery than we have yet seen. ""The unemployment rate has declined by 0.4 percentage point since January. In April, the number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) declined by 258,000. Significant gains this month in professional and business services, health care and retail employment are indications that many of the jobs being added are providing good, middle-class opportunities for the unemployed. The bottom line is that people are finding work: There are 1.65 million more people working today than 12 months ago. ""But let us not mistake a report that exceeds our expectations with unequivocal economic success. The difference between a moderate jobs report and an excellent report is the sequester. These misguided, arbitrary budget cuts are putting the brakes on an economy that is gaining momentum in the private sector just when we need to hit the gas. Because of the sequester, we are not creating the abundance of new jobs that will put everyone who wants to work back on the job and end the cruel game of economic musical chairs that leaves so many hard-working people out of work when the music stops. We need a balanced approach that makes investments in job-creating activities while pursuing a long-term deficit reduction strategy. ""President Obama has proposed several measures that will jump-start the economy and catalyze job growth. He continues to push for infrastructure investments that will breathe new life into the construction industry, in particular. In addition to physical infrastructure, we need to modernize our skills infrastructure, providing the training and investments in human capital that will prepare people for good jobs and give them ladders of opportunity."""

LLC, a federal construction contractor, has settled allegations of hiring discrimination against minority job applicants at its Jefferson facility. Investigators with the Labor Department's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs determined that the company's hiring process violated Executive Order 11246 by creating a disparate impact on African-American, Hispanic, Asian and Native American job seekers. As a result, 14 qualified minority applicants were denied the opportunity to fairly compete for positions as laborers and deckhands between 2009 and 2011. ""The people of the Gulf Coast have shown tremendous resilience in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, the BP oil spill and the Great Recession,"" said OFCCP Director Patricia A. Shiu. ""Our job — and the job of taxpayer-funded construction contractors like Bertucci — is to make sure the doors of opportunity are open for all workers who want to be a part of rebuilding and fortifying their communities. This agreement underscores that commitment by facilitating success for the workers, the company and the government agency involved."" Under the terms of the conciliation agreement, Bertucci will pay $70,000 in back wages and interest to the 14 affected workers and extend at least six offers of employment — with retroactive seniority — as positions become available. Furthermore, the company will revise its selection process to provide better training for hiring managers, annually review supervisors' adherence to employment policies and affirmative action obligations, and improve its recruitment efforts in order to avoid future violations. Bertucci provides a variety of flood control and coastal restoration services, including environmental dredging and disposal, stone placement in vulnerable waterways, and levee construction and armament. During the two-year period reviewed by OFCCP investigators, Bertucci held more than $80 million in government contracts with the U.S. Army. In addition to Executive Order 11246, OFCCP enforces Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974. These three laws require those who do business with the federal government, both contractors and subcontractors, to follow the fair and reasonable standard that they not discriminate in employment on the basis of sex, race, color, religion, national origin, disability or status as a protected veteran.

"April 29, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20130429,OSHA launches initiative to protect temporary workers,"Workers' Memorial Day remembers those who died on the job WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration today announced an initiative to further protect temporary employees from workplace hazards. The announcement was made during a program at the department's headquarters marking Workers' Memorial Day – an annual observance to honor workers who have died on the job and renew a commitment to making work sites across the country safer. OSHA today sent a memorandum to the agency's regional administrators directing field inspectors to assess whether employers who use temporary workers are complying with their responsibilities under the Occupational Safety and Health Act. Inspectors will use a newly created code in their information system to denote when temporary workers are exposed to safety and health violations. Additionally, they will assess whether temporary workers received required training in a language and vocabulary they could understand. The memo, which can be viewed at https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/standardinterpretations/2013-04-29 , underscores the duty of employers to protect all workers from hazards. ""On Workers' Memorial Day, we mourn the loss of the thousands of workers who die each year on the job from preventable hazards,"" said Dr. David Michaels, assistant secretary of labor for occupational safety and health. ""Many of those killed and injured are temporary workers who often perform the most dangerous jobs have limited English proficiency and are not receiving the training and protective measures required. Workers must be safe, whether they've been on the job for one day or for 25 years."" Workers' Memorial Day is observed nationally on April 28. In addition, OSHA has begun working with the American Staffing Association and employers that use staffing agencies, to promote best practices ensuring that temporary workers are protected from job hazards. In recent months, OSHA has received a series of reports about temporary workers suffering fatal injuries – many during their first days on a job. OSHA has issued citations when the employer failed to provide adequate protections, including safety training. Last week, the department's Bureau of Labor Statistics released new data from the Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries about workers killed on the job in 2011. Fatal work injuries involving contractors accounted for 542 – or 12 percent – of the 4,693 fatal work injuries reported. Hispanic/Latino contractors accounted for 28 percent of fatal work injuries among contractors, well above their 16 percent share of the overall fatal work injury total for the year.

"April 25, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20130425,MSHA announces results of March impact inspections,"ARLINGTON, Va. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration today announced that federal inspectors issued 155 citations and two orders during special impact inspections conducted at eight coal mines and four metal/nonmetal mines last month, representing the lowest number of orders issued during targeted monthly inspections over nearly three years. The monthly inspections, which began in force in April 2010 following the explosion at the Upper Big Branch Mine, involve mines that merit increased agency attention and enforcement due to their poor compliance history or particular compliance concerns. These matters include high numbers of violations or closure orders; frequent hazard complaints or hotline calls; plan compliance issues; inadequate workplace examinations; a high number of accidents, injuries or illnesses; fatalities; adverse conditions such as increased methane liberation, faulty roof conditions and inadequate ventilation; and respirable dust. ""While I say this with a word of caution, the results of the latest impact inspections are part of a positive trend in overall mine safety and health compliance that includes reductions in the number of chronic violators and all-time low fatal and injury rates,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""We believe that impact inspections, pattern of violation actions and other measures, as well as efforts by the mining industry, are contributing factors. However, there is more to be done, and there are those who still don't take responsibility for the safety and health of the miners they employ."" As an example from last month, MSHA conducted an impact inspection March 3-7 at Robinson Nevada Mining Co.'s Robinson Operation, a large surface copper mine in White Pine County, Nev. As a result, inspectors issued 32 citations. The impact inspection was the second conducted at this operation. Some of the conditions cited during this latest inspection include failure to keep areas free of hazards that could result in miners suffering injuries from slips, trips or falls. For instance, a coiled-up cable from a welding machine, along with 2- to 3 feet of material, impeded travel in a walkway. Additionally, 2- to 3 inches of inches of water had collected in the sump area. Two citations were issued for failure to correct dangerous conditions at the filter crusher, and a starter cabinet had oil-soaked fuses and contactors, creating a fire hazard. At the welding shop, the ground prong of an extension cord was broken off, exposing miners to electrical hazards. Further, two citations were issued for not maintaining brakes in functional condition on two maintenance trucks. Inspectors found that a 3,200-gallon fuel truck was leaking a large amount of diesel fuel, creating the potential for a fire or explosion. A citation was issued for not performing a pre-shift inspection on a truck before placing it in operation. Inspectors found that the backup alarm was not functional, the fire extinguisher had discharged, and the operator was not wearing his seat belt. Other citations were issued for failure to: identify power switches, provide adequate circuit overload protection, set the parking brake on an unattended truck, properly store hazardous materials and maintain a fire alarm system in working order. Since April 2010, MSHA has conducted 591 impact inspections and issued 10,191 citations, 948 orders and 43 safeguards. View the spreadsheet (PDF)"

Investigators with the department's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs determined that Goodwill's hiring process favored female applicants for entry-level positions as attendants at local donation centers, in part because of perceptions that women have better customer service skills. The investigation concluded that 200 qualified men were denied the opportunity to advance to the offer stage. ""Sex discrimination in the workplace can take many forms, and we are committed to fighting all of them,"" said OFCCP Director Patricia A. Shiu. ""That means getting away from outdated notions about what constitutes 'men's work' and what constitutes 'women's work.' Throughout the past century, both the Labor Department and Goodwill have shared a common purpose of serving the disadvantaged and making workers self-sufficient. This settlement builds on that proud tradition by giving every worker a fair shot at a good job."" OFCCP's Los Angeles District Office conducted the investigation. Under the terms of the conciliation agreement, Goodwill will pay $130,970 in back wages to the affected individuals and as openings occur will make 18 job offers to qualified men who were not previously offered positions. Goodwill also has agreed to undertake extensive self-monitoring measures and training to ensure that all hiring practices fully comply with Executive Order 11246, the federal law that prohibits federal contractors and subcontractors from discriminating in employment decisions on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or national origin. Covered government contractors must take affirmative action to ensure that equal opportunity is provided in all aspects of their employment. Goodwill Industries of Southern California operates dozens of retail stores and donation centers in parts of Los Angeles, Riverside and San Bernardino counties. Goodwill has more than $2.5 million in contracts with several branches of the U.S. military and federal government agencies in California, and participates in a contract with the U.S. General Services Administration to provide custodial, facilities, grounds maintenance and other services at federal sites as part of its employment training and assistance programs. Proceeds from sales at Goodwill retail stores help support its employment and training services. In addition to Executive Order 11246, OFCCP enforces Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974.

Between Jan. 1 and March 31, 11 miners died in workplace accidents. Eight fatalities occurred in coal mines, while three occurred in metal/nonmetal mines. Six coal miners were killed in less than one month, four of them in West Virginia, which prompted increased action by MSHA; the agency issued a safety alert, and MSHA inspectors, supervisors and managers traveled throughout the state to advise miners, miners' representatives, mining supervisors and operators about this trend. In coal mining, two miners each died in machinery, powered haulage and roof fall accidents. One miner each died in accidents involving exploding vessels under pressure and hoisting. In metal/nonmetal mining, one miner each died in accidents involving fall of highwall, machinery, and explosives and breaking agents. MSHA has undertaken a number of measures to prevent mining deaths, injuries and illnesses, including increased surveillance and strategic enforcement through impact inspections at mines with troubling compliance histories; enhanced pattern of violations actions; special initiatives such as ""Rules to Live By,"" which focuses attention on the most common causes of mining deaths; and outreach efforts with mining stakeholders. Mining fatality and injury rates were the lowest ever in 2011. Preliminary data for 2012 show that mine safety continues to move in the right direction with fatality rates for all mining reaching an all-time low: .0107 deaths per 200,000 hours worked. The rate of reported injuries was 2.56 per 200,000 hours worked, also the lowest rate on record. ""It has taken the efforts of MSHA and the entire mining industry to reach these milestones,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""But while mining deaths and injuries are at historic lows, more action is needed by all of us to prevent mining injuries, illnesses and deaths.""

"April 17, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20130417,"Judge orders Arizona worker be offered reinstatement, paid back wages and expenses under Family and Medical Leave Act following US Labor investigation","Driver and family lost income, critical health care coverage when company changed hands PHOENIX — A U.S. district court judge in Phoenix by a consent judgment has ordered that an Arizona delivery driver be offered reinstatement and receive back pay and reimbursement of medical expenses under the Family and Medical Leave Act. The U.S. Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division found that DS Waters of America Inc. discriminated against the driver when it failed to reinstate him at the end of an approved FMLA-covered leave period. The Atlanta, Ga.-based employer, doing business as Sparkletts, acquired Mesa-based O Premium Waters shortly after the employee began the leave. The department's investigation determined that Sparkletts, as the successor company, had a legal obligation to allow this employee to complete his leave and then restore him to an equivalent position as required by the act. Since 1993, the FMLA has helped covered workers in this country balance work and family responsibilities by providing job protected leave to care for their own serious health condition or that of a family member. The law allows workers to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave annually, including to bond with a newborn, newly adopted or newly placed child or care for a seriously ill child, spouse or parent, without fear of losing their jobs. ""Twenty years ago, the FMLA codified a simple and fundamental principle in this country: Workers should not have to choose between the job they need and the family members they love and who need their care,"" said acting Secretary of Labor Seth D. Harris. ""Employers must abide by this principle in both their policies and practices."" ""This case is a real victory for workers and families seeking justice against unlawful employment practices,"" added Mary Beth Maxwell, acting deputy administrator of the Wage and Hour Division. ""An employee was suddenly left without a job, paycheck or medical benefits when the company changed hands. He and his family suffered emotional and financial stress at a time when they could least afford it."" The department's investigation determined that, at the time of the acquisition, Sparkletts hired approximately 87 percent of O Premium Waters' drivers at the Mesa location but excluded the driver on approved medical leave. Sparkletts' refusal to rehire the employee and continue the employment benefits he had as an employee of O Premium Waters, including medical, dental and vision insurance for him and his family, violated the law. To resolve the violations, the company has been required to make an offer of employment with full seniority credit and reimburse the worker $31,464 in out-of-pocket medical expenses, in addition to paying him $26,871 in back wages. This case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona, and the department was represented by its regional Office of the Solicitor in San Francisco.

An investigation by the department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration found that between January 2006 and August 2008 the defendants withheld $10,582 in employee contributions to the plan, but failed to segregate the contributions from the company assets as soon as they could do so and failed to forward them to the plan in a timely manner, resulting in lost opportunity costs for the plan participants. Additionally, Cotter and DeBusk comingled the contributions with the company’s general assets. “Employees contributing to a 401(k) plan expect that their funds will be available for retirement. These defendants betrayed that trust, and the Labor Department is committed to seeing that the plan participants’ funds are fully restored,” said Isabel Colon, director of EBSA’s regional office in Atlanta. The suit seeks to require the defendants to restore all losses to the plans, including lost interest or lost opportunity costs, and to offset the defendants’ 401(k) plan accounts by the amount of losses if the losses are not otherwise restored by the defendants. In addition, the suit asks that the defendants be permanently barred from serving as fiduciaries of any employee benefit plan subject to ERISA and for a fiduciary successor to be appointed at the defendant’s expense. The company was located in LaVergne, Tenn., and provided ambulance services before it filed bankruptcy in March 2009. The plan has currently 15 participants. The case is being litigated by the department’s Regional Office of the Solicitor in Atlanta.

This is one of the largest settlements in the Wage and Hour Division's history. The agreement is a part of a consent judgment approved today by Judge Juan M. Pérez Giménez of the U.S. District Court for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Officials representing the commonwealth and the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation also have agreed to take significant steps to ensure future compliance with the law, including installing an electronic timekeeping system at its facilities, training supervisors in the use of the new system, hiring additional staff to reduce the need for overtime and adjusting daily tours of duty for guards. The commonwealth government already has restored more than $15 million in back wages due to employees for overtime hours worked since November 2011. The remaining back wages will be paid on an installment basis, and distributed to current and former employees as scheduled through 2016. ""We are pleased that the commonwealth of Puerto Rico has been our partner, through a long and arduous process, in correcting the improper payment of back wages,"" said acting Secretary of Labor Seth D. Harris. ""This agreement returns hard-earned wages to workers and underscores the U.S. Department of Labor's commitment to ensuring that workers receive the wages they earn, as mandated by federal law."" The FLSA requires that covered employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 for all hours worked, plus time and one-half their regular hourly rates, including commissions, bonuses and incentive pay, for hours worked beyond 40 per week. In general, ""hours worked"" includes all time an employee must be on duty, or on the employer's premises or at any other prescribed place of work, from the beginning of the first principal work activity to the end of the last principal activity of the workday. Additionally, the law requires that accurate records of employees' wages, hours and other conditions of employment be maintained. Under certain conditions, employees of state or local government agencies may receive compensatory time off, at a rate of not less than one and one-half hours for each overtime hour worked, instead of cash overtime pay. Law enforcement personnel may accrue or ""bank"" up to 480 hours of comp time. In this case, the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation regularly allowed employees' comp time ""banks"" to greatly exceed 480 hours. The back wages found due for the employees are the cash amounts of unpaid comp time accrued in excess of the limit. ""The Labor Department has been working tirelessly with the commonwealth of Puerto Rico to reach this agreement,"" said Mary Beth Maxwell, acting deputy administrator of the Wage and Hour Division. ""I am very pleased that staff in our Caribbean region persevered, ensured these employees will be paid the back wages they are owed and brought this case to conclusion.

The 18-point plan includes concrete actions with specific time frames that Guatemala will implement within six months to improve labor law enforcement. This is the first labor case that the United States has brought to dispute settlement under a trade agreement.

"April 10, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20130410,US Department of Labor releases fiscal year 2014 budget request,"WASHINGTON – Acting Secretary of Labor Seth D. Harris today released the U.S. Department of Labor's fiscal year 2014 budget request, which supports President Obama's plan to strengthen the economy and grow the middle class through continued investments in training and resources for job seekers. ""The Department of Labor's fiscal year 2014 budget request is a critical ingredient in the Obama administration's plan to grow the economy from the middle class out, not from the top down. The investments we make at the department will help create good jobs, upgrade workers' skills so that they can succeed in those jobs, and make sure Americans can support their families with a decent wage and secure benefits,"" said acting Secretary Harris. The president's budget for the Department of Labor requests $12.1 billion in discretionary funding. It invests in programs that improve services for workers and job seekers by modernizing the federal job training system and creating employment opportunities for the long-term unemployed and low-income adults and youths. The request devotes significant resources to putting our veterans, particularly those with disabilities or other significant barriers to employment, back to work. It provides improved re-employment services that enable individuals newly separated from the military to successfully transition into civilian careers. As the economy changes, training and employment programs must innovate and adapt to effectively help American workers gain needed skills. The FY 2014 budget proposes a new Universal Displaced Worker program that will reach more than a million workers a year with a set of core services, replacing two more narrowly-targeted programs and ensuring that all dislocated workers receive high-quality job search assistance. In addition, the budget request provides $150 million for a competitive Workforce Innovation Fund to test new evidence-based workforce development strategies and bold systemic reforms coming from states and localities. Of that amount, $50 million will be used to identify strategies to help veterans, military family members, and members of the National Guard and Reserve, and $10 million will be focused on identifying effective strategies to improve outcomes for disconnected youths. The budget proposes $8 billion for a Community College to Career Fund, to be administered jointly with the U.S. Department of Education, that will invest in partnerships between community colleges and business to train workers for good-paying jobs in high-growth and high-demand industries. It would begin in 2015 as a successor to the Trade Adjustment Assistance Community College and Career Training program. The department's request is focused on helping the long-term unemployed get back to work. It includes a $4 billion Re-employment NOW program, which incorporates a number of reforms to help Unemployment Insurance claimants and other long-term unemployed individuals get back to work more quickly, and a $12.5 billion Pathways Back to Work Fund to make it easier for workers to remain connected to the workforce and gain new skills for long-term employment. In addition, the budget provides $25 million to encourage innovative states to come forward with new and better strategies to return UI beneficiaries to work. The budget also proposes reforms to put state UI systems on the path to solvency. Highlights of the FY 2014 budget request include: An additional $5.8 million for Mine Safety and Health Administration enforcement programs to pursue strategies that prevent death, disease and injury from mining, and $2.5 million to implement recommendations from the internal review conducted in the wake of the Upper Big Branch Mine disaster. An additional $5.9 million to bolster the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's enforcement of the numerous laws that protect workers and others from retaliation for reporting unsafe and unscrupulous practices. Nearly $14 million to combat the misclassification of workers as independent contractors, which deprives workers of benefits and protections to which they are legally entitled and puts law-abiding businesses at a disadvantage against employers who violate the law. An additional $3.4 million for the Wage and Hour Division to support greater enforcement of the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Family and Medical Leave Act. $5 million for the creation of a State Paid Leave Fund to assist workers who need to take time off to care for a child or other family member. An initiative to encourage companies to fully fund their pension benefits by authorizing the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. board to adjust premiums and take into account the risks that different retirement plan sponsors pose to their retirees. Under the initiative, the PBGC is estimated to save $25 billion over the next decade. Finally, the department's FY 2014 budget request continues existing efforts to enhance program effectiveness and improve efficiency. The department will invest in program evaluations to be overseen by the chief evaluation officer and requests increased authority to set aside funds from major program accounts for more evaluations. These investments will provide the department with valuable information about strategies and approaches that work so that resources can be allocated strategically.

"April 9, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20130409,Operator of southwestern Pennsylvania coal mine found in flagrant violation,"ARLINGTON, Va. – Rox Coal Inc., which operates the Geronimo Mine in Somerset County, Pa., has been found in violation of a mandatory electrical hazard safety standard by an administrative law judge with the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission. The ALJ deemed the violation ""quintessentially flagrant"" and ordered the company to pay a $110,000 civil penalty. The ALJ's finding sustained the Mine Safety and Health Administration's issuance and assessment of the violation as flagrant following an investigation into an electrical accident at the Geronimo Mine. On Oct. 3, 2007, a miner was shocked while changing the fuse on a high-voltage switch house at Geronimo Mine. The mine's chief electrician intentionally had disabled the safety switch two days prior to sending the miner and a co-worker to change fuses. As a result, the miners worked within inches of 7,200 live volts while performing this work. MSHA found the condition to be a violation of a mandatory electrical safety standard pursuant to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. According to 30 Code of Federal Regulations 75.512, all electric equipment shall be frequently examined, tested and properly maintained by a qualified person to assure safe operating conditions. When a potentially dangerous condition is found on electric equipment, such equipment shall be removed from service until such condition is corrected. MSHA also found the violation to be significant and substantial, and highly likely to result in permanently disabling injuries. The agency noted that the mine operator acted with reckless disregard in allowing this violation to exist and miners to work in close proximity to high voltage electricity. ""Mine operators must take responsibility at all times to prevent conditions that can lead to accidents and injuries,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""Those who deliberately put miners' well-being at risk must be held accountable."" The administrative law judge ruling in favor of MSHA's assessment of the violation held that a violation does not need to have been previously cited in order to be considered a ""repeat"" flagrant and assessed a civil penalty. The Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006 defines a flagrant violation as ""a reckless or repeated failure to make reasonable efforts to eliminate a known violation of a mandatory safety and health standard that substantially and proximately caused, or reasonably could have been expected to cause, death or serious bodily injury."" A civil penalty of up to $242,000 may be assessed for each flagrant violation."

An investigation conducted by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Employee Benefits Security Administration found that from January 2006 through May 2009, employee contributions were withheld by the company and deposited into the plan’s trust for periods ranging up to 178 days after they were deducted from the employees’ compensation. The investigation also found that from March 2009 to May 2009, the company did not deposit payroll deductions withheld from the employee’s compensation into the plan’s trust. In addition, the company ceased operations and filed for bankruptcy in 2009. The plan documents require that the plan be terminated and the assets be distributed to participants upon the liquidation or dissolution of the company. In total, the profit sharing plan was owed approximately $22,027.46 in unremitted contributions and lost opportunity costs. The plan had approximately 46 participants entitled to distributions of their benefit. Resolution: A complaint was filed in federal court against plan trustee Charles Yaskulski, Eagle Warranty Corp., and Eagle Warranty Corp. profit sharing plan. The department is seeking the removal of Charles Yaskulski and Eagle Warranty Corp. as fiduciaries with respect to the plan, and the appointment of an independent fiduciary with full authority to manage the remaining plan assets, allocate any assets contributed to the plan, and distribute any recovery received to participants. The department is also seeking a permanent bar enjoining Charles Yaskulski and Eagle Warranty Corp. from acting in any fiduciary capacity in the future.

"April 8, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20130408,MSHA releases preliminary data for 2012 reflecting record low fatality and injury rates in mining,"ARLINGTON, Va. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration today announced the release of preliminary data for 2012 that indicate the lowest fatality and injury rates in the history of U.S. mining. ""MSHA at a Glance,"" with updated information on inspections, violations, mines and miners, as well as injury and fatality rates, is available on the agency's website, http://www.msha.gov , under ""Fact Sheets."" ""These preliminary numbers clearly show that actions undertaken by MSHA and the mining industry continue to move mine safety in the right direction, with improvements in compliance with the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, and a reduction in injury and fatality rates,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. In 2012, the fatality rate was .0107 deaths per 200,000 hours worked. The rate of reported injuries was 2.56 per 200,000 hour worked. These reductions replace the prior year's record historical low rates. Although the number of mines in the U.S. decreased slightly (from 14,176 in 2011 to 14,058 in 2012), the number of miners increased from 381,209 to 387,671. Thirty-five miners died on the job in 2012, tying the record low number of deaths in mining set in 2009. The number of citations and orders MSHA issued fell from 157,052 in 2011 to 140,007 in 2012, an 11 percent decrease. In coal mining, 19 miners died in on-the-job accidents in 2012, the second lowest number ever. The fatality rate was .0151 deaths per 200,000 hours worked, also the second lowest ever recorded. The rate of reported injuries was 3.15 per 200,000 hours worked, the lowest ever recorded. The number of citations and orders issued declined, from 93,451 in 2011 to 79,327 in 2012, a 15 percent reduction. The industry saw decreases in the number of mines (from 1,973 to 1,865) and in production (from 1,095 to 1,017 million tons) between 2011 and 2012. While the number of coal miners also decreased from a decades-long high of 143,437 in 2011 to 137,361 in 2012, it was the second highest for any year since 1994. In metal and nonmetal mining, the record-low fatality rate was .0080 deaths per 200,000 hours worked. Sixteen miners died in on-the-job accidents, equaling the record low set in 2011. The reported injury rate of 2.19 per 200,000 hours worked also was a record low. Citations and orders issued dropped from 63,601 in 2011 to 60,680 in 2012, a 5 percent reduction. While the number of metal and nonmetal mines remained steady in 2012, at 12,193, the number of miners increased from 237,772 in 2011 to 250,310 in 2012. In an effort to provide timely release of information, MSHA has established a new process to release preliminary year-end data in April after they are compiled in the first calendar quarter, and will update them in June."
"April 5, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20130405,Statement of acting Labor Secretary Seth D. Harris on March employment numbers,"WASHINGTON – Acting Secretary of Labor Seth D. Harris issued the following statement about the March 2013 Employment Situation report released today: ""With the addition of 95,000 new private sector jobs in March, we see more evidence that the U.S. economy continues to bounce back, but not quickly enough for too many middle-class families. The unemployment rate ticked downward slightly to 7.6 percent, the seventh consecutive month below 8 percent. ""Private employment has now increased for each of the last 37 months, with 6.5 million jobs created over that time. So while we have come a long way in just a few years' time, the economy is not yet clicking on all cylinders. We need to work together, Congress and the administration, to unleash its full potential. Americans are counting on Washington to be a catalyst for growth, not a roadblock. That means solving our fiscal challenges in a balanced way, with both responsible cuts and targeted investments to help workers get back on their feet. ""President Obama is pushing forward an agenda that will continue to revitalize the economy. He has recently called for a Partnership to Rebuild America, a new public-private initiative to provide more funding for infrastructure projects that create good middle-class jobs, particularly in construction. ""The administration will also continue to press for new investments in training, re-employment services and skills development for American workers particularly veterans that will spur further job creation. ""Every American who is willing to work hard deserves a job, but we owe a special debt to our nation's veterans. Recently released 2012 figures show veterans finding and keeping jobs in larger numbers. Veterans' unemployment fell from 8.3 percent in 2011 to 7.0 percent in 2012 (with a corresponding drop from 12.1 percent to 9.9 percent for post-9/11 veterans). Additional resources to help service members complete the transition to civilian life are an important way to honor their sacrifice and a sound investment in a growing economy powered by a thriving middle class. ""The March report showed continued gains in professional and business services (+51,000), health care (+23,000) and construction (+18,000). But retail trade employment experienced a decline of 24,000 jobs after an average of 32,000 jobs added over the prior six months."""

Allegations: On November 1, 1995, KIP Corp., based in Charlotte, N.C., established the KIP Corp. retirement savings plan for its employees. During the course of an investigation by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Employee Benefits Security Administration, the agency found that between March 2009 and March 2010, the defendants, the fiduciaries to the plan, failed to timely forward to the plan $85,142 in employee contributions and employer matching contributions.

"April 1, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20130401-0,US Department of Labor releases Affordable Care Act study on self-insured plans,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Labor today transmitted to Congress the third annual report on self-insured employee health benefit plans. The report, which is established by the Affordable Care Act, contains general information on self-insured employee health benefit plans and financial information on the employers that sponsor them. Self-insured plans, unlike fully insured plans, are generally plans in which the sponsor retains the risk associated with paying covered health expenses, rather than paying a premium and transferring the risk to an insurance company. Some sponsors retain the risk for a subset of the benefits, but transfer the risk for the remaining benefits to health insurers – that is, they finance the plans' benefits using a mixture of self-insurance and insurance. Self-insurance is more common among larger sponsors, mainly because the health expenses of larger groups are more predictable and therefore larger sponsors face less risk. This year's report utilizes a revised algorithm to identify self-insured plans from those that are fully-insured or use a mixed funding arrangement. These revisions, based on a study of Form 5500 filings, indicate that previous reports overstated the number of fully insured and mixed-funded health plans and identified too few self-insured plans. Consequently, this report is not directly comparable to its predecessors and should not be used with them to project trends in health insurance funding. Rather, estimates presented in the 2013 report should be viewed as the department's best estimates of plan funding arrangements for 2010 and earlier years. Health benefit plans covering private-sector employees must file a Form 5500 Annual Return/Report of Employee Benefit Plan – generally, if they cover 100 or more participants or hold assets in trust. This report includes information on self-insured and mixed-insured health benefit plans that are required to file a Form 5500 and presents data on such plans for 2010, the latest year for which complete data are available. The department estimates that nearly 20,000 health plans filing a Form 5500 for 2010 were self-insured and approximately 4,000 were mixed-insured. These plans covered 30 million and 26 million participants respectively. However, because many self-insured health plans do not meet the filing requirements and therefore do not file the Form 5500, this report likely underestimates the total number of self-insured plans. The full report can be found on the department's Employee Benefits Security Administration Affordable Care Act page, or at http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/healthreform/index.html#5 .

"March 28, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/odep/odep20130328,Accommodations for workers can help retain institutional knowledge,"US Labor Department briefs offer recommendations for responding to aging workforce WASHINGTON — Providing accommodations to aging workers with disabilities, chronic health problems or reduced work capacity can help employers retain experienced staff who might otherwise leave the workforce prematurely, according to two briefs issued today by the U.S. Department of Labor. The briefs provide recommendations for state and federal policymakers, employers and health care industry leaders on retaining critical talent. One identifies successful strategies, including supportive policies, for retaining aging health care professionals without sacrificing patient care. The other recommends that employers and policymakers adopt early interventions to prevent disability-related job loss by providing workers with assistive technology and other workplace accommodations. The briefs summarize assessments and recommendations from two conferences sponsored by the department's Office of Disability Employment Policy that gathered experts on aging, disability and employment to discuss the impact of aging on the national workforce and health care systems. The U.S Census Bureau projects that, by 2020, many of the 25 million baby boomers that make up more than 40 percent of the current U.S. labor force will exit, leaving many jobs unfilled and taking decades of accumulated knowledge with them. In addition, as the population ages, the demand for health care services will increase just as many health care workers are facing retirement. ""A confluence of demographic, economic, and health factors have intersected to make the employment situation of older Americans a matter of urgent national importance,"" said Kathy Martinez, assistant secretary of labor for disability employment policy. ""By promoting workforce flexibility, harnessing widespread advances in assistive technology, and using other types of workplace accommodations, we can slow the mass exodus of older workers in health care and other industries, and continue to benefit from the knowledge and skills they bring.""

"March 27, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20130327,MSHA announces results of February impact inspections,"ARLINGTON, Va. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration today announced that federal inspectors issued 196 citations, 24 orders and three safeguards during special impact inspections conducted at 11 coal mines and three metal/nonmetal mines last month. The monthly inspections, which began in force in April 2010 following the explosion at the Upper Big Branch Mine, involve mines that merit increased agency attention and enforcement due to their poor compliance history or particular compliance concerns. These matters include high numbers of violations or closure orders; frequent hazard complaints or hotline calls; plan compliance issues; inadequate workplace examinations; a high number of accidents, injuries or illnesses; fatalities; adverse conditions such as increased methane liberation, faulty roof conditions and inadequate ventilation; and respirable dust. As an example from last month, MSHA conducted an impact inspection during the evening shift Feb. 19 at Coal River Mining LLC's Fork Creek No. 1 Mine in Boone County, W.Va. Ventilation was the main focus of the inspection and resulted in 16 issuances – 13 of which were closure orders for the operator's unwarrantable failure to comply with health and safety standards. This impact inspection was MSHA's first at this mine. ""In spite of finding overall improvements in compliance since we began conducting impact inspections, examples like Fork Creek No. 1 show what takes place at some mines when MSHA is not expected to be there and illustrates the importance of our impact inspection strategy,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""The conditions our inspectors observed, which resulted in closure orders, demonstrated a complete disregard for the health and safety of miners and for safe mining practices."" The phones were captured to prevent advance notice of the inspection. MSHA found that Fork Creek Mine No. 1 failed to follow its approved ventilation plan in numerous instances. The team observed two continuous mining machines operating simultaneously on the same split of air, which is prohibited. A number of water sprays on one of the continuous mining machines, used to control dust and the ignition of coal dust or methane, were inoperative. Ventilation curtains, which direct the flow of air in the mine and move respirable dust and methane out of working areas, were either missing or rolled up against the mine roof while equipment and miners were working in the area. One machine cut and loaded rock and coal with the ventilation curtain rolled up for a distance of more than 60 feet, exceeding the allowable curtain setback distance. Inspectors found another machine cutting and loading more than 50 feet past the last crosscut with the entire line curtain rolled up and tied against the mine roof at distances from 30 to 50 feet in the entry. Inspectors also observed a roof bolting machine operating in an area with no ventilation because line curtains were not in place. These failures to properly ventilate the mine to control methane and respirable coal dust exposed miners to substantially increased levels of respirable dust that causes black lung disease and the potential for an explosion due to unsafe accumulations of methane and coal dust. Haulageways, used to travel within the mine, were not maintained wet to control dusty conditions. The operator allowed shuttle car equipment to operate with visible dust in suspension. The ventilation standard 75.370(a)(1), which requires mine ventilation plans to control methane and respirable dust, has been cited 25 times over a two-year period at this mine. Additional orders and citations were issued for accumulations of combustible materials in the form of loose coal, lump coal and coal fines. Rockdust, used to prevent coal dust explosions, was not properly applied. The rockdust standard, 75.400, has been cited 34 times over a two-year period at this mine. MSHA ordered two sections of the mine shut down until conditions could be improved. The operator implemented corrective actions, some of which took three days to complete in order to terminate the closure orders. Since April 2010, MSHA has conducted 579 impact inspections and issued 10,036 citations, 946 orders and 43 safeguards.

"March 21, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20130321,Federal court grants judgment against Kentucky coal mine operator,"ARLINGTON, Va. – The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky has granted a default judgment against D & C Mining Corp. of Harlan County, Ky., affirming the U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration's complaint. The mine operator owes $1.67 million in unpaid civil penalties for violations of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, along with interest and administrative costs. According to the judgment, D & C is enjoined from violating or failing or refusing to comply with any final orders issued under the Mine Act by failing to pay already delinquent or future civil money penalties. The judgment also orders D & C to post an appropriate bond with MSHA to guarantee future compliance with the Mine Act – including the payment of final orders issued under the Mine Act – and to keep all property in which it holds an ownership interest securely at the site of its existing mine and not sell or move the property to any other location. In March 2012, the Labor Department and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Kentucky filed the complaint against D & C Mining alleging that the company owes $1.67 million in civil penalties for 1,244 violations cited between Jan. 24, 2006, and Feb. 8, 2012. D & C Mining has undergone 10 impact inspections by MSHA since April 2010, more than any other mining operation in the country. The monthly inspections target mines that merit increased agency attention and enforcement due to their poor compliance history or particular compliance concerns. ""Not only has this mine operator repeatedly disregarded health and safety standards and put its miners at tremendous risk, it has flouted any attempt by the federal government to collect penalties for violations that have been assessed,"" said Joseph A.

Post-9/11 veterans saw an encouraging decline to 9.9 percent in 2012 from 12.1 percent in 2011. Other categories also saw improvements. Recent broad-based gains in the overall economy have helped to drive down these rates as we continue adding jobs at a steady pace, but support services that address the unique challenges faced by veterans are essential to improving upon today's positive report. ""The Obama administration is deeply committed to ensuring the well-being of America's veterans, transitioning service members and military families. Assuring veterans a pathway to good jobs is a critical element of that commitment. First lady Michelle Obama and Dr. Jill Biden have demonstrated a tireless dedication to veterans through the Joining Forces Initiative which is securing commitments from thousands of private employers who recognize that veterans bring unique skills and leadership to their workplaces, and for a lift to their bottom lines. ""The Veterans' Employment and Training Service at the Labor Department is the lead government agency dedicated to veterans' employment. VETS serves hundreds of thousands of veterans and transitioning service members each year. In addition, programs like My Next Move for Veterans, the Transition Assistance Programs and the Veterans Gold Card provide enhanced employment services to veterans and transitioning service members, and give targeted support in education and training that will help us reduce the unnecessarily high unemployment rates among younger veterans and female veterans. ""While this morning's report shows that we are moving in the right direction on reducing unemployment among America's veterans, much more needs to be done to ensure that no veteran struggles to find work after serving honorably to keep us safe and secure."""

Most of the workers were employed at 39 work sites throughout Missouri; however, the grant also will serve Missouri residents employed at three locations in Kansas and one in Oklahoma. It may also assist workers leased to Hostess by other companies. The grant, awarded to the Missouri Division of Workforce Development, will provide assistance to workers in conjunction with other benefits they will receive as a result of their eligibility for Trade Adjustment Assistance. Under this grant and the TAA program, affected workers will receive the training and support services they need to successfully find new jobs in their state. In February, the department certified approximately 18,000 workers laid off in 48 states from 864 Hostess company locations as eligible to apply for TAA benefits. Of the $2,183,749 announced today, $1,257,671 will be released initially. Additional funding, up to the amount approved, will be made available as the state demonstrates a continued need for assistance.

The department expects to award 15 grants of up to $1.4 million each to organizations that will provide training and employment to inmates ages 18 and older participating in state or local work release programs. ""Funded programs will provide essential support for adults who have served their time and are looking for ways to re-enter the workforce, and support themselves and their families,"" said acting Secretary of Labor Seth D. Harris. ""These investments in rebuilding lives also reduce stress on state and local budgets, and contribute to increased community stability."" ETA has invested in five generations of the Reintegration of Ex-Offenders-Adult Program, which historically have been employment-centered. Research from the departments of Labor and Justice shows that ex-offenders are more likely to obtain employment and experience career growth if they acquire industry-recognized credentials. Since program year 2011, ETA has required grantees to provide training that leads to an industry-recognized credential prior to the end of the performance period. Additionally, ETA has found that programs offering pre-release services have higher post-release enrollment and more successful program outcomes. These grants are being made available through the Training to Work-Adult Re-entry program and will build on research findings to provide services to offenders who are enrolled in work release programs and are ready for work. Participants will have approved release dates typically ranging from six to nine months and are still under state or local correctional supervision. Grantees will focus on in-demand industries and occupations in which ex-offenders are eligible to work. Each year, approximately 700,000 inmates are released from state and federal prisons, and return to their communities and families. Without assistance to make a successful transition, the majority of former offenders return to criminal activity. In order to successfully reintegrate into their communities, it is essential that these individuals have the skills and support necessary to compete for and obtain jobs. Recipients of these grants must be located in or have existing staff presence, such as satellite offices or shared office space, in an area with high poverty and crime rates. Any nonprofit organization with 501(3)(c) status that meets the requirements of the solicitation may apply.

""Reauthorization of the Workforce Investment Act is long overdue. But I am disappointed that the House majority chose to pass a partisan bill rather than one that builds on WIA's strengths by streamlining and improving services, providing true ""one-stop shopping,"" employing regional and industry-driven economic development strategies, toughening accountability, and promoting and replicating best practices. ""Despite taking some positive steps, the SKILLS Act falls far short of what our workers and businesses need by freezing funding for the next seven years and eliminating or consolidating key programs in a way that would not serve job seekers with barriers to employment and specialized needs, including veterans, disadvantaged youth, people with disabilities, and migrant and seasonal farmworkers. Furthermore, the SKILLS Act doesn't ensure a voice for key stakeholders. Nor does it succeed in promoting continuous innovation or the replication of best practices. ""We must modernize, streamline and strengthen this system that has done so much for so many – with more than 2,700 American Job Centers serving roughly 33 million participants a year.

The order is the latest in a series of actions to arise from the department's continuing effort to address widespread violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act's minimum wage, overtime and record-keeping provisions in the Southern California apparel industry. ""Garment workers historically have been subjected to exploitation and paid substandard wages,"" said Solicitor of Labor M. Patricia Smith. ""The order underscores that everyone in the supply chain has a responsibility to ensure that workers receive the federal minimum wage and earned overtime, and it demonstrates our commitment to enforcing those protections despite tactics designed to obscure the employment relationship."" The division issued the subpoena on Aug. 16, 2012, during the course of an investigation into whether Forever 21 had violated the ""hot goods"" provision of the FLSA, which prohibits employers from shipping in commerce any goods produced in violation of the act's minimum wage, overtime or child labor standards. Under the FLSA, the secretary of labor may investigate and bring actions in federal court to enjoin violations. In the court's order granting the petition for enforcement of the investigative subpoena issued to Forever 21, Morrow found that the subpoena was part of a ""lawful investigation within the authority of the secretary."" The order was signed and entered March 7 in the U.S. District Court, Central District of California. Forever 21 is required to produce the requested documents within 10 days of that date. The subpoena initially was issued following the department's sweep of garment sewing factories in downtown Los Angeles, which began Aug. 7, 2012, and uncovered minimum wage and overtime violations in shops producing goods for major garment retailers. Investigators determined that garments produced in at least one of the shops investigated were destined for Forever 21 stores. Forever 21 refused to comply with the subpoena. In the past five years, the department has conducted more than 1,500 investigations of employers in Southern California's garment industry, finding violations in 93 percent of cases. The FLSA requires employers to pay covered, nonexempt employees no less than the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour and to pay overtime compensation at time and one-half employees' regular rates for hours worked beyond 40 in a week.

Grantees will be expected to use these longitudinal databases to conduct research and analysis aimed at determining the effectiveness of workforce and education programs, and to develop tools to inform customers of the publicly funded workforce system. This grant opportunity stems from the Obama administration's focus on access to high-quality data and is related to the U.S. Department of Education's Statewide Longitudinal Data Systems grants to build longitudinal education databases. Grantees will be expected to achieve multiple goals during the three-year grant period. These include developing or improving state workforce longitudinal data systems with individual-level information, enabling workforce data to be matched with education data to create longitudinal data systems, improving the quality and breadth of data in the workforce data systems, using longitudinal data to provide useful information about program operations, analyzing the performance of education and employment training programs, and providing user-friendly information to help consumers select the training and education programs that best suit their needs.

The economy added 236,000 new nonfarm payroll jobs last month. February marks three uninterrupted years of private sector employment growth, with a total of 6.4 million jobs created over that time. ""The economy is fighting back, but we can do better. We can accelerate the recovery by acting on President Obama's agenda to build a strong American economy from the middle class out rather than the top down making America a magnet for new jobs, equipping workers with the skills to succeed in those jobs and making sure that hard work leads to a decent living. ""The economy is poised for even more significant growth, but Congress should not hold it back. We can't cut our way to prosperity. Deficit reduction alone is not an economic strategy or a jobs plan. It's time for members of both parties in Congress to work together on a balanced deficit reduction plan and invest in the middle class – the engine of America's economic growth. ""The unemployment rate dipped slightly to 7.7 percent, the sixth straight month under 8 percent and the lowest level since December 2008. ""Growth was strong across economic sectors. Construction continued a 9-month growth trend, adding 48,000 jobs, the highest monthly increase since March 2007. Since January 2011, the economy has created 349,000 new construction jobs.

The department also has assessed $91,000 in civil money penalties against this employer because of the repeat and willful nature of the violations. Additionally, the employer has agreed to take proactive measures, including a three-year monitoring program at each gas station, to ensure future FLSA compliance. ""This agreement returns hard-earned wages to workers in one of only two states that still mandates full-service gas pumps,""said acting Secretary of Labor Seth D. Harris. ""All gas station owners and operators in New Jersey should take note of this precedent by reviewing their payroll practices and legal obligations. Gas station attendants are few in number, earn low wages, work long hours and often lack English proficiency — factors that contribute to their vulnerability as well as the importance of protecting their right to be paid properly."" Wage and Hour Division investigators found that employees often worked up to 84 hours per week, but did not receive earned overtime pay. Instead, many employees were paid partly on the payroll and partly off the books, sometimes in cash, to disguise the improper payment of overtime. The employer also failed to maintain accurate records of the hours employees worked. A consent judgment outlining the terms of the agreement between the Labor Department and the employer has been filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. The three-year monitoring program will be supervised by an independent monitor who will report to the department. It will include the installation of biometric time clocks in each establishment; a notice to workers regarding the terms of the compliance agreement; FLSA training for all employees in English and other languages; an anti-kickback protection clause to ensure that all workers are paid any back wages due; and a toll-free telephone number for workers to report violations to the monitor. In 2012, the Wage and Hour Division conducted more than 100 investigations as part of a multiyear enforcement initiative focused on FLSA compliance among New Jersey gas stations. More than $2.3 million in back wages was recovered for more than 500 gas station workers. The FLSA requires that covered, nonexempt employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour as well as one and one-half times their regular rates for hours worked over 40 per week. Additionally, the law requires that accurate records of employees' wages, hours and other conditions of employment be maintained. The FLSA also provides that employers who violate the law are, as a general rule, liable to employees for the back wages as well as an equal amount in liquidated damages.

This funding will provide re-employment services not only for miners who are laid off but for their spouses who have been homemakers and are, due to the loss of wages, seeking to enter the workforce to support their families. ""When families lose their entire source of income, they often need more than one job to make ends meet,"" said acting Secretary of Labor Seth D. Harris. ""This grant from the Labor Department will help prepare both displaced miners and their spouses for new employment in eastern Kentucky's growing industries."" This grant, awarded to the Eastern Kentucky Concentrated Employment Program Inc., will provide eligible laid off miners and spouses with training and other services they need to compete for employment in other industries throughout the area, such as business services, construction and skill trades, energy creation and transmission, and health care. Of the $5,192,500 announced today, $3,787,017 will be released initially. Additional funding up to the amount approved will be made available as EKCEP demonstrates a continued need for assistance. National Emergency Grants are part of the secretary of labor's discretionary fund and are awarded based on the ability to meet specific guidelines.

"February 28, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20130228-1,US Labor Department issues final rules for multiple employer health care arrangements,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Labor's Employee Benefits Security Administration today announced final rules under the Affordable Care Act to protect workers and employers whose health benefits are provided through Multiple Employer Welfare Arrangements. The final rules increase the department's enforcement authority to protect participants in MEWAs and call for such plans to adhere to enhanced filing requirements. ""A MEWA can be a means to offer benefits to workers where none other exists. But too often the individuals operating such arrangements take advantage of employers who want to make health insurance available to workers,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Employee Benefits Security Phyllis C. Borzi. ""Today's final rules give the department more tools to protect the employees of small companies that band together to purchase benefits."" A MEWA is an employee welfare plan or other arrangement through which multiple employers might seek to provide health care and other benefits to their workers. Employers are often told that MEWAs are more affordable than traditional forms of coverage, but unscrupulous promoters, marketers and operators of certain MEWAs have taken advantage of gaps in the law to avoid state insurance regulations, putting enrollees at financial risk. These actions include the requirement to maintain sufficient funding and adequate reserves to pay health care claims of workers and their families. EBSA has been involved in many cases where MEWAs have been operated by individuals who drained them of their assets through excessive administrative fees or outright embezzlement, leaving participants and their families with unexpected, unpaid health care bills. The Affordable Care Act includes provisions implemented by today's final rules that are designed to remedy these gaps. The final rules authorize the secretary of labor to immediately issue a cease and desist order when it is apparent that fraud is taking place within a MEWA. The secretary could also seize assets from a MEWA when there is probable cause that the plan is in a financially hazardous condition. The final rules also require MEWAs to register with the Labor Department prior to operating in a state. To streamline the process, the department is making available a new, all-electronic filing system that also will serve as a searchable registry of MEWAs. The final rules, and related changes to the Form 5500 Annual Return/Report, also enhance the department's ability to enforce Form M-1 filing requirements. This enhancement is achieved by requiring all employee welfare plans that file a Form M-1 to file a Form 5500 including information on compliance with Form M-1 filing requirements. Complete details on all provisions are included in the final rules and form revision notices, which will be published in the March 1 edition of the Federal Register.

""We are a country that believes in second chances,"" said acting Secretary of Labor Seth D. Harris. ""Job training offers opportunities to learn skills and reshape lives. The grants announced today will provide critical support for women and young people who are eager for employment and a productive role in their communities."" The department will award a total of $20 million to four organizations to operate programs that work with juvenile offenders and youths at-risk of becoming juvenile offenders in high-poverty, high-crime communities. Each organization may submit only one application for a grant of up to $5 million. Additionally, the department will award a total of $12 million to eight organizations to provide job training for formerly incarcerated individuals of all ages that leads to industry-recognized credentials. Mentoring and assistance connecting to supportive services such as housing, substance abuse and mental health treatment, and assistance with parenting and child reunification, also will be available to participants. These grants are designed to expand opportunities for both youths and adults who demonstrate characteristics most common to female former offenders. However, services must also be open to eligible formerly incarcerated males. Each organization may submit only one application for a grant of up to $1.5 million. ""Expanding access to job training programs and educational opportunities is a proven strategy for reducing recidivism and preventing crime,"" said Attorney General Eric Holder. ""By supporting efforts to help formerly incarcerated women and young adults rebuild their lives – and become productive, law-abiding members of their communities – the departments of Justice and Labor are making good on our shared commitment to improving outcomes and ensuring public safety."" Reintegrating formerly incarcerated individuals is a government-wide effort supported by the Federal Interagency Re-entry Council. Chaired by the U.S. Department of Justice, the council brings together numerous federal agencies to advance policies and programs to make communities safer, assist individuals returning to communities from prison or jail in becoming productive taxpaying citizens, and save taxpayer dollars by lowering the direct and collateral costs of incarceration.

"February 28, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20130228,Norfolk Southern Railway Co. ordered by US Labor Departments OSHA to pay $1.1 million after terminating 3 workers for reporting injuries,"Investigation found violations of Federal Railroad Safety Act whistleblower provisions WASHINGTON – Norfolk Southern Railway Co. has been ordered to pay $1,121,099 to three workers following an investigation by the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which found that the company violated the whistleblower provisions of the Federal Railroad Safety Act. Two investigations, conducted by OSHA staff in Chicago and Pittsburgh, found that three employees were wrongfully fired for reporting workplace injuries. In addition to monetary remedies, the company has been ordered to expunge the disciplinary records of the three whistleblowers, post a notice regarding employees' whistleblower protection rights under the FRSA and train workers on these rights. Railroad carriers are subject to the FRSA, which protects employees who report violations of any federal law, rule or regulation relating to railroad safety or security, or who engage in other protected activities. ""The Labor Department continues to find serious whistleblower violations at Norfolk Southern, and we will be steadfast in our defense of a worker's right to a safe job – including his or her right to report injuries,"" said acting Secretary of Labor Seth D. Harris. ""When workers can't report safety concerns on the job without fear of retaliation, worker safety and health suffer, which costs working families and businesses alike."" One investigation involved a crane operator based in Fort Wayne, Ind., who was removed from service after reporting an eye injury requiring the extraction of a sliver of metal and rust ring from his eye. The injury occurred while he was operating a crane in support of a bridge-building operation in Albany, Ind. The employee was taken out of service and formally terminated on Aug. 24, 2010, after an internal investigation determined he had made false statements concerning the injury. OSHA's investigation concluded that the worker would not have been terminated if he had not reported the injury. The agency has ordered the railroad to pay him a total of $437,591.70 in damages, which includes $100,000 in compensatory damages for pain and suffering, $175,000 in punitive damages, and $156,518.94 in back wages and benefits. It also includes compensation of $6,072.76 to the crane operator for penalties incurred when he had to cash in savings bonds prior to their maturity date after being terminated. In addition to damages, the company has been ordered to pay reasonable attorney fees. Further, OSHA has ordered the railroad to reinstate the worker to the proper seniority level, with vacation and sick days that he would otherwise have earned. OSHA's second investigation involved a thermite welder and a welder's helper based in western Pennsylvania. Both employees had worked at the railroad for more than 36 years without incident when they reported injuries sustained as a result of an accident caused by another vehicle that ran a red light and hit a second vehicle, which in turn collided with the company truck in which they were riding. The employees initially reported minor shoulder area pain plus some stiffness and soreness. Later, when questioned by management, they initially declined medical treatment, but as the pain increased, sought and received treatment at a local hospital. They were then taken out of service pending an investigative hearing and formally terminated. Management concluded that the employees' reports about their condition were false and conflicting and constituted misconduct. OSHA's investigation found that the employees were terminated for reporting injuries to management. The agency has ordered the railroad to pay them $683,508 in damages, including $300,000 in punitive damages; $233,508 in lost wages, benefits and out-of-pocket costs; and $150,000 in compensatory damages for pain and suffering. Interest on back pay due will accrue daily until the employees are paid. In addition to damages, the company has been ordered to pay reasonable attorney fees. These actions follow several other orders issued by OSHA against Norfolk Southern Railway Co. in the past two years. OSHA's investigations have found that the company continues to retaliate against employees for reporting work-related injuries, and these actions have effectively created a chilling effect in the railroad industry. ""The Labor Department's responsibility is to protect all employees, including those in the railroad industry, from retaliation for exercising these basic worker rights,"" said Dr. David Michaels, assistant secretary of labor for occupational safety and health. ""Railroad workers must be able to report work-related injuries without fear of retaliation."" Norfolk Southern Railway Co. is a major transporter/hauler of coal and other commodities, serving every major container port in the eastern United States with connections to western carriers. Its headquarters are in Norfolk, Va., and it employs more than 30,000 union workers worldwide. Any party to these cases can file an appeal with the Labor Department's Office of Administrative Law Judges within 30 days of receipt of the findings. On July 16, 2012, OSHA and the U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Railroad Administration signed a memorandum of agreement to facilitate coordination and cooperation for enforcing the FRSA's whistleblower provisions. Between August 2007, when OSHA was assigned responsibility for whistleblower complaints under the FRSA, and September 2012, OSHA received more than 1,200 FRSA whistleblower complaints. The number of whistleblower complaints that OSHA currently receives under the FRSA surpasses the number it receives under any of the other 21 whistleblower protection statutes it enforces except for Section 11(c) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. More than 60 percent of the FRSA complaints filed with OSHA involve an allegation that a railroad worker has been retaliated against for reporting an on-the-job injury. OSHA enforces the whistleblower provisions of the FRSA and 21 other statutes protecting employees who report violations of various airline, commercial motor carrier, consumer product, environmental, financial reform, food safety, health care reform, nuclear, pipeline, worker safety, public transportation agency, maritime and securities laws. Employers are prohibited from retaliating against employees who raise various protected concerns or provide protected information to the employer or to the government. Employees who believe that they have been retaliated against for engaging in protected conduct may file a complaint with the secretary of labor to request an investigation by OSHA's Whistleblower Protection Program. Detailed information on employee whistleblower rights, including fact sheets, is available at http://www.whistleblowers.gov . Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. OSHA's role is to ensure these conditions for America's working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education and assistance.

"February 28, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ilab/ilab20130228,US Department of Labor presents Iqbal Masih Award to Ghanaian advocate for vulnerable children,"WASHINGTON — Carol Pier, acting deputy undersecretary for the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of International Labor Affairs, today announced that George Achibra of Ghana has won the department's 2012 Iqbal Masih Award for the Elimination of Child Labor. U.S. Ambassador to Ghana Gene A. Cretz presented the award to Achibra at a ceremony in Accra. Achibra was selected for his work in rescuing hundreds of children from child labor and child trafficking in impoverished fishing communities in Ghana. A former schoolteacher, Achibra founded the Partnership for Community Development to provide services to trafficked children and raise awareness about child labor and human trafficking laws. In announcing the award, Pier said, ""Children exploited in Ghana's fishing industry face unacceptable perils — such as drowning because they cannot swim and must dive into deep water to untangle fishing nets. Children trafficked into this industry are especially vulnerable to injury or death. This award honors George Achibra's selfless dedication in helping such children escape from harm and find new hope for their future."" Congress established the Iqbal Masih Award for the Elimination of Child Labor in 2009 to recognize exceptional efforts by an individual, company, organization or national government to end the worst forms of child labor. This non-monetary award honors the spirit of Iqbal Masih, a Pakistani child sold into bonded labor as a carpet weaver at age four. He escaped his servitude and became an outspoken advocate of children's rights, drawing international attention in his fight against child labor. Masih was killed in Pakistan at age 13 in 1995. Since 1995, the Labor Department has supported global efforts to combat exploitative child labor internationally.

Inc. 401(k) plan. The suit alleges that the company, as well as former vice president Mark Isaacs and president Neil Isaacs, violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act by failing to distribute plan assets to participants. “The department is committed to holding accountable those who are entrusted with the assets of workers’ retirement plans,” said Steve Haugen, director of EBSA’s Chicago Regional Office, which conducted the investigation. “We will continue to help workers obtain their rightful benefits when plan fiduciaries violate the law.” The suit alleges that in September 2010, Mark Isaacs, a company vice president and a fiduciary and trustee to the Hico Flex Brass Co. 401(k) plan, redeemed a total of $702,153.99 in assets from the plan to be deposited into company accounts. A total of $622,518.10 in plan assets were distributed to eligible participants from November 2010 to October 2011. As of Sept. 28, 2012, the plan, which had not been terminated, had a total of $79,761.61 in assets remaining to be distributed to 15 eligible participants. The suit seeks to require Mark Isaacs, Neil Isaacs and the company to restore to the Hico Flex Brass Co. 401(k) plan any losses, including lost opportunity costs, resulting from the fiduciary breaches they committed or for which they are liable. The suit also seeks to permanently enjoin them from serving as fiduciaries or service providers to any ERISA-covered plan in the future and to have an independent fiduciary appointed to terminate the plan and distribute its assets to eligible participants.

"February 27, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20130227,Statement by acting Secretary of Labor Seth D. Harris on Americas workers earning at or below the federal minimum wage,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics has released a report titled ""Characteristics of Minimum Wage Workers: 2012."" The report shows that 75.3 million workers in the United States age 16 and over were paid at hourly rates, representing 59 percent of all wage and salary workers. Among those paid by the hour, 1.6 million earned exactly the prevailing federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. About 2 million had wages below the federal minimum. The report also shows that nearly one-half of those earning at or below the federal minimum wage is at least 25 years old, and women make up nearly two-thirds of those earning at or below the federal minimum wage. More than a third of those earning at or below the current federal minimum wage is working full-time. Finally, 15 percent of those earning at or below the federal minimum wage is African-American, and one-fifth is Latino or Hispanic. Acting Secretary of Labor Seth D. Harris has issued the following statement about the report: ""Workers earning the federal minimum wage have not had a raise in nearly four years. As the report makes clear, many are working adults with full-time jobs, and we know that some low-wage workers are holding down more than one job. ""It is an outrage that someone who works full time should have to raise his or her family in poverty. Ensuring hard work is rewarded is the right thing to do for these workers and our economy. That's why the president has called for raising the federal minimum wage to $9.00 per hour by 2015, and indexing it to inflation thereafter. The BLS report looked at only those currently earning at or below the federal minimum wage. According to the White House Council of Economic Advisers, raising the federal minimum wage will result in nearly 15 million low-wage workers getting a raise in their take-home pay. That money will be spent locally at the grocery store, to buy school supplies and clothing for children, to pay rent and utility bills, and in many other ways to support families. ""In fiscal year 2012, the department's Wage and Hour Division found minimum wage violations in more than 12,500 investigations – more than a third of all cases concluded by the agency that fiscal year. These cases resulted in $35.2 million in back minimum wages for more than 107,000 workers, more than twice what we recovered in similar investigations in fiscal year 2009. Unfortunately, our ability to enforce the law and protect our most vulnerable workers will be threatened if Congress fails to act to avert the coming sequester. ""Over the next few weeks, our economy, national security and services that are important to middle-class families will be affected by automatic, arbitrary and irresponsible cuts if Congress fails to act. The president has offered a compromise plan. Congress must act immediately."" Read the BLS report at http://www.bls.gov/cps/minwage2012.htm . Editor's note : The previous version of this statement incorrectly reported the number of women earning at or below the federal minimum wage."

The company was performing guard rail and sign installation for a 13-mile stretch of I-94 in western Wisconsin under contract with the Wisconsin Department of Transportation when the incident occurred on Sept. 17, 2012. Citations have been issued for six instance-by-instance willful violations of failing to ensure that parts of the equipment being operated were not within 10 feet of a power line, exposing workers to electrical shock and electrocution hazards. These citations also include instances of failing to ensure that any part of the machinery was not within 6 feet of an overhead power line while the machinery was traveling beneath the power lines. A willful violation is one committed with intentional, knowing or voluntary disregard for the law's requirement, or plain indifference to employee safety and health. ""Highway Technologies failed to protect its workers from serious electrocution hazards,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health Dr. David Michaels. ""Multiple instances of the same violation over a period of time clearly demonstrate a willful failure to comply with basic safety and health standards. Employers must take steps to eliminate hazards and provide a safe working environment."" Due to the nature of the hazards and the violations cited, Highway Technologies Inc. has been placed in OSHA's Severe Violator Enforcement Program, which mandates targeted follow-up inspections to ensure future compliance with the law. OSHA's program focuses on recalcitrant employers that endanger workers by committing willful, repeat or failure-to-abate violations. Under the program, OSHA may inspect any of the employer's facilities if it has reasonable grounds to believe there are similar violations. Four serious violations also cited include failing to identify electrical work zones, determine if any part of the equipment being operated would be closer than 20 feet of a power line, train each worker on safe clearance distances from power lines, and evaluate that each employee understood the training and risks of working near overhead power lines. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known. Highway Technologies Inc., headquartered in Houston, employs about 1,500 workers in 13 states installing highway guardrails, crash attenuators, barrier walls and signage. Prior to this investigation, the company had been inspected by OSHA 10 times since 2007, resulting in citations for nine serious violations. One of these inspections was initiated based on employee injuries sustained from contacting an overhead power line while installing a highway sign. Proposed penalties for citations issued following this current investigation total $448,000. The citations can be viewed at http://www.osha.gov/ooc/citations/Highway_Technologies_Inc._640558_02-26-2013.pdf . The company has 15 business days from receipt of its citations and penalties to comply, request an informal conference with OSHA's area director or contest the findings before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. To ask questions, obtain compliance assistance, file a complaint, or report workplace hospitalizations, fatalities or situations posing imminent danger to workers, the public should call OSHA's toll-free hotline at 800-321-OSHA (6742) or the agency's Eau Claire Area Office at 715-832-9019. Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees.

"February 27, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20130227,US Labor Department recovers more than $43 million for Madoff victims,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor has reached a settlement that provides for payment of more than $34 million to compensate employee benefit plans for losses suffered through investments in funds managed by Austin Capital Management, which indirectly invested in Bernard L. Madoff’s Ponzi scheme. The agreement follows an earlier settlement with Austin Capital’s parent company, KeyCorp, for more than $9 million. Recoveries from both settlements total more than $43 million for plan investors in funds managed by Austin Capital. “This settlement will benefit thousands of workers and retirees whose hard-earned retirement savings and health plans were affected by Bernard Madoff,” said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Employee Benefits Security Phyllis C. Borzi. The settlement, with Austin Capital Management Ltd. and its general partner, Austin Capital Management GP Corp., involves employee benefit plans’ investments in certain funds managed by Austin Capital Management. Those funds invested a percentage of their assets in the Rye Select Broad Market Prime Fund L.P. offered by Tremont Partners Inc. (the “BMP Fund”) which, in turn, was 100 percent invested with Bernard L. Madoff. Under the settlement agreement announced today, $34,363,636 will be paid to a settlement fund for the plan investors. In the settlement entered into on Dec. 13, 2012, KeyCorp, Austin Capital’s parent company, paid $9,090,909 to a settlement fund for plans that invested with Austin funds, for a total recovery for the plans of $43,454,545. The money in both settlement funds will be distributed to the plans by an independent fiduciary selected by the department. Austin Capital Management also will pay a civil penalty of $4,345,455. Based on its investigation, the department contended that Austin Capital violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act by causing or permitting certain funds to imprudently invest the assets of ERISA-covered plans with Madoff through investments in the BMP Fund. The funds involved were the Austin Safe Harbor ERISA Dedicated Fund, Safe Harbor Portable Alpha Offshore Fund One, Safe Harbor Portable Alpha Offshore Fund Two, Safe Harbor Offshore Fund, All Seasons Qualified Purchaser Fund, All Seasons Offshore Fund and the Balanced Offshore Fund. The settlement resulted from an investigation conducted by the Labor Department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration’s Dallas Regional Office with the assistance of the department’s Office of the Solicitor, Plan Benefits Security Division, in Washington.

"February 26, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ofccp/ofccp20130226,US Labor Department rescinds restrictions on investigating pay discrimination,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Labor today announced that its Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs is rescinding two enforcement guidance documents on pay discrimination originally issued in 2006, commonly known as the ""Compensation Standards"" and ""Voluntary Guidelines.""This action, to be effective Feb. 28, is intended to protect workers and strengthen OFCCP's ability to identify and remedy different forms of pay discrimination. It will enable OFCCP to conduct investigations of contractor pay practices consistent with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. ""A strong American middle class hinges on ensuring equal pay,"" said acting Secretary of Labor Seth D. Harris. ""As President Obama has made clear, everyone including the wives, mothers, sisters and daughters among us must be paid fairly and without discrimination. These new standards will strengthen our ability to ensure that women and men are fully protected under our nation's laws."" The notice of final rescission withdrawing these two documents also includes new guidance for employers and other interested stakeholders setting forth the procedures, analysis and protocols OFCCP will utilize going forward when conducting compensation discrimination investigations. OFCCP will supplement the guidance with frequently asked questions, technical assistance, webinars, and other resources and materials to ensure that contractors have ample information about how to comply with the law. ""Today, we are lifting arbitrary barriers that have prevented our investigators from finding and combating illegal pay discrimination,"" said OFCCP Director Patricia A. Shiu, a member of the President's National Equal Pay Task Force. ""At the same time, we are providing clear guidance for contractors to facilitate their success when it comes to providing equal opportunity to all of their workers."" The new approach described in the notice will enable OFCCP investigators to better examine practices and available evidence to uncover discrimination and evaluate contractor compliance with Executive Order 11246. That longstanding executive order requires federal contractors to comply with antidiscrimination obligations, including prohibitions against pay discrimination. Prior to this action, OFCCP was constrained by a methodology adopted in 2006 that made it harder for the agency to exercise its full legal authority because it required use of the same narrow formula to review all contractor pay practices, regardless of the industry, types of jobs, issues presented or available data. Now, OFCCP will be using its legal authority to hold contractors to the same legal standards enshrined in Title VII, the landmark civil rights law that courts and other federal agencies already apply to these businesses to prohibit job discrimination. For more information, including copies of the notice of final rescission and supporting materials, visit http://www.dol.gov/ofccp/compguidance. In addition to Executive Order 11246, OFCCP enforces Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974. As amended, these three laws require those who do business with the federal government, both contractors and subcontractors, to follow the fair and reasonable standard that they not discriminate in employment on the basis of sex, race, color, religion, national origin, disability or status as a protected veteran."

"February 22, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20130222,"US Labor Departments OSHA announces interim final rule, invites public comment on whistleblower protections for reporting violations of Affordable Care Acts health insurance reforms","WASHINGTON The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration has published an interim final rule in the Federal Register that governs whistleblower complaints filed under Section 1558 of the Affordable Care Act. The Affordable Care Act contains various provisions to make health insurance more affordable and accountable to consumers. Among the policies to achieve its goals, the Affordable Care Act's Section 1558 provides protection to employees against retaliation by an employer for reporting alleged violations of Title I of the act or for receiving a tax credit or cost-sharing reduction as a result of participating in a Health Insurance Exchange or Marketplace. Title I includes a range of insurance company accountability policies, such as the prohibition of lifetime limits on coverage and exclusions due to pre-existing conditions. If an employee reports a violation of one of these policies or requirements, the act's whistleblower provision prohibits employers from retaliating against the employee. If an employee is retaliated against in violation of the whistleblower provision, he or she may file a complaint with, and ultimately receive relief from, OSHA or the courts. The Affordable Care Act authorizes the secretary of labor to conduct investigations into complaints and issue determinations, which are functions delegated to OSHA. OSHA's interim final rule establishes the procedures and time frames for the filing and handling of such complaints, including investigations by OSHA, appeals of OSHA determinations to an administrative law judge for a hearing, review of such decisions by the Administrative Review Board and judicial review of the secretary's final decision. The interim final rule can be viewed at www.dol.gov/find/20130222/ . Comments, which will be accepted for 60 days, may be submitted electronically via the federal e-rulemaking portal at http://www.regulations.gov , or by mail or fax. Faxed submissions, including attachments, must not exceed 10 pages and should be sent to the OSHA Docket Office at 202-693-1648. Comments submitted by mail should be addressed to the OSHA Docket Office, Docket No. OSHA – 2011-0193, U.S. Department of Labor, Room N-2625, 200 Constitution Ave. NW, Washington, DC 20210. A fact sheet about filing whistleblower complaints under the Affordable Care Act is available at http://www.osha.gov/Publications/whistleblower/OSHAFS-3641.pdf . OSHA enforces the whistleblower provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 and 21 other statutes protecting employees who report reasonably perceived violations of various workplace, commercial motor vehicle, airline, nuclear, pipeline, environmental, railroad, public transportation, maritime, consumer product, motor vehicle safety, health care reform, corporate securities, food safety, and consumer financial reform laws and regulations. Additional information is available at http://www.whistleblowers.gov . The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services today also issued a final rule that implements five key consumer protections from the Affordable Care Act and makes the health insurance market work better for individuals, families and small businesses. For more information, visit http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2013pres/02/20130222a.html . Under the OSH Act, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees.

"February 21, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20130221-0,US Labor Department obtains $80 million for participants in Sherwin-Williams Employee Stock Purchase and Savings Plan,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor has reached a settlement with the Cleveland-based Sherwin-Williams Co. that will provide $80 million to current and past participants of its Employee Stock Purchase and Savings Plan. The agreement is the result of an investigation by the department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration into whether Sherwin-Williams, seeking to take advantage of tax breaks, improperly managed the plan in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The settlement also requires Illinois-based GreatBanc Trust Co. to undergo an audit of its pension plan activities. “Those who manage retirement plan assets are in a special position of trust and are required by law to always put the interests of plan participants ahead of anything else. That did not happen in this situation,” said acting Secretary of Labor Seth D. Harris. “This agreement rightfully restores money to the workers who’ve played by the rules, done the right thing and worked hard to save for a secure retirement.” Said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Employee Benefits Security Phyllis C. Borzi, “When fiduciaries expend retirement plan assets, they have to act with undivided loyalty to the plan participants and make sure that the plan receives full value for its money. The fiduciaries’ job is to manage plan investments to provide a secure retirement, not to help the plan sponsor secure tax breaks that are wholly disproportionate to the benefits actually provided to retirees.” The department’s investigation focused on two transactions, one in 2003 and one in 2006, in which Sherwin-Williams and GreatBanc caused the plan to purchase specially designed stock issued by Sherwin-Williams solely for the purpose of the transactions. The investigation also looked at whether Sherwin-Williams had forwarded employee salary deferrals appropriately and promptly to their individual plan accounts. After conducting its investigation, the department concluded that, as a result of Sherwin-Williams’ and GreatBanc’s violations of their fiduciary duties and the design of the transactions, the stock purchases did not provide benefits to the plan and its participants commensurate with the amount the plan paid for the stock, the transactions were not primarily for the purpose of providing benefits to plan participants, the transactions did not promote employee ownership of Sherwin-Williams and, at times, employee salary deferrals were not appropriately paid to the plan. As a result, the department concluded, Sherwin-Williams and GreatBanc were responsible and liable for violations of ERISA. The department found that Sherwin-Williams’ purpose in the transactions was to take advantage of substantial tax benefits designed to reward companies that provide their workers with significant stock ownership while, at the same time, ensuring that its employees did not actually receive stock or retirement benefits in amounts close to what the plan spent on the transactions or that the company claimed on its government filings. In October 2011, Sherwin-Williams reached a settlement with the Internal Revenue Service in connection with the transactions for excise tax and penalty claims. The IRS settlement did not address violations of fiduciary duty under ERISA or resolve the department’s concerns relating to Sherwin-Williams’ use of employee salary deferrals. The settlement will result in payments totaling $80 million to current and former plan participants as well as to their beneficiaries. In addition, GreatBanc will audit its engagements involving plan investments in employer stock and submit a full report of that audit to the department. As of Dec. 31, 2011, the date of the most recent Form 5500 filing, the plan had participants of 34,591 and assets of $2,496,931,983. The settlement resulted from a comprehensive investigation conducted by EBSA’s Cincinnati Regional Office with assistance from the Plan Benefits Security Division of the department’s Office of the Solicitor of Labor.

The investigation, conducted primarily in Spanish by bilingual Wage and Hour investigators, determined that Meyer's Family Restaurant failed to compensate workers with overtime pay at time and one-half their regular rates of pay for hours worked beyond 40 in a week, as required by the FLSA. The company also failed to record all hours worked by employees, paid cash for some hours, and kept no record of those hours worked, the cash payments made, or the tips received. ""Food Service workers often work long hours in physically demanding occupations. These workers deserve to be paid properly,"" said Theresa Walls, director of the Wage and Hour Division's Minneapolis District Office. ""The resolution of this case should remind employers that the department will not hesitate to investigate if they deny workers their rightful pay. We are committed to protecting the many vulnerable workers employed in the restaurant industry and will vigorously pursue violators to ensure compliance with the law."" The company has agreed to comply with the FLSA, to pay the back wages due in full and to implement a system to monitor payroll for overtime hours in the future. The FLSA requires that covered, nonexempt employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 for all hours worked, plus time and one-half their regular rates of pay for hours worked beyond 40 per week. In accordance with the FLSA, an employer of a tipped employee is required to pay no less than $2.13 an hour in direct wages, provided that amount plus the tips received equals at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. If an employee's tips combined with the employer's direct wages do not equal the minimum wage, the employer must make up the difference. Employers also are required to provide employees notice of the FLSA tip credit provisions, to maintain accurate time and payroll records and to comply with the hours, hazardous orders and other restrictions applying to workers under age 18.

""As President Obama said in his State of the Union address, 'to grow our middle class, our citizens must have access to the education and training that today's jobs require,'"" said acting Secretary of Labor Seth D. Harris. ""Trade Adjustment Assistance enables workers to pursue training in the skills that today's employers need, contributing not just to a stronger middle class, but to a stronger American economy."" This TAA certification was based on a Labor Department investigation to determine whether the layoff event met the group eligibility criteria set forth by the Trade Act of 1974. An investigation found that increased imports of baked products contributed importantly to the company's sales declines and worker separations. Workers covered by this TAA certification will be contacted by their respective state workforce agencies with instructions on how to apply for individual benefits and services. Those who qualify may receive case management and re-employment services, training in new occupational skills and/or trade readjustment allowances that provide income support for workers enrolled in training. Workers may also receive job search and relocation allowances, and the Health Coverage Tax Credit. While TAA is open to eligible workers of all ages, workers 50 years of age and older may elect to receive Re-employment Trade Adjustment Assistance instead. If a worker obtains new employment at wages less than $50,000 and less than those earned in the trade-impacted employment, the RTAA program will pay 50 percent of the difference between the old wage and the new wage, up to $10,000 over a two-year period. RTAA participants may also be eligible for retraining and the HCTC.

The employer has been the subject of a previous Wage and Hour Division investigation, which disclosed similar MSPA violations. ""These vulnerable migrant farm workers performed intense physical labor, planting and harvesting crops, but in turn were denied their rightful wages and many even suffered unsafe housing conditions,"" said James Schmidt, director of the Wage and Hour Division's Tampa District Office. ""The safety and well-being of farm workers is a top priority for the department. We are pleased these workers will finally be paid the wages they are owed, and we expect that this time San-Way Farms will stay true to its commitment to maintaining future compliance with the law."" A team of investigators from the division's Tampa District Office visited the farming operation and conducted thorough inspections of migrant housing units and vehicles, reviewed payroll records, employment practices, and conducted employee interviews in English and Spanish to assess compliance with all applicable agricultural labor standards. Investigators found many San-Way Farms employees, such as those hired to hand-harvest strawberries, were paid piece-rate wages varying from $1.75 to $3 per flat, or container, of picked crops. The employer failed to keep daily and weekly time records when employees were paid on a piece-rate basis; these employees were not paid for all hours worked, causing some employees' wages to fall below the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour required by the Fair Labor Standards Act. Significant MSPA violations were also found at the farm, including failure to pay wages when due; failure to disclose employment terms and conditions to workers in a language they could understand at time of recruitment; failure to provide requisite wage statements; and failure to make and maintain legally required payroll records. The employer also failed to meet federal health and safety standards for migrant worker housing facilities, as required under the MSPA. San-Way Farms contracted with Silver Lane, LLC a MSPA-covered housing provider, to lease trailers that served as temporary housing facilities for its migrant agricultural workers. Inspections of these housing facilities disclosed violations, such as broken windows and screens, inadequate drainage and lack of ventilation and protection against the elements. As a result of these violations, the department has also assessed Silver Lane, LLC $3,150 in civil money penalties. San-Way Farms and owner Moss signed a settlement agreement with the department committing to future compliance and agreeing to pay all back wages and civil money penalties owed. The employer also indicated that it plans to install and utilize a new electronic timekeeping system to properly track work hours and ensure accurate payment of wages, in accordance with the law. This investigation was conducted under a multiyear enforcement initiative aimed at strengthening compliance with labor laws in Central Florida's agricultural industry. Under this initiative, the division's Tampa District Office conducted 144 investigations of agricultural industry employers in 2012, recovering more than $135,000 in back wages for 926 workers and assessing approximately $228,000 in civil money penalties. The division also conducted more than 40 outreach sessions, providing valuable education and compliance assistance to hundreds of employers, employees and stakeholders regarding the requirements of the law. For more information about the initiative, see the division's Jan. 14 press release at http://www.dol.gov/whd/media/press/whdpressVB3.asp?pressdoc=Southeast/20130114.xml . Accessible and searchable information on enforcement activities by the department is available at http://ogesdw.dol.gov/search. Most agricultural employers, agricultural associations and farm labor contractors are subject to the MSPA, which provides additional protections for migrant and seasonal agricultural workers by establishing employment standards related to wages, housing, transportation, disclosures and record keeping.

"February 14, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20130214,"Lyons Group to pay $424,000 in back wages and liquidated damages to 409 underpaid workers at 15 well-known Boston restaurants","Patrick Lyons to alert fellow restaurateurs of need to pay proper wages BOSTON — A group of 15 Boston-area restaurants and their owners, Patrick Lyons and Edward Sparks, have agreed to pay $424,000 — including $212,000 in back wages and an equal amount in liquidated damages — to 409 employees to resolve alleged violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act identified by the U.S. Department of Labor. Lyons will also issue a public statement warning his fellow restaurant owners of the hazards of using contract labor providers who do not comply with the FLSA. Investigations by the department's Wage and Hour Division found that employees of the following restaurants were not properly compensated for all work hours: Alibi Bar & Lounge; Back Bay Social Club; Bleacher Bar; The Estate; Game On; Harvard Gardens; Kings Boston; Kings Dedham; La Verdad; The Lansdowne Pub; Lucky's Lounge; Scampo; Sonsie; Sweetwater Café; and Towne Stove & Spirits. Many of these employees were paid straight time wages rather than time and one-half their regular rates of pay for hours worked in excess of 40 in a workweek, as required by the FLSA. The bulk of the underpayments affected Lyons Group kitchen staff, who were paid by Superbrite Professional Cleaning, a separate company, later known as Excel Management. ""Utilizing contract labor providers does not absolve employers from their responsibility of complying with the FLSA and paying workers the wages they are legally due,"" said George Rioux, district director for the Wage and Hour Division in Boston. ""The use of contract labor providers in the restaurant industry has increased over the past several years, along with violations. Employers have a choice. Put these workers on payroll or ensure their labor providers are paying their employees in compliance with the FLSA."" ""Employers should be aware that, as a general rule, they will pay twice when they underpay their employees. The department will seek not only the back wages due the workers, but an equal amount in liquidated damages on their behalf,"" said Michael Felsen, the department's regional solicitor for New England, whose office negotiated the settlements. ""The time has come for the restaurant industry in Massachusetts to address this issue seriously. Underpaying employees not only hurts workers, it undercuts those employers who have chosen to obey the law in the first place."" As part of enhanced settlement agreements reached with the department, the Lyons Group will audit each restaurant's current compliance with the FLSA and take other steps to prevent violations. This will include developing and implementing a software program designed to detect employees who work in two or more of the restaurants during the same workweek. The investigations were conducted under the division's multiyear enforcement initiative focused on the restaurant industry in Massachusetts, where widespread noncompliance with the FLSA's minimum wage, overtime and record-keeping provisions has been found. The restaurant industry employs some of our country's lowest-paid workers who are vulnerable to disparate treatment and labor violations. In addition to the initiative in Massachusetts, the Wage and Hour Division has other ongoing enforcement initiatives throughout the U.S. to identify and remedy violations that are common in the restaurant industry . The FLSA requires that covered employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, as well as time and one-half their regular rates for hours worked over 40 per week. The law also requires employers to maintain accurate records of employees' wages, hours and other conditions of employment, and prohibits employers from retaliating against employees who exercise their rights under the law. The FLSA provides that employers who violate the law are, as a general rule, liable to employees for back wages and an equal amount in liquidated damages. Information on establishments investigated under the ongoing restaurant initiative will be included in the division's enforcement database, which can be viewed online at http://www.dol.gov/whd/ . Businesses will have a greater incentive to comply with the law now that their compliance track records are publicly available. For more information about the requirements of the FLSA, contact the Wage and Hour Division's Boston District Office at 617-624-6700 or the division's toll-free helpline at 866-4US-WAGE (487-9243).

Tomco Auto Products, Inc. involving summary judgment and default judgment of Tomco Auto Products, Inc. in Los Angeles, Calif.","Date of Action: Jan. 31, 2013 Type of Action: Motions for Summary Judgment and Entry of Default Judgment Names of Defendants: Richard Alan Schoenfeld and Tomco Auto Products, Inc. Allegations: Plan fiduciaries improperly withdrew $197,000 from the plan in late 2004, and used the money to pay the financial obligations of Tomco Auto Products, Inc. Plan fiduciaries failed to repay $47,000 in principal plus $22,511.36 in lost earnings to the plan. Resolution: The secretary filed a Motion for Entry of Default Judgment against defendant Tomco Auto Products, Inc. for failing to respond to the secretary’s complaint, and also filed a Motion for Summary Judgment against Tomco and Richard Alan Schoenfeld. The court found that Tomco and Schoenfeld were jointly and severally liable to restore losses to the plan and enjoined Tomco and Schoenfeld from serving as plan fiduciaries, stating, “. . . in light of the serious misconduct on the part of [Tomco and Schoenfeld] in misusing Plan funds, the Court finds appropriate equitable relief to include a permanent injunction against [Tomco and Schoenfeld] from serving as fiduciaries . . . .” The court also ordered the appointment of an independent fiduciary to manage the plan going forward, and awarded post-judgment interest to the secretary on behalf of the plan. Schoenfeld’s debt to the plan is non-dischargeable under Section 523(a)(4) of the Bankruptcy Code, the court ruled, because he misappropriated trust funds while acting in a fiduciary capacity.

"February 14, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20130214-0,"US Department of Labor files suit to recover an additional $57,000 for workers in five Nashville, TN, area retirement plans","NASHVILLE, Tenn. – The U.S. Department of Labor has filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee against Aaron Donald Vallett and his wholly-owned company, A.D. Vallett & Co. LLC, which provided third-party administrative services to a number of retirement plans in the Nashville area. The company also provided brokerage services and financial advice to a number of individual and corporate clients. In its complaint the department alleges that in December 2009 and January 2010, in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, Vallett illegally removed money from participant accounts in five retirement plans he administered and placed it into his company’s general operating fund. Vallett used the money for personal expenses and to pay his company’s operating expenses. The total amount stolen was $888,237.69. The department further alleges that Vallett falsified the plans’ records by indicating that the withdrawals had been placed in outside brokerage accounts. As such, it appeared that the funds were still in the plans. After the unauthorized withdrawals were discovered, Vallett met with a number of the plan trustees and asked them to sign a form that would allow for the funds to be placed back into the plans and a form that indicated that they had authorized the withdrawals. A receiver for the assets of Vallet’s terminated company was appointed by the court in August 2010. The receiver proceeded to file a claim against Vallet’s insurer in the amount withdrawn from the five retirement plans. Although the full amount stolen from the plans was restored in August 2011, lost earnings and interest on these funds were not restored. Accordingly, the department seeks approximately $57,606.01 in lost earnings and interest, and a permanent injunction against Vallett from acting in a future fiduciary capacity to any ERISA-covered plans. “Although the assets taken from plan participant accounts were restored, the gains that could have been made on these investments were not,” said Isabel Colon, director for the Employee Benefits Security Administration’s Atlanta regional office. “Today’s action is to ensure that those retirement savers receive all of what is rightfully theirs.” Vallett has been criminally prosecuted by the Department of Justice for four counts of theft from an ERISA plan. On July 9, Vallett entered a guilty plea for all counts. On Oct. 1, he was sentenced to 120 months in prison, three years of supervised release and was ordered to pay restitution to his company’s insurer in the amount of $888,237.69. Additionally, in the same criminal action, Vallett was also prosecuted for and pleaded guilty to six counts of mail fraud and six counts of wire fraud. He was ordered to pay restitution to the victims of his crimes for their losses totaling $4,604,311.08. In total, Vallett has been ordered to pay $5,492,548.77 in restitution. Vallet formed his company in April 2006. Among the retirement plans that the company provided services to were Mephisto Inc. 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan and Trust; Wiley Group Inc. 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan and Trust; Southeastern Building Corp. 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan and Trust; Timothy E. McNutt Sr., D.D.S., 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan and Trust; and Project C.A.M.P. 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan and Trust.

"February 13, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20130213,US Department of Labor files discrimination lawsuit against Diamond Tree Experts in Salt Lake City,"Investigation found employee terminated for refusing to return wages earned SALT LAKE CITY — The U.S. Department of Labor has filed a lawsuit against Diamond Tree Experts Inc. after an investigation by the Wage and Hour Division found that the company violated the Fair Labor Standards Act by discriminating against employees for exercising their rights under the law. A previous investigation by the division's Salt Lake City District Office found that Diamond Tree Experts, a tree-trimming and stump-removal company, paid straight-time for all hours worked rather than overtime compensation at time and one-half employees' regular rates of pay for hours worked over 40 in a workweek, as required by the FLSA. Investigators found that Diamond Tree Experts paid the back wages found due in that investigation, but then required employees to return the funds to the company. When one of the employees refused to do so, they were terminated. ""Two employees who were paid more than $7,500 in overtime back wages following our initial investigation were instructed to reimburse the company for the wages they rightfully earned,"" said Cynthia Watson, regional administrator for the Wage and Hour Division in the Southwest. ""Requiring the return of an employee's earnings, and retaliation of the employee, is illegal and unacceptable. This lawsuit should send a clear message to employers who consider such tactics. The department will use whatever enforcement tools are necessary, including litigation, to ensure that workers receive and keep the wages they have earned, and to ensure that employers who blatantly ignore the law are brought to justice."" The complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of Utah in Salt Lake City against Diamond Tree Experts Inc. and it owner, Robert Trent Van Dam. The lawsuit seeks injunctive relief, back wages, liquidated damages, reinstatement and other damages to be determined. The FLSA requires that covered, nonexempt employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour for all hours worked, plus time and one-half their regular rates of pay, including commissions, bonuses and incentive pay, for hours worked beyond 40 per week. Employers also are required to maintain accurate time and payroll records. The FLSA also contains a nonretaliation clause that protects workers from retaliation for exercising their rights under the FLSA. Any employee who is discharged or in any other manner discriminated against because, for instance, he has filed a complaint or cooperated in an investigation, may file a retaliation complaint with the Wage and Hour Division or may file a private cause of action seeking appropriate remedies including, but not limited to, employment, reinstatement, lost wages and an additional equal amount as liquidated damages.

Judge James Knoll Gardner of the U.S District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania entered a consent judgment and order against the company, which agreed to the terms. The workers, who were hired to respond to text messages from customers, were home workers located throughout the United States. The company headquarters for kgb USA is in Bethlehem, Pa. The consent judgment and order resolve an investigation by the U.S. Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division that found the company misclassified employees as independent contractors and paid them a piece rate based on the numbers of text messages and inquiries they responded to, without regard to the number of hours they worked. FLSA violations resulted when piece rate earnings failed to yield at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. ""Misclassification of workers as independent contractors is a serious threat to their livelihood. Misclassifying workers also undercuts responsible employers who must compete with unscrupulous employers who do not obey the law,"" said acting Secretary of Labor Seth D. Harris. ""The Department of Labor is committed to ensuring that employees are classified properly so that they receive both the pay they rightfully earn and the protections to which they are entitled — including minimum and overtime wages, family and medical leave, and unemployment insurance."" The investigation also revealed that the company failed to record and maintain accurate records of employees' hours worked, in violation of FLSA record-keeping requirements. Under the terms of the consent judgment, the company is ordered to pay the back wages found due in full and is enjoined from violating the FLSA in the future.

"February 11, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20130211,Statement by acting Secretary Seth D. Harris regarding proposed Unemployment Insurance legislation in North Carolina,"WASHINGTON – Acting Secretary of Labor Seth D. Harris today issued the following statement regarding North Carolina House of Representatives Bill 4: ""The North Carolina legislature is considering legislation that would reduce state Unemployment Insurance benefits. If enacted, the legislation also would cut off all federally funded Emergency Unemployment Compensation – that is, benefits after 26 weeks of unemployment – to 170,000 unemployed North Carolinians. This cutoff is automatic under federal law. I have no discretion to stop it. As a result, families struggling to secure their place in the middle class will suffer a grievous blow, and the state's economy will lose $780 million in federal funds that are vital to reducing North Carolina's high unemployment rate. ""We know that for every dollar spent on Unemployment Insurance benefits, nearly two dollars are generated in the local economy. Unemployed workers and their families spend these benefits in local grocery stores and small businesses, and use them to stay current on mortgage or rent payments and utilities. For these reasons, UI programs are vital to economic growth in difficult times, particularly in states like North Carolina with high unemployment rates."""
"February 11, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20130211,"US Labor Departments OSHA cites Jacksonville, Fla.-based Bacardi Bottling following death of temporary worker on 1st day","JACKSONVILLE, Fla. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration has cited Bacardi Bottling Corp. with 12 alleged safety violations following the death of a 21-year-old temporary worker his first day on the job. Lawrence Daquan ""Day"" Davis was crushed to death by a palletizer machine at the Jacksonville facility in August 2012. The company uses Remedy Intelligent Staffing as a temporary staffing service to provide laborers for certain types of jobs. ""A worker's first day at work shouldn't be his last day on earth,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health Dr. David Michaels. ""Employers are responsible for ensuring the safe conditions of all their employees, including those who are temporary."" OSHA requires that employers protect the health and safety of all workers under their supervision and control. Davis was cleaning glass from under the hoist of a palletizing machine when an employee restarted the palletizer. Bacardi Bottling had failed to train temporary employees on utilizing locks and tags to prevent the accidental start-up of machines and to ensure its own employees utilized procedures to lock or tag out machines. Two willful citations have been issued for failing to develop, document and utilize lockout/tagout procedures for the control of potentially hazardous energy and train temporary workers on lockout/tagout procedures. A willful violation is one committed with intentional knowing or voluntary disregard for the law's requirements or with plain indifference to worker safety and health. ""We are seeing untrained workers – many of them temporary workers – killed very soon after starting a new job. This must stop,"" said Michaels. ""Employers must train all employees, including temporary workers, on the hazards specific to that workplace – before they start working. Had Bacardi done so, this tragic loss of life could have been prevented."" Also cited are nine serious violations for exposing workers to trips, struck-by and fire hazards where fixed permanent conveyors crossed through the aisle; obstructing exit routes; exposing workers to falling bottles and debris from overhead conveyors and electrical shock hazards. The employer also failed to provide an adequate number of lockout/tagout devices to perform lockout/tagout procedures of energy sources on various equipment, conduct an adequate periodic review of the energy control procedures, perform servicing and maintenance on machines and equipment without training in the methods and means for energy isolation, and require workers to wear safety goggles and long sleeves when using air guns at 90 pounds per square inch. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known. One other-than-serious violation has been cited for storing a mixing tank within 12 inches of the electrical panel box. An other-than-serious violation is one that has a direct relationship to job safety and health, but probably would not cause death or serious physical harm. Proposed penalties for the willful and serious violations total $192,000. The citations can be viewed at http://www.osha.gov/ooc/citations/BacardiBottlingCorp_584358_0208_13.pdf . Bacardi Bottling has 15 business days from receipt of the citations and proposed penalties to comply, request a conference with OSHA's area director or contest the findings before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. To ask questions, obtain compliance assistance, file a complaint, or report workplace hospitalizations, fatalities or situations posing imminent danger to workers, the public should call OSHA's toll-free hotline at 800-321-OSHA (6742) or the agency's Jacksonville Area Office at 904-232-2895. Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. OSHA's role is to ensure these conditions for America's working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education and assistance.

Funds will be used to provide career training and employment and supportive services to improve economic opportunities for migrant and seasonal farmworkers and their families. ""Farmworkers – harvesting and packaging the vegetables and fruits that feed a nation – are vital to our economy. These Labor Department grants will be an investment that benefits not only these workers but all of us,"" said acting Secretary Seth D. Harris. The National Farmworker Jobs Program helps farmworkers upgrade their agricultural job skills or acquire new skills in industries that offer higher wages and more stable employment. In addition, the program provides supportive services such as child care, housing assistance and transportation, which remove barriers to farmworkers pursuing training, and enable them to begin new careers or retain their employment. Eligible applicants include, but are not limited to, community-based organizations and public agencies that assist farmworkers and their families in attaining greater economic stability. A total of approximately $9.6 million is available for grants to operate the program in central California, Hawaii, Indiana, Michigan, Mississippi, New Jersey and Puerto Rico. The National Farmworker Jobs Program is authorized by Congress in Section 167 of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 to counter the impact of chronic unemployment and underemployment experienced by migrant and seasonal farmworkers who depend primarily on agricultural jobs. The solicitation for grant applications, which includes information about how to apply, is available at http://www.grants.gov .

"February 5, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20130205,US Labor Department marks 20th anniversary of Family and Medical Leave Act,"New rule announced benefitting military families and airline flight crews WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Labor today marked the 20th anniversary of the signing of the Family and Medical Leave Act by issuing a final rule implementing two important expansions of FMLA protections. The first expansion provides families of eligible veterans with the same job-protected FMLA leave currently available to families of military service members and it also enables more military families to take leave for activities that arise when a service member is deployed. The second expansion modifies existing rules so that airline personnel and flight crews are better able to make use of the FMLA's protections. ""Enabling our military families to care for their loved ones without fear of losing their job and to actively participate in deployment, reunification and recovery reflects our deeper understanding of the role family members have in sustaining an all-volunteer force. Today's rule makes clear this administration's strong, ongoing commitment to respond to the needs and sacrifices of our military families. The rule also helps ensure that pilots and flight crews will no longer need to choose between career and caring for a loved one,"" said acting Secretary of Labor Seth D. Harris. The rule, being expanded today, implemented congressional amendments to the FMLA permitting eligible workers to take up to 26 workweeks of leave to care for a current service member with a serious injury or illness. Congress also created qualifying exigency leave, which permits eligible employees to take up to 12 workweeks of leave for qualifying exigencies arising out of active duty or call to active duty in support of a contingency operation of a family member serving in the National Guard or Reserve. This means that workers can attend a spouse's farewell and welcome home ceremonies without being penalized at work. They also can spend time with family members on leave from active duty service without risking their jobs. The final rule also implements amendments clarifying the application of the FMLA to airline personnel and flight crews. Until the amendments, many flight crews did not meet FMLA eligibility criteria due to the unique way in which their hours are counted. The legislation authorized the department to tailor FMLA regulations that extend protections to these uniquely situated employees. For more information, including the rule, a military leave guide, fact sheets and other materials, visit http://www.dol.gov/whd/fmla/2013rule . The final rule announced today will have tremendous benefits for workers, employers and families. The FMLA, enacted in 1993, entitles eligible employees of covered employers to take unpaid, job-protected leave for specified family and medical reasons.

Titled ""Family and Medical Leave Act in 2012: Final Report,"" the survey shows that the law has had a positive effect on the lives of millions of workers and their families without imposing an undue burden on employers. ""The Family and Medical Leave Act codified a simple and fundamental principle: Workers should not have to choose between the job they need and the family members they love and who need their care,"" said acting Secretary of Labor Seth D. Harris. ""The FMLA has helped millions upon millions of working families manage challenging personal circumstances at very little cost to their employers and with very little disruption in the workplace."" Acting Deputy Administrator for the Labor Department's Wage and Hour Division Mary Beth Maxwell said, ""The significance of the FMLA is in its recognition that workers aren't just contributing to the success of a business, but away from their jobs they are contributing to the health and well-being of their families. Our survey results show that, for two decades, granting job-protected leave has been good for employers and good for millions of workers and their loved ones. The FMLA is working."" The study shows that employers generally find it easy to comply with the law, and misuse of the FMLA by workers is rare. The vast majority of employers, 91 percent, report that complying with the FMLA has either no noticeable effect or a positive effect on business operations such as employee absenteeism, turnover and morale. Finally, 90 percent of workers return to their employer after FMLA leave, showing little risk to businesses that investment in a worker will be lost as a result of leave granted under the act. The FMLA was signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 1993. It allows workers to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to bond with a newborn, newly adopted or newly placed child; care for a seriously ill child, spouse or parent; or care for their own serious health condition without fear of losing their jobs. Amendments to the act have extended the protections to allow workers with family in the military to take time away from work to attend to situations arising from a parent, spouse, son or daughter's foreign deployment and up to 26 weeks of leave to care for a service member with a serious injury or illness. The Wage and Hour Division continues to advance the knowledge of the employer and employee communities in the administration and usage of the FMLA. As education continues, the positive impacts of the FMLA will continue to benefit the workplace nationwide.

A U.S. District Court judge ordered the payments after an investigation by the U.S. Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division disclosed that the employer willfully violated the minimum wage, overtime and record-keeping provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act. Bloom Energy brought the workers in from Mexico to refurbish power generators alongside U.S. workers. Investigators learned that the 14 workers were paid in Mexican pesos the equivalent of $2.66 per hour. Because of the willful nature of the violations found, the department also assessed $6,160 in civil money penalties against the employer. ""This investigation has remedied illegal pay practices for a group of workers subjected to substandard wages,"" said Ruben Rosalez, regional administrator for the Wage and Hour Division in the West. ""It is appalling that this was happening right in the heart of Silicon Valley, one of the wealthiest per capita areas in the U.S. The department remains vigilant in protecting the rights of vulnerable workers and to ensuring they are paid the wages they have rightfully earned. This case demonstrates our commitment to making that happen."" The FLSA prohibits employers from employing workers below the federal minimum wage and prohibits employers from shipping in commerce any goods produced in violation of its minimum wage, overtime, or child labor provisions. The Wage and Hour Division is required under the FLSA to investigate and bring actions in federal court to enjoin any acts which are unlawful due to employment in violation of these provisions Bloom Energy is a manufacturer of clean energy power generating systems and contracts with major brand-name companies, such as Google Inc., Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Kaiser Permanente, Coca-Cola Co., FedEx Corp., eBay Inc. and Bank of America Corp. The department requested that the employer not ship the goods produced in violation until the violations were resolved. The employer has paid the back wages, liquidated damages and penalties in full and has agreed to comply in the future with all FLSA requirements. The department also required that the employer to sign a consent judgment. The FLSA requires that covered, nonexempt employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour for all hours worked, as well as time and one-half their regular hourly rates of pay for every hour they work beyond 40 per week. The law also requires employers to maintain accurate records of employees' wages, hours and other conditions of employment, and prohibits employers from retaliating against employees who exercise their rights. The FLSA provides that employers who violate the law are, as a general rule, liable to employees for their back wages and an equal amount in liquidated damages. Liquidated damages are paid directly to the affected employees.

"February 4, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20130204,US Department of Labor achieves $5.2 million settlement for retirement plan clients of ING Life Insurance and Annuity Co.,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Labor today announced a settlement agreement with ING Life Insurance and Annuity Co. that provides for a $5.2 million payment to certain retirement plan clients adversely affected by its undisclosed practice of keeping investment gains achieved when the company failed to process requested transactions in a timely manner. The department alleged that ILIAC's failure to disclose its policy on reconciling transaction processing errors to retirement plan clients was a violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. ""This Labor Department settlement will restore funds to about 1,400 retirement plans and ultimately benefit hard-working Americans who are making sacrifices now in order to save for their retirement years,"" said acting Secretary Seth D. Harris. ""All of us who are planning for retirement deserve to know how our savings and investments are being handled, how much is being charged in fees and how much these transactions impact final account balances."" Assistant Secretary of Labor for Employee Benefits Security Phyllis C. Borzi said, ""This settlement is reflective of my agency's commitment to enforcing requirements for transparency in the retirement savings marketplace. Failure of a plan fiduciary to disclose the revenue it received from managing retirement plans is a disservice to employers who are providing this benefit to their workers."" The agreement announced today also requires ILIAC to disclose its policy on how it corrects transaction processing errors to plan clients covered by ERISA and to adopt procedures for terminating abandoned plans through the Employee Benefits Security Administration's Abandoned Plan Program. In addition, ILIAC has agreed to pay a $524,508.73 civil penalty. The $5.2 million that ILIAC has agreed to pay represents net gains kept by the company that resulted from the manner in which certain transaction processing errors were handled during the 2008-2011 period. The department alleged that this service provider's failure to disclose its transaction error correction policy to its ERISA plan clients resulted in it receiving compensation in violation of the act. It has been ILIAC's practice to keep gains derived from processing transactions that it failed to timely process as of the contract date as well as from re-processing erroneous transactions. In both instances, ILIAC makes corrections using the date required by its contract. Gains and losses result when the share or unit value differs between the contract date and the actual trade date. Any gains in share or unit value between the contract date and trade date are kept by ILIAC, whereas ILIAC is obligated, by contract, to make plans whole for any losses. The settlement agreement requires that ILIAC make full disclosure of its transactions policy to its current and prospective ERISA plan clients in writing. Current plan clients will be given the opportunity to object to the policy within 30 days of receipt of notice. Prospective plan clients will be informed of the policy by way of its incorporation in ILIAC's contracts and service agreements. The disclosure also will state that ILIAC will track the effect of the corrections for each affected plan on an annual basis and will make that information available to its ERISA plan clients. ILIAC will acknowledge in the disclosure that any gains it keeps as a result of the policy constitute additional compensation for the services the company provides and it will report such compensation in accordance with ERISA Section 408(b)(2). According to the settlement, ILIAC also will ensure that any plans deemed to have been abandoned will be properly terminated. It will attempt to contact the sponsor of each such plan, and if its efforts are unsuccessful, ILIAC agrees to become that plan's qualified termination administrator. ILIAC is an insurance company with approximately 35,000 ERISA-covered plan clients. It has offices in Connecticut and provides, among other things, custodial and third party administration services to defined contribution plans that are sponsored by business organizations.

"February 1, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20130201,Statement of acting Labor Secretary Seth D. Harris on January employment numbers,"WASHINGTON – Acting Secretary of Labor Seth D. Harris issued the following statement on the January 2013 Employment Situation report released today: ""This morning's report shows solid, steady growth in jobs. The economy added 157,000 nonfarm payroll jobs in January, while the unemployment rate was unchanged at7.9 percent. ""January's report marks 35 consecutive months of private sector job growth totaling more than 6.1 million jobs. Today's report shows that the economy gained 2.25 million private sector jobs in 2012, which includes an annual revision to the survey that resulted in an additional 424,000 jobs. ""Our recovery from the Great Recession continues at a steady pace as we build on previous gains in job creation. The recent strengthening of the housing market, in particular, is driving welcome growth in construction employment, with 98,000 jobs added over the past four months and 296,000 jobs over the past two years. Retail jobs, health care jobs, and professional and business services jobs also contributed to the positive numbers in today's report. ""Over the last three months, we've added an average of 208,000 private sector jobs, and that is a real testament to the resilience of our economy. But there is more work to do. The bipartisan American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 enacted this month met President Obama's goal of keeping taxes low for middle class families – a critical part of assuring that our economy will stay on its path toward greater growth. Congress should resolve remaining tax and spending issues to provide hard-working middle-class families and small businesses a measure of certainty about the future. As Congress considers how it should address long-term deficit challenges, it is essential that it take a balanced approach that preserves programs providing important safeguards for working families struggling to make ends meet in an improving labor market."""

"January 31, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20130131,MSHA releases preliminary fatality data for 2012,"Fatality rates at an all-time low, while annual number of deaths is 2nd lowest ARLINGTON, Va. – Preliminary data from the U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration released today indicates that, in 2012, mining fatality rates reached an all-time low for the second straight year. Fatality rates are calculated based on the number of mining deaths per 200,000 hours worked. ""Of all miners working in mines last year, fewer lost their lives in mining accidents, and more returned home safely to their family and friends at the end of their shifts,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. He added: ""While mining deaths and injuries – due to the efforts of all in the mining industry – have reached historic lows, more actions are needed to prevent mining injuries, illnesses and deaths."" Thirty-six miners (19 in coal and 17 in metal/nonmetal mining) died in work-related accidents at the nation's mines in 2012, making it the second-lowest annual fatality total on record, one more fatality than the 2009 historic low of 35. Seven miners died in West Virginia, five in Kentucky, three each in New York and Alabama, two each in Montana and Florida, and one each in Arizona, California, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Virginia. The leading cause of fatalities during 2012 was powered haulage, which claimed the lives of 10 miners. Other causes included machinery accidents, which killed six; slip or fall of person accidents, which also claimed six lives; and rib falls, which killed three miners. Most notable was the number of supervisor deaths, which accounted for nine fatalities, or 25 percent of the total – a much higher percentage than in previous years and cause for concern. In 2012, three of the miners killed at metal/nonmetal mines had less than one year of experience at the mine. Five miners had less than one year of experience at the job or task they were performing. At coal mines, five miners who died had one year or less experience at the mine. Eight miners who were killed had one year or less experience at the job or task they were performing when they died. ""These numbers underscore that effective and appropriate training – particularly task training – needs to be provided to miners before they perform a new task,"" said Main. Pinning, crushing and striking accidents in underground coal mines continue to cause significant numbers of injuries and fatalities. From 1984 through 2012, 73 deaths occurred from these types of accidents – including 33 that were associated with continuous mining machines and could have been prevented by proximity detection, a system designed to stop mining machinery from coming into contact with miners. MSHA estimates that using a proximity detection system could have prevented several nonfatal injuries associated with underground mining machines. MSHA believes that, in 2012, three deaths at coal mines could have been prevented if these systems had been in place. Some mine operators already have invested in this technology.

"January 31, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/owcp/owcp20130131,US Department of Labor reaches settlement with contractor on failure to report injuries and fatalities under Defense Base Act,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Labor's Office of Workers' Compensation Programs today announced a $75,000 settlement with The Sandi Group/Corporate Bank Financial Services for failure to report in a timely manner on the injuries and deaths of 30 employees in Iraq between 2003 and 2005. Under the Defense Base Act, a company must report any injury or death to OWCP's Division of Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation within 10 days, and any knowing and willful failure to report subjects the employer to a civil penalty. In the settlement, The Sandi Group agreed not only to pay the $75,000 fine but that future violations would result in greater penalties. ""Timely reporting of work-related injuries, illnesses and fatalities are vitally important to protect the interests of injured workers and their families,"" said Gary A. Steinberg, acting director of OWCP. ""In the case of injuries and illnesses, this enables timely medical treatment, payment of compensation benefits and, when possible, return to work, and for fatalities, timely issuance of death benefits for eligible survivors. The Labor Department is committed to administering the provisions of the Defense Base Act, which provide necessary medical care and compensation benefits that hold workers and families together during moments of hardship."" The Sandi Group, a Washington, D.C.-based company, employed workers that provided security and other services in support of U.S. operations in Iraq. The Defense Base Act provides workers' compensation protection to civilian employees working outside the United States on U.S. military bases or under a contract with the U.S. government for public work or for national defense. For more information, visit http://www.dol.gov/owcp/dlhwc/lsdba.htm . The mission of OWCP's Division of Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation is to minimize the impact of employment-related injuries, illnesses and deaths on employees and their families by ensuring that workers' compensation benefits are provided promptly and properly under the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, the Defense Base Act, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act and the Non-appropriated Fund Instrumentalities Act.

Keith Vinson and Tradition, LLC, involving failure to remit employee contributions to the company’s health plan in Hendersonville, NC","Date of Action: January 25, 2013 Type of Action: Complaint Name(s) of Defendant(s): Keith Vinson and Tradition, LLC Allegations: In 2007, Tradition, LLC, based in Asheville, N.C., established a health plan for its employees through Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina. During the course of an investigation by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Employee Benefits Security Administration, the agency found that Blue Cross Blue Shield terminated the contract with Tradition in September 2009 due to nonpayment of premiums.

"January 29, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20130129,US Labor Departments MSHA continues increased emphasis on miner discrimination complaints,"46 requests for temporary reinstatement made in 2012 WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration filed 46 requests for temporary reinstatement during the 2012 calendar year, more than double any previous year, with the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission on behalf of miners who submitted complaints of discrimination in the form of a suspension, layoff, discharge or other adverse action. Additionally, the department filed 34 complaints alleging mine safety discrimination during 2012, also more than in any previous year. The department filed 101 temporary reinstatement requests in calendar years 2009 - 2012, or an average of 25 per year, compared to an average of six per year 1993 - 2008. Additionally, the department filed a total of 105 discrimination complaints with the commission 2009 - 2012, compared to 63 during the prior four-year period. According to Section 105(c) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, a miner cannot be discharged, discriminated against or interfered with in the exercise of statutory rights because he or she has engaged in a protected activity such as filing a complaint alleging a health or safety violation, or refusing to work under unsafe or unhealthy conditions. ""MSHA urges miners to exercise their rights, and actively participate in monitoring safety and health conditions,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""We take these rights under the Mine Act very seriously and will vigorously investigate all discrimination complaints."" Under the Mine Act, if MSHA finds that a miner's complaint is ""not frivolously brought,"" the agency, on behalf of the miner, will ask the commission to order immediate reinstatement for the miner while the case is pending. Issues related to discrimination and retaliation of miners came to light at congressional hearings related to the Upper Big Branch Mine disaster, where there was testimony that some miners were reluctant to complain about safety conditions due to fear of reprisals from management. MSHA obtained similar evidence in its investigation into the causes of the mine explosion."

The 401(k) plan was established in May 2001. The plan’s administrator, trustee and sole fiduciary, Michael O’Reilly, passed away in November 2008, and Windswept Environmental ceased operations in February 2009. As a result, former employees of the company have been unable to access their 401(k) accounts. Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, plans must be managed by fiduciaries. In the absence of a plan fiduciary, participants and beneficiaries cannot obtain plan information, make investments or collect retirement benefits. In this case, the plan has 12 participants and more than $129,000 in assets. The department’s lawsuit asks the court to appoint an independent fiduciary to administer the plan and distribute the assets to its participants and beneficiaries. “The department has taken this legal action so the plan’s participants can access the funds that rightly belong to them,” said Jonathan Kay, regional director for the department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration in New York. “Workers should know that they can turn to the department for assistance when they find themselves locked out of access to their retirement plan. We are here to help them.” This suit resulted from an investigation conducted by EBSA’s New York Regional Office. The case is being litigated by the department’s regional solicitor in New York. Workers participating in employer-sponsored health and retirement benefit plans who feel that they have been denied a benefit inappropriately or have questions about benefits laws can contact an EBSA benefits adviser by visiting www.askebsa.dol.gov or calling 866-444-EBSA (3272).

"January 28, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20130128-1,US Labor Department Updates Delinquent Filer Voluntary Compliance Program,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor’s Employee Benefits Security Administration today announced technical updates to its Delinquent Filer Voluntary Compliance Program. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act requires most private-sector plans to file an annual return/report of employee benefit plan. This is usually the Form 5500 or, for certain small plans, Form 5500-SF. Plan administrators who fail or refuse to comply with ERISA’s annual filing requirement may incur significant monetary penalties. The Delinquent Filer Voluntary Compliance Program was established in April 1995 to encourage plan administrators to file overdue, incomplete or incorrect Form 5500 annual reports with reduced civil penalties.

"January 24, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20130124,MSHA announces results of December 2012 impact inspections,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration today announced that federal inspectors issued 150 citations and nine orders during special impact inspections conducted at eight coal mines and three metal/nonmetal mines last month. The monthly inspections, which began in force in April 2010 following the explosion at the Upper Big Branch Mine, involve mines that merit increased agency attention and enforcement due to their poor compliance history or particular compliance concerns. These matters include high numbers of violations or closure orders; frequent hazard complaints or hotline calls; plan compliance issues; inadequate workplace examinations; a high number of accidents, injuries or illnesses; fatalities; adverse conditions such as increased methane liberation, faulty roof conditions and inadequate ventilation; and respirable dust. As an example from last month, one impact inspection was conducted on Dec. 11 during the day shift at Dorchester Enterprises Inc., Mine No. 4 in Wise County, Va. Upon arrival at the mine, MSHA personnel secured the mine's communication system to prevent advance notice of the inspection. The inspection team travelled underground to two mechanized mining units, and an additional team member inspected the surface. MSHA cited violations concerning ventilation practices and conditions, as well as accumulation of combustible material. A total of 13 citations and five orders were issued, nine cited on the surface and nine underground. Two unwarrantable failure orders were issued for the mine operator failing to follow the approved ventilation plan on the active mechanized mining units. The inspection team observed visible dust overriding the machine scrubber system and rolling across the top of the continuous mining machine and shuttle car operator. Air readings taken by inspectors indicated increased potential for ignitions in the mine as well as for injuries and illnesses to miners. The mine operator has been cited 35 times in the past two years for failure to follow the approved ventilation plan. This impact inspection was the second at Mine No. 4; 10 citations were issued during the previous impact inspection in February 2011. ""December's impact inspections found one of the lowest numbers of violations to date, which tells us broadly that mines undergoing impact inspections are improving,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""But we still see some mines that fail to address recurring problems that put miners at risk."" As another example from last month, MSHA conducted an impact inspection Dec. 4-9 at Asarco LLC, Ray Mine, a large surface copper ore mine located in Gila County, Ariz. The mine, which employs 783 miners, was issued 28 citations. Conditions cited included not providing insulating material to prevent electrical shock to miners and equipment safety defects that exposed miners to hazards and were not repaired in a timely manner. Ray Mine has been cited 26 times in the past two years for violating this equipment safety standard. Two citations were issued for openings in railings that exposed miners to fall hazards of approximately 100 feet in one area, and a separate area that exposed miners to fall hazards of more than 8 feet into a sulfide solution pond. Another citation was issued for fall hazards of more than 20 feet that were not immediately apparent to miners and not properly identified with barricades and/or warning signs. Two citations were issued for not providing automatic backup alarms on a welding truck and a skid loader to warn miners in the area of the vehicles' movement. This impact inspection was the second at the mine; 46 citations were issued during the previous impact inspection in April 2011. Since April 2010, MSHA has conducted 550 impact inspections and issued 9,595 citations, 909 orders and 40 safeguards. Editor's notes: On Jan. 1, the operator and mine name of Dorchester Enterprises Inc., Mine No. 4 changed to Mill Branch Coal Corp., Dorchester Mine.

"January 17, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20130117,US Department of Labor announces availability of $75 million through YouthBuild grants program to help young people develop job skills,"WASHINGTON – Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis today announced the availability of approximately $75 million in YouthBuild grant funds to develop programs that will help out-of-school youths complete high school or General Educational Development programs, as well as learn critical occupational skills in construction, health care, information technology and other fields. ""The YouthBuild programs open doors for thousands of at-risk youths in at least two ways. They are provided with an opportunity to develop job skills for successful careers, and they learn the importance of leadership and making contributions to strengthen communities,"" Secretary Solis said. The U.S. Department of Labor anticipates serving more than 5,200 young people through 75 grants, ranging from $700,000 to $1.1 million each, to be awarded to organizations that oversee education and employment services for disadvantaged youths in their communities. YouthBuild is a nonresidential, community-based alternative education program that provides classroom instructionand occupational skills training to 16- to 24-year-olds at risk of falling out of the labor force. Enrollees have been in the juvenile justice system, are aging out of foster care, dropped out of high school or are at risk of failing to reach key educational milestones. Participants in YouthBuild programs learn valuable skillsas they build or rehabilitate housing for low-income or homeless individuals and families in their communities. Regulations issued in February 2012 expanded YouthBuild skills training beyond construction to include training in high-demand occupations, such as health care and information technology. Non-construction skills training programs also must include leadership development and community service elements to ensure that youths maintain a connection to their communities through volunteerism. The solicitation for grant applications, which includes information about how to apply for a grant, will be published in the Jan. 22 edition of the Federal Register. It is available to view now at http://www.grants.gov . For more information on YouthBuild and other youth employment programs, visit http://www.doleta.gov/youth_services ."
"January 17, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20130117,MSHA to publish pattern of violations final rule,"WASHINGTON – Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis today announced a final rule to strengthen safety in the nation's most dangerous mines. The rule, which revises the Mine Safety and Health Administration's pattern of violations regulation in 30 Code of Federal Regulations Part 104, has been submitted to the Federal Register for publication. It will ensure that mine operators monitor and address the most hazardous safety problems in their mines. It also strengthens MSHA's hand to respond to dangerous mining conditions, and improve safety and health for mining's most important resource – the miner. ""The tragedy at the Upper Big Branch Mine should not be forgotten. It exacted a terrible toll on the nation, coal miners' families and coal companies. Over the last three years, the Labor Department has undergone a serious and comprehensive evaluation of mine safety practices, and that has led to reforms to protect America's miners. The rule we are announcing today will hold mine operators accountable when they disregard life-saving safety measures,"" Secretary Solis said. ""This final rule represents one of MSHA's highest priority regulatory initiatives and one that addresses Congress' intent that this regulation encourage chronic violators to comply with the Mine Act and MSHA's health and safety standards,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""We think that this final rule will help prevent another tragedy such as occurred at the Upper Big Branch Mine. It promotes consistency in applying the POV notice as an enforcement tool, provides for a more open and transparent process, emphasizes operators' responsibility to comply with safety and health standards and monitor their own compliance, and more effectively achieves the statutory intent of the Mine Act."" Under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, MSHA is required to issue a POV notice to any mine operator that demonstrates a disregard for the health and safety of miners through a pattern of significant and substantial violations. An S&S violation is one that contributes to a safety or health hazard that is reasonably likely to result in a reasonably serious injury or illness. The POV final rule, which is also responsive to several recommendations made by the Labor Department's Office of the Inspector General in a September 2010 report, strengthens MSHA's ability to deal with the nation's most dangerous, troubling mines and mine operators. It places the agency in a better position to identify operators that demonstrate a disregard for the health and safety of miners and have not responded to other enforcement measures. ""There has been recognition by many that the system has been broken, with no mine being placed on POV status until 2011 – 33 years after the law went into effect,"" said Main. ""MSHA should not be prevented from taking action to protect the lives of miners for months, or even years, while we await the final outcome of citations and orders that a mine operator can easily contest. The new rule addresses those flaws."" The following are among the final rule's major provisions: Allows MSHA to issue a POV notice without first issuing a potential POV notice. Eliminates the existing requirement that MSHA can consider only final orders in its POV review. Establishes general criteria and procedures that MSHA will use to identify mines with a pattern of S&S violations. Reinforces mine operators' responsibility for compliance with MSHA safety and health standards and for monitoring their mines' compliance. Clarifies that MSHA will consider a mine operator's effective implementation of an MSHA-approved corrective action program as a mitigating circumstance in its POV review, if the program contains definitive benchmarks implemented prior to POV notice, and the operator has reduced S&S violations. Restates the statutory requirement that, for mines in POV status, each S&S violation will result in a withdrawal order until a complete inspection finds no S&S violations. ""The primary purpose of the POV rule is the restoration of safe and healthful conditions at noncompliant mines,"" said Main. ""The final rule better achieves the goal of the Mine Act and the intent of Congress."" In April 2011, MSHA launched an online monitoring tool that enables mine operators, miners and the public to determine, based on the most recent data available, how a specific mine matches up with the criteria for a potential pattern of violations. Under the final rule, the online tool will continue to be available to measure compliance performance against POV criteria. The POV rule is the third regulation MSHA has issued aimed at preventing coal mine dust explosions, such as the one that occurred at the Upper Big Branch Mine. MSHA issued a final rule to improve rock dust standards on June 21, 2011, and a final rule on underground coal mine examinations April 6, 2012. Both of these rules were aimed at improving conditions that could lead to such explosions. The rule announced today can be viewed at http://www.msha.gov ."
"January 17, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ofccp/ofccp20130117,Labor Department sues US Security Associates for refusing to comply with federal investigation of employment practices,"Complaint asks court to bar security company from government contracting CHICAGO  The U.S. Department of Labor has filed lawsuits to require Roswell, Ga.-based U.S. Security Associates Inc. — which provides uniformed and trained guards and other emergency responders under federal contract — to submit documents detailing the company's affirmative action plans for its own facilities in Milwaukee, Wis., and Portage, Ind. The Labor Department's suits, filed with its Office of Administrative Law Judges, calls for the company to provide the department's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs with all documents and information requested, cooperate with scheduled compliance reviews and fully comply with the requirements of all laws enforced by the agency. If the company fails to comply, the department asks the court to cancel all of USA's current government contracts and to debar the entire company from entering into future contracts. ""Providing OFCCP investigators with access to the documents they need in order to do their jobs is not optional,"" said OFCCP Director Patricia A. Shiu. ""U.S. Security Associates is well aware of its contractual obligation to submit the records we seek, and the company's denial of access at these two facilities is especially perplexing given its cooperation in providing the same documentation in past compliance reviews."" OFCCP sent a scheduling letter to the company's Milwaukee facility on Dec. 7, 2011, and its Portage facility on Dec. 13, 2011, requesting records that are required for a compliance review. Instead of submitting its affirmative action plans, as required by law, USA filed a complaint with the Office of Administrative Law Judges on June 21, 2012, seeking declaratory relief from the scheduled reviews. On Sep. 17, 2012, Chief Administrative Law Judge Stephen Purcell dismissed the company's complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. USA appealed the decision to the Administrative Review Board, and the matter is currently pending. Over the following months, OFCCP continued to request that the company submit its plans but, to date, the contractor has refused. The named facilities are two of more than 20 USA sites that currently have open OFCCP compliance evaluations. Efforts to resolve the issue between the two parties failed when USA decided to deny OFCCP access to information about its affirmative action programs in Milwaukee and Portage. The issue of providing OFCCP with access to such information has been affirmed by the courts numerous times. In November 2011, Chief Judge Royce C. Lamberth of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled, in a similar case, that ""Submission to such lawful investigations is the price of working as a federal contractor."" Since at least 2008, USA has been a party to federal contracts that obligate it to develop and maintain plans for its affirmative action programs and provide those plans to OFCCP upon request. In July 2009, USA was awarded a contract with the General Services Administration worth more than $1 million. The company also was awarded a federal contract with the U.S. State Department for more than $7 million covering a period from September 2010 through October 2015. OFCCP enforces Executive Order 11246, Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974. These three laws require those who do business with the federal government, both contractors and subcontractors, to follow the fair and reasonable standard that they not discriminate in employment on the basis of sex, race, color, religion, national origin, disability or status as a protected veteran.

"January 17, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20130117,"US Labor Department, Iowa Workforce Development sign agreement to reduce misclassification of employees as independent contractors","WASHINGTON — Officials of the U.S. Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division and Iowa Workforce Development today signed a memorandum of understanding to protect the rights of employees by preventing their misclassification as independent contractors by employers. Mary Beth Maxwell, acting deputy administrator of the Wage and Hour Division, and Teresa Wahlert, director of Iowa Workforce Development, also hosted a press teleconference to discuss how their two agencies will embark on new efforts, guided by this memorandum, to protect the rights of employees and level the playing field for responsible employers by reducing the practice of misclassification by some businesses. Iowa is the 14th state to form this type of partnership with the Labor Department. ""This memorandum of understanding sends a clear message: We're standing united to end the practice of misclassifying employees,"" said Maxwell ""This is an important step toward making sure that the American dream is still available for employees and responsible employers alike."" ""Misclassification is an issue that affects all states. This memorandum will allow Iowa to utilize federal resources that weren't available to the state previously,"" said Wahlert. Since September 2011, when the Wage and Hour Division began entering into memorandums of understanding with states and announced a similar partnership with the Internal Revenue Service, the division has collected $9.5 million in back wages for more than 11,400 workers where the primary reason for minimum wage or overtime violations under the Fair Labor Standards Act was that workers were not treated or classified as employees. These figures represent an 80 percent increase in back wages and a 50 percent increase in the number of workers receiving back wages following the implementation of these agreements. Business models that attempt to change or obscure the employment relationship through the use of independent contractors are not inherently illegal, but they may not be used to evade compliance with federal labor law. Although legitimate independent contractors are an important part of our economy, the misclassification of employees presents a serious problem, as these employees often are denied access to critical benefits and protections — such as family and medical leave, overtime compensation, minimum wage pay and Unemployment Insurance — to which they are entitled. In addition, misclassification can create economic pressure for law-abiding business owners, who often find it difficult to compete with those who are skirting the law.Employee misclassification also generates substantial losses for state Unemployment Insurance and workers' compensation funds. Memorandums of understanding with state government agencies arose as part of the department's Misclassification Initiative, which was launched under the auspices of Vice President Biden's Middle Class Task Force with the goal of preventing, detecting and remedying employee misclassification. California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Utah and Washington have signed similar agreements. More information is available on the Department of Labor's misclassification Web page at http://www.dol.gov/misclassification/ . The mission of the department is to foster, promote and develop the welfare of the wage earners, job seekers and retirees of the United States; improve working conditions; advance opportunities for profitable employment; and ensure work-related benefits and rights.

""Since his earliest days in West Virginia as a volunteer, Sen. Rockefeller has led an unrelenting fight for our nation's coal miners.

"January 16, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20130116,"Savannah, Ga., lawyer and firm ordered to restore losses and interest to employee retirement plans following US Labor Department investigation","SAVANNAH, Ga. – A judge has ordered former Savannah attorney Benjamin S. Eichholz and the Eichholz Law Firm P.C. to restore losses and interest to the firm’s retirement and pension plans. The order resolves a lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Labor, which was based on an investigation by the department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration. EBSA found that Eichholz and his former law firm breached their fiduciary responsibilities in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and caused losses to the plans in excess of $1 million. Under the terms of the order, Eichholz and his mother, Harriet B. Eichholz, forfeited their right to any cash benefits from the plans. Eichholz and the firm will restore $15,053 to the plans and transfer $32,206 in plan assets to an independent fiduciary. In December 2009, Eichholz pleaded guilty to obstructing EBSA’s investigation. He was sentenced to 21 months in prison and ordered to pay restitution of $50,117 to the plans. “Workers deserve to reap the full benefits of their hard-earned retirement savings,” said Isabel Colon, EBSA’s regional director in Atlanta. “This agency is committed to taking action on behalf of workers when plan fiduciaries fail in their duty to act solely in the interest of the participants.” The department filed the lawsuit in 2010 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia-Savannah Division, alleging that the defendants violated ERISA by improperly transferring and lending plan assets to prohibited individuals or organizations, such as the firm, Eichholz, his former wife, and companies he owned or controlled. In addition to paying restitution, the judgment permanently bars Eichholz and the firm from acting as fiduciaries of any plan subject to ERISA, it appointed an independent fiduciary to administer the plans, and it requires the defendants to reimburse the plan for those fees and expenses. The independent fiduciary is now responsible for the plans’ assets and distributing them to eligible participants and beneficiaries. Eichholz and the firm are also required to pay a civil penalty equal to 20 percent of the applicable recovery amount. The case was investigated by the EBSA’s Atlanta District Office. It was litigated by the department’s Regional Office of the Solicitor in Atlanta. Workers participating in employer-sponsored health and retirement benefit plans who feel that they have been denied a benefit inappropriately or have questions about benefits laws can contact an EBSA benefits adviser by visiting www.askebsa.dol.gov or calling 866-444-EBSA (3272).

"January 15, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20130115,BNSF Railway Co. signs accord with US Labor Departments OSHA regarding employee practices under Federal Railroad Safety Act,"WASHINGTON The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration has signed an accord with BNSF Railway Co., headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, announcing BNSF's voluntary revision of several personnel policies that OSHA alleged violated the whistleblower provisions of the Federal Railroad Safety Act and dissuaded workers from reporting on-the-job injuries. FRSA's Section 20109 protects railroad workers from retaliation for, among other acts, reporting suspected violations of federal laws and regulations related to railroad safety and security, hazardous safety or security conditions, and on-the-job injuries. ""Protecting America's railroad workers who report on-the-job injuries from retaliation is an essential element in OSHA's mission. This accord makes significant progress toward ensuring that BNSF employees who report injuries do not suffer any adverse consequences for doing so,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health Dr. David Michaels. ""It also sets the tone for other railroad employers throughout the U.S. to take steps to ensure that their workers are not harassed, intimidated or terminated, in whole or part, for reporting workplace injuries."" The major terms of the accord include: Changing BNSF's disciplinary policy so that injuries no longer play a role in determining the length of an employee's probation following a record suspension for a serious rule violation. As of Aug. 31, 2012, BNSF has reduced the probations of 136 employees who were serving longer probations because they had been injured on-the-job. Eliminating a policy that assigned points to employees who sustained on-the-job injuries. Revising a program that required increased safety counseling and prescribed operations testing so that work-related injuries will no longer be the basis for enrolling employees in the program. As part of the negotiations leading up to the accord, BNSF removed from the program approximately 400 workers. Instituting a higher level review by BNSF's upper management and legal department for cases in which an employee who reports an on-duty personal injury is also assessed discipline related to the incident giving rise to the injury. Implementing a training program for BNSF's managers and labor relations and human resources professionals to educate them about their responsibilities under the FRSA. The training will be incorporated into BNSF's annual supervisor certification program. Making settlement offers in 36 cases to employees who filed whistleblower complaints with OSHA alleging they were harmed by one or more of the company's previous policies. ""Ensuring that employees can report injuries or illnesses without fear of retaliation is crucial to protecting worker safety and health,"" said Michaels. ""If employees do not feel free to report injuries or illnesses, the employer's entire workforce is put at risk because employers do not learn of and correct dangerous conditions that have resulted in injuries."" Between August 2007, when OSHA was assigned responsibility for whistleblower complaints under FRSA, and September 2012, OSHA received 1,206 FRSA whistleblower complaints. The number of FRSA whistleblower complaints that OSHA currently receives surpasses the number of whistleblower complaints that OSHA receives under any of the other 21 whistleblower protection statutes it enforces except for Section 11(c) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. More than 60 percent of the FRSA complaints filed with OSHA involve an allegation that a railroad worker has been retaliated against for reporting an on-the-job injury. The accord with BNSF Railway Co. can be viewed at http://www.whistleblowers.gov/acts/bnsf_accord.html . The whistleblower provisions of the 22 statutes enforced by OSHA protect employees who report violations of various commercial motor vehicle, airline, nuclear, pipeline, environmental, railroad, public transportation, maritime, consumer product, health care reform, securities, food safety, and consumer financial reform laws and regulations. Employees who believe that they have been retaliated against for engaging in a protected activity may file a complaint with the secretary of labor for an investigation by OSHA's Whistleblower Protection Program.

"January 10, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20130110,"US Labor Departments OSHA cites Waco, Texas, battery manufacturer with 8 serious health violations","WACO, Texas The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration has cited Marathon Norco Aerospace Inc. with eight serious health violations following a July inspection for exposing workers to hazardous materials, such as nickel and cadmium, at the company's facility on Imperial Drive in Waco. Proposed penalties total $41,220. OSHA's Fort Worth Area Office cited the employer for failing to ensure that cadmium contaminated trash cans containing used personal protective equipment and other contaminated, discarded items were properly labeled; provide effective hazard communication training regarding the dangers of exposure to nickel nitrate and sulfuric acid compounds to new employees; provide proper respiratory protection, such as self-contained breathing apparatus; provide required machine guarding; and repair electrical wiring deficiencies. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known. ""This company exposed its workers to health hazards associated with cadmium dust, which can result in serious respiratory illnesses,"" said Jack Rector, OSHA's area director in Fort Worth. ""It is the employer's responsibility to provide a safe and healthful working environment for employees."" Marathon Norco Aerospace, which manufactures and assembles aircraft batteries, employs approximately 150 workers. The company has 15 business days from receipt of the citations to comply, request an informal conference with OSHA's area director or contest the citations and penalties before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. To ask questions, obtain compliance assistance, file a complaint, or report workplace hospitalizations, fatalities or situations posing imminent danger to workers, the public should call OSHA's toll-free hotline at 800-321-OSHA (6742) or the agency's Fort Worth Area Office at 817-581-7303.

""This company benefited by not paying employees all the wages they were entitled to receive,"" said Cynthia Watson, regional administrator for the Wage and Hour Division in the Southwest. ""Car wash employees are among the most vulnerable employees in the workforce. The Labor Department remains committed to protecting the rights and wages of these workers and to leveling the playing field for employers who play by the rules. The back wages paid in this case should serve as a warning to other employers to ensure that they are paying their employees in compliance with the laws."" An investigation by the Wage and Hour Division's Dallas District Office found that the company's timekeeping system always rounded time worked in the employer's favor, resulting in paying employees for fewer hours than they had actually worked. Such shortages created minimum wage violations when employees' pay fell below the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. The employer also failed to pay employees overtime at time and one-half their regular rates of pay for hours worked beyond 40 in a workweek. Paradise Detail, which provides car wash and detailing services to car dealerships, agreed to comply with the FLSA in the future and to pay in full the back wages due. The FLSA requires that covered, nonexempt employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour for all hours worked, plus time and one-half their regular rates, including commissions, bonuses and incentive pay, for hours worked beyond 40 per week. In general, hours worked includes all time an employee must be on duty, or on the employer's premises or at any other prescribed place of work, from the beginning of the first principal work activity to the end of the last principal activity of the workday. Additionally, the law requires that accurate records of employees' wages, hours and other conditions of employment be maintained.

"January 9, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20130109,Statement by US Department of Labor on resignation of Secretary Hilda L. Solis,"WASHINGTON – Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis this afternoon sent the following letter to employees at the U.S. Department of Labor: ""Over the Christmas and New Year holidays with my family in California, I enjoyed my first opportunity in years to reflect on the past and my future, with an open mind and an open heart. After much discussion with family and close friends, I have decided to begin a new future, and return to the people and places I love and that have inspired and shaped my life. ""This afternoon, I submitted my resignation to President Obama. Growing up in a large Mexican-American family in La Puente, California, I never imagined that I would have the opportunity to serve in a president's Cabinet, let alone in the service of such an incredible leader. ""Because President Obama took very bold action, millions of Americans are back to work. There is still much to do, but we are well on the road to recovery, and middle class Americans know the president is on their side. ""Together we have achieved extraordinary things and I am so proud of our work on behalf of the nation's working families. It has been more than an honor to work alongside you in fulfilling the department's mission. Working with all of you as the nation's 25th secretary of labor, I have come to learn that the work we do every day is indeed a labor of love. ""I am humbled by the commitment of every single employee of this department – from the folks here in Washington to those who directly touch communities out in the field. Each of you brings passion to your work, and collectively, that makes a significant difference in the lives of our nation's working families. ""We have much to be proud of. In the past four years, more than 1.7 million people have completed federally-funded job training programs; of those, more than one million have earned industry-recognized credentials. In addition, Labor Department investments in our community colleges have expanded their capacity to provide local, flexible, employer-specific job training to millions of Americans, and transformed these institutions into engines of economic growth. ""Under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, we were the steward of more than $67 billion for unemployment insurance benefits, job training and placement, and worker protection. With ingenuity and integrity we ensured that these monies were carefully targeted to maximize job creation so that working people received the help they needed and deserved. ""We also played an important and active role in crafting regulatory actions to implement key aspects of the Affordable Care Act. Our work will help make President Obama's vision of a health care system that works for America a reality for millions of people. ""We have helped businesses big and small see the value of hiring returning military service members, and have fostered innovative efforts to help women and homeless veterans. ""And I am particularly proud to say that, as a result of our enforcement efforts, we have saved workers' lives. ""Calendar year 2011 saw the fewest-ever mine fatalities. Fatalities in general industry and construction are at historic lows. ""Because of our work, more people are receiving the wages they are owed. Last year we conducted the largest number of investigations in recent memory, collecting the most back wages in our history (more than $280 million on behalf of more than 300,000 workers denied their rightful pay, overtime or leave benefits). In these recoveries, what may seem to some as ""small change makes a huge difference for those who live paycheck-to-paycheck. In addition, our enforcement and informal resolution programs resulted in the recovery of almost $5 billion dollars for retirees and their families. ""Leaving the department is one of the most difficult decisions I have ever made, because I have taken our mission to heart. As the daughter of parents who worked in factories, paid their union dues and achieved their goal of a middle class life, and as the first Latina to head a major federal agency, it has been an incredible honor to serve. ""It has been my privilege to call you colleagues and friends. Thank you for all you have done and will continue to do to make life more just and safer for workers across this country. ""I am counting on you to keep up the good work. God bless you. And I will miss all of you. ""Sincerely, ""Hilda L. Solis ""U.S. Secretary of Labor"""
"January 9, 2013",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/odep/odep20130109,ODEP launches media campaign encouraging youth with disabilities to pursue career goals,"WASHINGTON — To help millions of people recognize what they can do to make a difference in the lives — and future careers — of young people with disabilities, the U.S. Department of Labor's Campaign for Disability Employment has released a new video public service announcement titled ""Because."" The PSA features real people with disabilities — not actors — who are pursuing and realizing their goals and passions as a result of the support they received from everyday people in their lives. Because nearly 1 out of 5 Americans has a disability, the PSA is intended to replace myths and misperceptions about disability employment with new views of what people with disabilities can do. ""Many people who achieve success and have found satisfaction in their careers have done so because one person believed in them and urged them to set their expectations high,"" said Kathy Martinez, assistant secretary of labor for disability employment policy. ""This PSA challenges viewers to rethink their ideas about what people with disabilities can achieve and consider what they might do to encourage young people with disabilities to pursue their personal and career goals."" The PSA is being distributed to more than 1,400 television, including cable, English- and Spanish-language stations. ""Because"" is the latest product of the Campaign for Disability Employment — a unique collaboration of leading business and disability organizations with the Department of Labor's Office of Disability Employment Policy that promotes the hiring, retention and advancement of people with disabilities. Campaign members include the American Association of People with Disabilities, the Job Accommodation Network, the National Business and Disability Council, the National Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce, the Society for Human Resource Management, Special Olympics and the U.S. Business Leadership Network.

Alatorre, manager and part-owner of the Akron establishment, have agreed to pay $45,781 in back wages and liquidated damages to 18 employees following an investigation by the U.S. Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division. The investigation found violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act's minimum wage, overtime pay and record-keeping provisions. The department filed a consent order and judgment in U.S. District Court, Northern District of Ohio, Eastern Division, stipulating the terms of the settlement. The investigation determined that Azteca Restaurante Mexicano paid some non-exempt workers — including bussers, cooks and dishwashers — flat weekly salaries instead of hourly wages. Violations occurred when these salaries, paid without regard to the numbers of hours employees worked, did not equal at least the federal minimum wage for all hours worked and did not include overtime pay for hours worked beyond 40 in a week. These employees were found to regularly work 60 or more hours per week. Servers employed by the company were also not paid time and one-half their regular rates for hours worked over 40 in a week, as required by the FLSA. The company also failed to maintain accurate pay and time records. ""Some of these employees were paid as little as $350 a week for 60 hours of labor,"" said George Victory, director of the Wage and Hour Division's Columbus Area Office. ""We are committed to protecting the many vulnerable workers employed in the restaurant industry and will vigorously pursue violators to ensure compliance with the law. This case should send a clear message to other employers that they should take steps to ensure that they are paying their employees properly."" Based on a previous investigation of the full-service restaurant and bar by the Wage and Hour Division, the company was assessed $9,450 in civil money penalties. Liquidated damages were also assessed, in addition to the back wages found due. The consent judgment entered in federal court in Akron enjoins Azteca Restaurante Mexicano and Alatorre from violating the FLSA in the future. The FLSA requires that covered, nonexempt employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 for all hours worked, plus time and one-half their regular rates of pay for hours worked beyond 40 per week. In accordance with the FLSA, an employer of a tipped employee is required to pay no less than $2.13 an hour in direct wages provided that amount plus the tips received equals at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. If an employee's tips combined with the employer's direct wages do not equal the minimum wage, the employer must make up the difference. Employers also are required to provide employees notice of the FLSA tip credit provisions, to maintain accurate time and payroll records and to comply with the hours, hazardous orders and other restrictions applying to workers under age 18. The FLSA provides that employers who violate the law are, as a general rule, liable to employees for their back wages and an equal amount in liquidated damages. Liquidated damages are paid directly to the affected employees.

For nearly three years, steady gains have occurred across different sectors of the economy, and December finishes a strong year of consistent growth with average increases of about 160,000 private sector jobs per month in 2012. ""The economy continued to show signs of strength and resilience throughout a month of fiscal uncertainty. This week's bipartisan agreement extending tax cuts to protect 98 percent of families and 97 percent of small businesses from any income tax increase is an important step in the right direction, as is the extension of crucial Unemployment Insurance benefits that serve as a necessary lifeline for millions of Americans still struggling to find employment, as well as generate $2 in economic activity for each dollar spent. ""There is more work to do to ensure that the steady growth experienced in 2012 continues into the new year. Now is not the time to slow this recovery by failing to address our fiscal challenges and introducing further uncertainty into the economy. As we move forward to address our ongoing fiscal challenges, both spending cuts and continuing to ask the wealthy to do a little more will be part of a balanced approach.We must continue to grow our economy, create jobs and strengthen our middle class by making investments in training, education and infrastructure."""

""Government contracts specify in detailed language how pay and benefits are to be determined, and employers are required to follow these rules so workers are fully paid,"" said Janet Campbell, district director of the Wage and Hour Division's office in Atlanta. ""Contractors are well aware of these obligations when they bid and when the contracts are awarded. This investigation demonstrates the Labor Department's commitment to ensuring that employees are paid the wages they have rightfully earned and to leveling the playing field among all employers who do business with the government."" The division's investigation determined that the employer incorrectly computed employees' vacation benefits as required by the SCA. The law requires that employers use employees' anniversary dates to determine the amounts of vacation benefits due. L-3 Communications Vertex had instead used the date of the company's first day of performance on the contract at the Army airfield to calculate vacation benefits for all employees. The SCA requires that calculation be made using the employee's anniversary date even when the employee worked for a predecessor contractor on the same contract. The employer has agreed to comply fully with the SCA in the future and to pay the back wages found due in full. L-3 Communications Vertex Aerospace is an aviation and aerospace technical services company, managing and servicing fixed-and rotary-wing aircraft, as well as other equipment, primarily for government customers. The company is based in Madison, Miss. The SCA requires that contractors and subcontractors performing services on covered federal contracts in excess of $2,500 must pay their service workers no less than the wages and fringe benefits prevailing in the locality or rates contained in a predecessor contractor's collective bargaining agreement.

Defendants Asian Moon Restaurant of Massapequa Park Inc., Asian Moon Restaurant Corp. in Garden City, Golden Rod Restaurant Corp. in New Rochelle and Vickie Sue Li also will pay $98,231 in civil money penalties and interest for violations of the federal Fair Labor Standard Act's minimum wage, overtime and record-keeping provisions. The judgments resolve lawsuits filed by the department that were based on investigations by its Wage and Hour Division. Investigators from the division's Long Island and White Plains offices found that employees working as servers and kitchen staff at all three locations were paid wages which did not equal at least the hourly minimum wage and did not include proper compensation for overtime hours worked beyond 40 in a week. In addition, the defendants maintained false and incomplete records of employees' pay rates and hours worked. ""These workers suffered egregious labor violations,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""The Department of Labor is committed to using all tools available to recover workers' wages and ensure accountability under the law. By conducting FLSA investigations, we not only seek to assist vulnerable workers in sectors such as the restaurant industry, but also to level the playing field for all employers who obey the law."" The judgments, entered in the U.S. district courts for the Eastern and Southern districts of New York, require the defendants to pay the back wages and interest to the Wage and Hour Division, which will distribute the wages to the workers, and to pay the civil money penalties to the department. The judgments also prohibit the defendants from future violations of the FLSA's minimum wage, overtime and record-keeping provisions. Should the defendants fail to make timely payments, the department will file supplementary consent judgments seeking immediate payment. The FLSA requires that covered, nonexempt employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, as well as one and one-half times their regular rates for every hour they work beyond 40 per week. The law also requires employers to maintain accurate records of employees' wages, hours and other conditions of employment, and prohibits employers from retaliating against employees who exercise their rights under the law. The case was litigated for the department by its Regional Office of the Solicitor in New York.

These workers are entitled to receive the wages they have rightfully earned,"" said Cynthia Watson, regional administrator for the Wage and Hour Division in the Southwest. ""When an employer violates the FLSA, the Labor Department will not hesitate to take appropriate action to ensure workers receive the wages they have earned, and that employers who play by the rules do not operate at a competitive disadvantage to those who do not."" An investigation by the division's Oklahoma City District Office found that the employer failed to pay servers the required minimum wage of $2.13 per hour for tipped employees, and instead required them to work only for tips. The company also failed to maintain records of the numbers of hours worked by employees. Additionally, the employer failed to maintain records of dates of birth for workers under 18 years of age, as required by the FLSA. Peyton's Place has agreed to comply fully with the FLSA in the future and to pay the back wages found due in full. The FLSA requires that covered, nonexempt employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 for all hours worked, plus time and one-half their regular rates of pay for hours worked beyond 40 per week. In accordance with the FLSA, an employer of a tipped employee is required to pay no less than $2.13 per hour in direct wages, provided that amount plus the tips received equals at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. If an employee's tips combined with the employer's direct wages do not equal the minimum wage, the employer must make up the difference. Employers also are required to provide employees notice of the FLSA tip credit provisions, to maintain accurate time and payroll records and to comply with the hours, hazardous orders and other restrictions applying to workers under age 18. Additionally, deductions from an employee's pay for customer walkouts, breakage or cash register shortages are illegal if they reduce the employee's wages below the minimum wage.

An investigation by the division's New Orleans District Office found that Mahaffey Fabric Structures violated the SCA by failing to pay employees working at Fort Polk in Vernon Parris the proper prevailing wage rates and fringe benefits required for the categories of work performed. Investigators also determined that some employees were wrongly classified as laborers rather than general maintenance workers or forklift operators, which both require payment at higher rates. The employer violated CWHSSA when it failed to pay employees time and one-half of the required prevailing rates of pay for hours worked beyond 40 in a workweek. Memphis, Tenn.-based Mahaffey Fabric Structures, a tent and fabric structure rental company, has agreed to comply fully with the SCA and CWHSSA in the future. Back wages have been paid in full.

An investigation conducted by the division's Dallas District Office determined that the company required employees to record hours worked on two different time clocks at the same facility during the workweek, and then failed to combine those hours to determine when overtime was due. As a result, employees failed to receive an overtime premium of one and one-half times their regular rates of pay for hours worked beyond 40 in a workweek. Investigators found that employees were under contract by two separate staffing agencies simultaneously to provide services for Neiman, with hours worked Monday through Wednesday charged to one temporary help service, and hours worked by the same employees for the same employer Thursday through Sunday charged to another service. Additionally, investigators determined that some salaried employees were wrongly classified as exempt from receiving overtime; in fact, they were due overtime compensation. Nieman Printing has agreed to comply fully with the FLSA. Back wages and civil money penalties have been paid in full. The FLSA requires that covered, nonexempt employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour for all hours worked, plus time and one-half their regular rates, including commissions, bonuses and incentive pay, for hours worked beyond 40 per week. In general, hours worked includes all time an employee must be on duty, or on the employer's premises or at any other prescribed place of work, from the beginning of the first principal work activity to the end of the last principal activity of the workday. Additionally, the law requires that accurate records of employees' wages, hours and other conditions of employment be maintained. The FLSA provides an exemption from both minimum wage and overtime pay requirements for individuals employed in bona fide executive, administrative, professional and outside sales positions, as well as certain computer employees. To qualify for exemption, employees generally must meet certain tests regarding their job duties and be paid on a salary basis at not less than $455 per week. Job titles do not determine exempt status. For an exemption to apply, an employee's specific job duties and salary must meet all the requirements of the department's regulations.

"December 27, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20121227,MSHA announces results of November impact inspections,"ARLINGTON, Va. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration today announced that federal inspectors issued 285 citations, 11 orders and two safeguards during special impact inspections conducted at nine coal mines and seven metal/nonmetal mines last month. The monthly inspections, which began in force in April 2010 following the explosion at the Upper Big Branch Mine, involve mines that merit increased agency attention and enforcement due to their poor compliance history or particular compliance concerns. These matters include high numbers of violations or closure orders; frequent hazard complaints or hotline calls; plan compliance issues; inadequate workplace examinations; a high number of accidents, injuries or illnesses; fatalities; adverse conditions such as increased methane liberation, faulty roof conditions and inadequate ventilation; and respirable dust. For example, MSHA conducted an impact inspection at TRC Mining Corp. #2 mine in Letcher County, Ky., on Nov. 27. Enforcement personnel issued 23 citations and seven orders, including five unwarrantable failure orders and two failure-to-abate orders for previously issued citations. The orders closed the entire underground portion of the mine. Subsequent to this inspection, the mine operator changed the mine status to non-producing, with four miners working one shift per day. The operator also submitted a plan to remove equipment from the mine on Dec. 7 and to have the removal completed by Jan. 1, 2013. This was the third impact inspection at this mine. Five unwarrantable failure orders were issued for failure to follow the approved ventilation plan, failure to properly maintain and repair mine seals, and failure to conduct adequate pre-shift examinations. The operator's approved ventilation plan on the mechanized mining unit stipulates the installation of a line curtain within 14 feet of each working face with a minimum air quantity in all 10 entries. Mining was underway when inspectors arrived to find either no line curtain where required or line curtains in excess of the required 14 feet; at one point a line curtain was installed 35 feet from the face. No air movement could be detected behind the curtains in four entries, and they did not extend into the last open cross-cut to maintain the necessary minimum air quantity. The operator also did not properly maintain the water spray system – provided for the belt drive transfer point – in an operable condition. At the time of the inspection, coal was running on the belt line at this location. The water supply had been turned off at the cutoff valve (where the branch line connects to the main water line). The mine also was cited for violations of annual retraining requirements, inadequate roof support, no warning devices at the end of permanent roof support, blocked personnel doors along each side of the #1 beltline, pre-shift examinations not recorded, failure to maintain the primary intake escape way, accumulations of combustible material in areas of the mine, and improperly maintained mining and electrical equipment and fire suppression systems. ""We continue to identify operators who have not gotten the message,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""Exposure to harmful levels of respirable dust is unacceptable. Not conducting adequate examinations is unacceptable. Miners deserve better."" Also last month, MSHA conducted an impact inspection at the BHP Copper Inc., Pinto Valley Operation in Gila County, Ariz., where a miner was fatally injured in a fall in September. Federal inspectors issued 40 citations and 2 orders during the Nov. 6-21 inspection. Inspectors issued two unwarrantable failure orders during this inspection, one for failure to provide barricades or signs warning miners of fall hazard at the North Mine Pit, Castle Dome building. This standard has been cited five times in the past two years. A second such order was issued for not providing a barricade, railing, or barrier to prevent miners from over-traveling a steep, uneven, rocky dropoff located south of the Rectifier Building. Hazardous conditions resulted in six citations for damaged electrical conductors, exposing miners to electrical shock . This hazardous condition has been cited 14 times in the past two years at this mine. Five citations were issued for failure to conduct continuity and resistance testing of the grounding system on power cords, power strips, power supplies, and a portable band saw, exposing miner to possible electrical shock hazards. This standard has been cited 14 times in the past two years at this mine. Four citations were issued for improper storage of supplies, parts and materials, exposing miners to slip, trip, fall and fall of material hazards. This standard has been cited eight times in the past two years at this mine. Four citations were issued because high-pressure hoses located at the shop bay, electrician shop, primary crusher and secondary crusher building were not equipped with safety chains or locking devices to prevent a connection failure, creating the potential of a violent hose-whipping action if a hose came apart. This standard was cited one time in the past two years. Since April 2010, MSHA has conducted 539 impact inspections and issued 9,445 citations, 900 orders and 40 safeguards.

"December 26, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20121226,"US Department of Labor sues National Council of La Raza Action Fund Inc., ordering reinstatement of whistle-blower fired for mold exposure complaint","OSHA finds Orlando, Fla., employer in violation of OSH Act's Section 11(c) ORLANDO, Fla. – The U.S. Department of Labor has sued National Council of La Raza Action Fund Inc., successor to Democracia USA, a nonprofit community engagement and Hispanic voter registration organization in Orlando, for allegedly terminating an employee who raised health concerns about potential exposure to mold and other environmental factors in his workplace. The lawsuit follows an investigation by the department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration that found that the company unlawfully and intentionally terminated the worker for engaging in activity protected by Section 11(c) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act. The suit seeks to have the employee reinstated and paid back wages, interest, and compensatory and punitive damages, along with expunging adverse information in the employee's personnel records. Finally, it seeks to bar the employer from commission of future violations of the OSH Act by a permanent injunction. ""Every American worker has the right to raise health concerns regarding potential exposures to environmental hazards, such as mold, without fearing retaliation,"" said Cindy Coe, OSHA's regional administrator in Atlanta. ""We will continue to ensure that these basic worker rights are protected and will prosecute every employer found to have violated them."" In mid-September 2009, the employee began reporting concerns to management about potential exposure to mold and other environmental factors in the workplace, which were making him sick. In November 2009, an air quality test was performed that showed the presence of mold in the workplace. The office was closed for several months. After it reopened, the employee filed a health complaint with the OSHA Tampa Area Office. OSHA conducted an inspection and issued a citation against the employer for violation of OSHA's housekeeping standard. Upon receipt of the OSHA citation, the employee was informed that his employment was terminated. The employee then filed a whistle-blower complaint with OSHA. The department is represented in court by its Regional Office of the Solicitor in Atlanta. The suit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, Orlando Division. OSHA enforces the whistle-blower provisions of the OSH Act and 21 other statutes protecting employees who report violations of various commercial motor vehicle; airline; nuclear; pipeline; environmental; railroad; public transportation; maritime; consumer product; health care reform; securities; food safety; and consumer financial reform regulations. Employees who believe that they have been retaliated against for engaging in protected conduct may file a complaint with the secretary of labor for an investigation by OSHA's Whistle-blower Protection Program. Detailed information on employee whistle-blower rights is available online at http://www.whistleblowers.gov . To ask questions, obtain compliance assistance, file a complaint or report workplace hospitalizations, fatalities or situations posing imminent danger to workers, the public should call OSHA's toll-free hotline at 800-321-OSHA (6742) or the agency's Tampa Area Office at 813-626-1177. Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. OSHA's role is to ensure these conditions for America's working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education and assistance.

"December 20, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20121220,US Department of Labor provides grant supplement to assist West Virginia with continued health insurance payments for jobless workers,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Labor today announced the award of a $1.2 million National Emergency Grant supplement to WorkForce West Virginia. The supplement will enable the state to continue funding partial premium payments for health insurance coverage for qualified unemployed individuals and expand the number of people served. ""Health insurance is incredibly important, not just for workers, but for their families,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""The additional federal funds announced today will provide continued assistance to dislocated workers so they won't be without health insurance while they search for new jobs."" The supplement will allow West Virginia to provide two to three months of ""gap filler"" payments for unemployed individuals who are receiving Trade Adjustment Assistance benefits and are eligible for the Health Coverage Tax Credit program. Under the program, eligible individuals can receive 72.5 percent of premium costs for qualified health insurance programs. These payments cover the period of time it takes to complete Internal Revenue Service enrollment, processing and first payments under the HCTC program. A National Emergency Grant in the amount of $500,000 was awarded to the state of West Virginia on March 28, 2011. Today's supplemental award of $1.2 million brings the total funding awarded to West Virginia to provide HCTC gap filler payments to $1.7 million. The supplement will enable payments for additional workers, bringing the total number of workers served to about 1,000, including some Ohio workers dislocated from Severstal/RG Steel facilities. National Emergency Grants are part of the secretary of labor's discretionary fund and are awarded based on a state's ability to meet specific guidelines.

"December 20, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ilab/ilab20121220,US secretary of labor releases report on Bahrains labor complianceu,"WASHINGTON — Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis today released a report on Bahrain's compliance with its labor commitments under the U.S.-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement. The report concludes that, while the government of Bahrain has instituted important mechanisms to address issues stemming from the 2011 unrest in Bahrain, it appears to have acted inconsistently with the Labor Chapter of the FTA in its response to that unrest. The report recommends consultations between the United States and Bahrain under the Labor Chapter and offers recommendations to serve as a road map for a collaborative discussion and a positive resolution of the issues. The report responds to a submission filed by the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations with the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of International Labor Affairs Office of Trade and Labor Affairs. The report recognizes that the Bahraini government, in particular the minister of labor, has made significant efforts to ensure reinstatement of all but a few hundred of roughly 2,700 workers fired following the unrest in February and March 2011. Nevertheless, the report also finds that the government of Bahrain appears to have acted inconsistently with its commitments to strive to ensure that its laws recognize and protect freedom of association and the elimination of employment discrimination, to ensure that its laws provide for standards consistent with internationally recognized labor rights and to improve those laws. The government of Bahrain did not take steps to remedy shortcomings in its laws on freedom of association and employment discrimination, applied those laws to the detriment of workers' rights in the wake of the March 2011 general strike and subsequently passed amendments that weaken freedom of association protections. Specifically, the report details that, in the widespread dismissals after the March 2011 general strike, trade unionists and leaders were targeted for firing and at times criminal prosecution for their role in the strike, and Shia workers and political critics of the government faced discrimination. The report notes that the reinstatement process for these dismissed workers has raised additional concerns of violations of freedom of association and political and sectarian-based discrimination against Shia workers, which reflect the larger context of a deteriorating labor rights environment in Bahrain. Secretary Solis explained, ""It is our duty to ensure that trading partners meet their commitments to labor standards in free trade agreements. We at the Department of Labor, and throughout the Obama administration, take this responsibility very seriously, and this report reflects that. We are hopeful that through engagement with our trading partner we will find a solution that is good for workers both in the United States and Bahrain.""

This follows an Employee Benefits Security Administration investigation that revealed alleged violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The suit alleges that from December 2007 through August 2010, the defendants permitted a series of transfers from the accounts of two profit-sharing plans and one 401(k) plan to satisfy corporate debt. Additionally, it is alleged that between January 2006 and November 2010, the defendants failed to remit employee contributions to the 401(k) plan and remitted certain contributions late, resulting in lost interest. “These violations represent a clear breach of fiduciary duty,” said Marc Machiz, regional director of the EBSA in Philadelphia. “Employees should expect that their hard-earned savings will be properly managed when they contribute to retirement plans.” Filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, the suit seeks to restore to the plan all losses, including interest and opportunity costs. The suit also seeks to permanently bar the defendants from serving in a fiduciary capacity to any employee benefit plan covered by ERISA and to appoint an independent fiduciary to manage the plans. The department’s legal action resulted from an investigation by EBSA’s Washington District Office. It is being litigated by the department’s Regional Office of the Solicitor in Philadelphia. Employers and workers can contact EBSA at 215-861-5300 or toll-free at 866-444-3272 for help with problems relating to private sector retirement and health plans.

"December 19, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ilab/ilab20121219,US Department of Labor awards $5.35 million to implement forced child labor projects in Brazil and Peru,"WASHINGTON — Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis today announced a $5.35 million grant to support efforts by the governments of Brazil and Peru to combat forced labor, including forced child labor. The grant awarded by the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of International Labor Affairs will fund a project implemented by the International Labor Organization. ""Forced labor is an abhorrent practice that cannot be tolerated,"" said Secretary Solis. ""This grant will help facilitate the sharing and implementation of proven strategies for eradicating these abuses across countries."" This project will build upon Brazil's pioneering efforts to combat forced labor through a trilateral partnership with the United States, Brazil and Peru. In Brazil, the project will support national efforts to build capacity in selected states and sectors where forced labor persists. Under this project, victims and their households will be linked to social and livelihood programs. In Peru, the project will share good practices developed in Brazil to strengthen Peru's ongoing efforts to combat forced labor, including of children. Since 1995, ILAB projects have rescued approximately 1.5 million children from exploitive child labor. The Labor Department has funded 260 such projects implemented by more than 65 organizations in 91 countries. ILAB currently oversees more than $210 million of active programming to combat the worst forms of child labor. More information is available at http://www.dol.gov/ilab/ ."
"December 19, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20121219,"South Carolina San Jose Mexican restaurant establishments agree to pay nearly $391,000 in back wages to 37 workers following US Labor Department investigation","Wage and Hour Division personnel find systemic wage violations at 3 locations COLUMBIA, S.C. — Three San Jose Mexican restaurants establishments, individually owned and operated by Eraclio Leon, Gregorio Leon Sr. and Antonio Leon, have agreed to pay 37 employees $390,960 in back wages following an investigation by the U.S. Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division, which found violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act's overtime, minimum wage and record-keeping provisions. These violations were disclosed at the following locations: San Jose Restaurant Mexicano, doing business as Eric's San Jose Mexican Restaurant #3 in Columbia; San Jose Mexican Restaurant #13 in Lexington; and San Jose Mexican Restaurant #20 in Columbia. The investigations were conducted under the division's multiyear enforcement initiative focused on the restaurant industry in South Carolina, where widespread noncompliance with the FLSA's minimum wage, overtime and record-keeping provisions has been found. Since fiscal year 2009, the agency's Columbia District Office has concluded more than 300 restaurant investigations, resulting in the recovery of more than $2.5 million in back wages for more than 2,500 workers. ""We found many low-wage and vulnerable workers employed at all three San Jose Mexican restaurant locations. Many of them worked long hours, sometimes averaging 63 hours a week, but earned far below the federal minimum wage and no overtime compensation,"" said Michelle Garvey, director of the division's Columbia office. ""We are pleased that these workers finally will be paid their rightful wages, and through the efforts of our ongoing enforcement initiative, the Wage and Hour Division continues to focus on South Carolina restaurants to protect workers against widespread labor violations and ensure a level playing field for law-abiding employers."" The FLSA violations found at all three restaurants resulted from the employers' failure to properly compensate employees for all work hours. By reviewing payroll records and conducting employee interviews, investigators determined that tipped employees, such as servers, were made to rely primarily on tips for pay, and were paid direct wages below $2.13 per hour, in violation of the FLSA's minimum wage provision. Additionally, other employees, such as kitchen staff, were paid flat salaries each month — without regard to hours worked — that did not satisfy minimum wage or overtime pay requirements. The employers also failed to maintain accurate records of employees' work hours and wages, as required. Earlier this year, the division investigated another San Jose Mexican restaurant establishment located on Sparkleberry Lane in Columbia and found similar FLSA violations. Following the investigation, restaurant owner and operator Gregorio Leon Jr. agreed to pay $170,666 in back wages to 11 employees who were denied minimum wage and overtime compensation for all hours worked. In addition to paying the back wages owed in this case, the restaurants agreed to maintain future compliance with the FLSA by keeping accurate records of employees' work hours, wages and other required employment information; paying all employees at least the federal minimum wage; and providing overtime compensation and informing employees in advance that the tip credit will be used. The restaurant industry employs some of our country's lowest-paid workers who, due to a lack of knowledge of the law or an unwillingness to exercise their rights, are vulnerable to disparate treatment and labor violations. In addition to the initiative in South Carolina, the Wage and Hour Division has other ongoing enforcement initiatives throughout the U.S. to identify and remedy violations that are common in the restaurant industry. The FLSA requires that covered, nonexempt employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 for all hours worked, plus time and one-half their regular rates for hours worked beyond 40 per week. In accordance with the FLSA, an employer of a tipped employee is required to pay at least $2.13 an hour in direct wages, provided that amount plus tips received equals at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. If an employee's tips combined with the employer's direct wages do not equal the minimum wage, the employer must make up the difference. Employers also are required to provide employees notice of the FLSA tip credit provisions, maintain accurate time and payroll records, and comply with restrictions that apply to workers under age 18. Accessible and searchable information on enforcement activities by the Department of Labor is available at http://ogesdw.dol.gov/search/. Publicly available enforcement data are available through the free mobile application ""Eat Shop Sleep,"" which enables consumers, employees and other members of the public to check if a hotel, restaurant or retail location has been investigated by the Wage and Hour Division and whether FLSA violations were found.

The investigation included two AutoCricket locations in Riviera Beach and Cordele, Ga. Investigators found that the employer deducted short rest periods as non-work hours from the employee totals of hours worked. Failure to pay for that break time, which is compensable work time under the FLSA, resulted in the workers being paid less than the minimum wage of $7.25 per hour for all their hours worked. Additionally, the employer paid overtime for hours worked in excess of 80 during a biweekly pay period, instead of paying workers time and one-half for all hours worked beyond 40 in a seven-day workweek, as required by the FLSA. ""Rest periods of short duration are common in the workplace, and employers should not deduct this time from employees' pay,"" said Will Garnitz, director of the Wage and Hour Division's Miami District Office. ""Employers are required to pay employees for all hours worked, including overtime compensation, when they exceed 40 hours in a workweek. This case should put other employers on notice to ensure that they are paying their employees in compliance with the FLSA."" The employer has agreed to comply with the FLSA in the future, to correct all violations identified by this investigation and to pay the back wages owed in full. AutoCricket.com is a Web-based company that provides services related to buying, financing and insuring motor vehicles. The FLSA requires that covered, nonexempt employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour for all hours worked, plus time and one-half their regular rates, including commissions, bonuses and incentive pay, for hours worked beyond 40 per week. In general, ""hours worked"" includes all time an employee must be on duty, or on the employer's premises or at any other prescribed place of work, from the beginning of the first principal work activity to the end of the last principal activity of the workday. The department has a smart phone application to help employees independently track the hours they work and determine the wages they are owed. Available in English and Spanish, users can track regular work hours, break times and any overtime hours for one or more employers. This new technology is significant because, instead of relying on their employers' records, workers now can keep their own records.

The judgment resolves a lawsuit filed by the U.S. Labor Department based on the findings of an investigation by the department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration. The investigation determined that both Dombek III and Dombek Jr. violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act by improperly managing the company’s benefit plans’ assets. “Failing to administer health insurance premiums properly demonstrates a total lack of concern for employees and their families,” said Steve Haugen, director of EBSA’s Chicago Regional Office. “Incorporating employees’ voluntary salary contributions into the general assets of a company and failing to forward them to the retirement plan are violations of both the law and the trust workers have placed in their employers.” Dombek III, who is president of the JJD Industries Group, and Dombek Jr. were co-fiduciaries of the Wisconsin Tool & Stamping Co. 401(k) plan and have been ordered to restore $22,164.45 in unremitted contributions and lost opportunity costs to the plan. Dombek III is also liable for an additional $2,222.78 in unremitted contributions and lost opportunity costs to the J.D. Acquisition 401(k) plan. Dombek III must also restore $45,134.08 in unremitted contributions and lost opportunity costs to the JJD Industries sponsored group health plan. The company contracted with Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois to provide health and dental benefits to the employees of its related companies, including Wisconsin Tool & Stamping Co., J.D. Acquisition Corp., Akorat Metal Fabricators Inc./Smithco Fabricators Inc. and Pavo Inc./Injection Plastics Corp. The companies paid their premiums separately, and premiums were partially funded through weekly employee payroll deductions. Dombek Jr. and Dombek III have been barred from serving as fiduciaries or service providers to any employee benefit plan subject to ERISA for a period of five years. An independent fiduciary will oversee the termination of the 401(k) plans of both Wisconsin Tool & Stamping and J.D. Acquisition, as well as the distribution of plan assets to eligible participants. Dombek Jr. and Dombek III have both previously filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection. The secretary of labor filed separate complaints to determine the dischargeability of these obligations and seek the enforcement of any monetary judgment against both individuals to restore the funds to the employee benefit programs. On Oct. 5 and Oct. 16, 2012, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Illinois granted the department’s motions for default judgment, finding that the debts Dombek Jr. and Dombek III owed to the plans were not dischargeable in bankruptcy.

"December 18, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20121218,"Casa Guadalupe to pay more than $121,000 in back wages, damages and penalties for willful labor law violations","Federal judge orders payment following US Department of Labor lawsuit against San Francisco grocer SAN FRANCISCO — Casa Guadalupe, a local San Francisco grocery store chain, has been ordered to pay $110,071 in overtime back wages and liquidated damages to 25 current and former employees of its three Mission District stores. A U.S. District Court judge ordered the payment following an investigation by the U.S. Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division, which disclosed that Pedro Gil, owner of the local chain, violated the Fair Labor Standards Act. The department also assessed $11,687 in civil money penalties against the employer because of the willful and repeat nature of the labor violations. Gil admitted that he knowingly did not pay the required overtime wages. Federal investigators found similar violations of the FLSA during a previous investigation that determined $6,496 in overtime back wages were due to three workers. ""This employer's deliberate disregard for the law and for workers' rights is inexcusable,"" said Susana Blanco, director of the Wage and Hour Division's San Francisco District Office. ""The affected employees will now get the overtime wages that they were entitled to receive by law. This lawsuit demonstrates the department's commitment to use every enforcement tool necessary to bring such employers to justice and to ensure that workers are paid the wages they have rightfully earned."" The order resolves a lawsuit filed by the department against Casa Guadalupe and Gil in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The suit maintained that employees were paid at their regular hourly rates and did not receive the required overtime premium of one and one-half times their regular rates of pay for hours worked beyond 40 per week. In addition, the employer did not maintain records of the hours employees worked, in violation of the FLSA. The court order prohibits Casa Guadalupe and its owner from committing future FLSA violations, requires the employer to conduct managerial FLSA training, to hire a third-party monitor to conduct audits of compliance for the next three years, and to post legal notices in English and Spanish to all employees regarding the disclosed violations. The FLSA requires that covered, nonexempt employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour for all hours worked, as well as one and one-half times their regular hourly rates of pay for every hour they work beyond 40 per week. The law also requires employers to maintain accurate records of employees' wages, hours and other conditions of employment, and prohibits employers from retaliating against employees who exercise their rights. The FLSA provides that employers who violate the law are, as a general rule, liable to employees for their back wages and an equal amount in liquidated damages. Liquidated damages are paid directly to the affected employees. The department was represented in the lawsuit by its Regional Office of the Solicitor in San Francisco. For more information about the requirements of the FLSA, call the Wage and Hour Division's toll-free helpline at 866-4US-WAGE (487-9243) or contact the division's San Francisco office at 415-625-7720.

""Encouraging businesses to reduce child and forced labor in their supply chains helps advance fundamental human rights that are at the core of worker dignity, whether here in the U.S. or abroad,"" Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis said in a video message announcing the toolkit. The free, easy-to-use toolkit was unveiled during an event at Labor Department headquarters for representatives of government, industry, labor and civil society organizations that are at the forefront of efforts to prevent labor abuses in the production of goods. Speakers included Carol Pier, acting deputy undersecretary of ILAB; Eric Biel, acting associate deputy undersecretary of ILAB; and David Abramowitz, vice president of policy and government relations at Humanity United. The toolkit highlights the need for a social compliance program that integrates a company's policies and practices to ensure that the company addresses child labor and forced labor throughout its supply chain. It provides practical, step-by-step guidance on eight critical elements that will be helpful for companies that do not have a social compliance system in place or those needing to strengthen existing systems. An integrated social compliance system includes: engaging stakeholders and partners, assessing risks and impacts, developing a code of conduct, communicating and training across the supply chain, monitoring compliance, remediating violations, independent review and reporting performance. ILAB created the toolkit as part of its responsibility under the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2005.

"December 13, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20121213,"Extensive violations of federal, state laws found among garment contractors at Los Angeles Fashion District location","Shops producing garments sold by major retailers underpaid 185 workers by $326,000 LOS ANGELES — The U.S. Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division and the California Division of Labor Standards Enforcement found serious violations of federal and state labor laws by each of 10 garment contractors inspected during a sweep of a single building in the Los Angeles Fashion District earlier this year. Division investigators found widespread violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act's minimum wage, overtime and record-keeping provisions, resulting in the recovery of more than $326,200 in back wages for 185 employees. The garments being produced by violators were destined for sale at more than 30 retailers nationwide, including Aldo Group Inc., Burlington Coat Factory Warehouse Corp., Charlotte Russe Holding Inc., Dillard's Inc., Forever 21 Inc., Frasier Clothing Co. (Susan Lawrence), HSN Inc. (Home Shopping Network), Rainbow Apparel Inc., Ross Stores Inc., TJX Cos. Inc. (TJ Maxx and Marshall's), Urban Outfitters Inc. and Wet Seal Inc. ""The extent of the violations discovered by these investigations was disappointing. Retailers need to actively ensure that clothes produced in the U.S. for sale to the American public are made by workers who are paid at least the U.S. minimum wage and proper overtime,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""Federal, state, local and industry stakeholders can work together to foster a vibrant, and compliant, domestic fashion industry."" ""The garment industry is a vital part of the economy of Los Angeles and California,"" said Julie Su, California's labor commissioner. ""State law prohibits garment manufacturers from operating without a proper license, from violating state minimum wage and overtime laws, and from playing shell games to avoid paying workers properly. We are intent on making sure that sweatshop practices are eliminated so that consumers can proudly purchase garments made in L.A., honest companies can compete and garment workers can thrive."" Teams of federal and state investigators conducted unannounced investigations of employers operating out a large garment building at 830 S. Hill St. in downtown Los Angeles, where previous investigations had revealed significant labor violations and sweatshop-like employment conditions. Investigators found many garment employees were paid a piece rate — that is, paid for each piece they sewed or cut — without regard to minimum wage or overtime pay requirements. On average, workers' wages amounted to less than $6.50 per hour — well below the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour and the California minimum wage of $8 per hour. None of these employees received the overtime premium of time and one-half their regular rates of pay for hours worked over 40 per week, as required under the FLSA. Significant record-keeping violations also were disclosed, including falsified time cards and under-reporting or failing to maintain accurate records of actual hours worked by garment employees. The ""hot goods"" provision of the FLSA prohibits the shipment in interstate commerce of goods that were produced in violation of the act's minimum wage, overtime or child labor provisions. Upon determining that garments were produced in violation of the FLSA, the division requested that the garment contractors voluntarily not ship the goods until the violations were resolved. Several manufacturers, for whom the violators were producing goods, paid a portion of the back wages due, after which the division lifted its objection to the shipment of the goods. State investigators issued citations to three establishments not registered as garment contractors and cited the shops for failing to provide itemized deductions, pay the state minimum wage or comply with state overtime pay requirements. The investigations conducted at this location are part of the Wage and Hour Division's multi-year enforcement initiative focused on Southern California's garment industry, in which it historically has found consistent and widespread violations of the FLSA's minimum wage, overtime and record-keeping provisions. The initiative is concentrating on employers in Los Angeles and Orange counties, including those operating out of large garment buildings in the city's Fashion District. For more information about the initiative, see the division's Aug. 8 press release at http://www.dol.gov/whd/media/press/whdpressVB3.asp?pressdoc=Western/20120808.xml . The FLSA requires that covered employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour as well as time and one-half their regular rates for hours worked over 40 per week. In general, ""hours worked"" includes all time an employee must be on duty, or on the employer's premises or at any other prescribed place of work, from the beginning of the first principal work activity to the end of the last principal activity of the workday. Additionally, the law requires that accurate records of employees' wages, hours and other conditions of employment be maintained. California's minimum wage is $8 per hour, higher than the U.S. minimum wage, and overtime pay is required after eight hours worked in a day under state law. California employers are subject to both standards.

Employees of Litchfield roofing contractor Michael Cahoon, doing business as High & Dry Roofing, were exposed to potentially deadly or disabling falls from a two-story residential roof that lacked fall protection. As the result of an inspection of a Hampton work site by Concord Area Office personnel from the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration, citations were issued for alleged willful and serious safety violations. The company faces a total of $118,500 in proposed fines for the violations. Willful violations include working without hard hats and proper fall protection, as well as workers improperly using extension ladders that did not extend 3 feet above the upper landing surface. A willful violation is one committed with intentional, knowing or voluntary disregard for the law's requirements, or with plain indifference to worker safety and health. The proposed penalties for the willful violations total $108,000. Serious violations include working on scaffolding without proper fall protection; scaffold planking that did not have sufficient overlap; scaffold planking that did not have an adequate cantilever in place; as well as an unguarded belt and pulleys on a compressor that was tagged out of service. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known. The total proposed penalties for the serious violations are $10,500. ""OSHA has cited this employer for fall-related hazards three previous times at work sites in New Hampshire and Maine, yet these hazards are allowed to recur,"" said Rosemarie Ohar, OSHA's area director for New Hampshire. ""These hazards could have been prevented by planning ahead to do the job safely, providing workers with proper equipment and training them to recognize and address fall hazards."" With falls as the leading cause of death in construction work, OSHA is calling upon employers in New Hampshire to take effective action to reduce and minimize fall hazards. ""Falls are the No. 1 killer in construction work, having taken the lives of more than 250 of this nation's construction workers in 2010 – the latest data available,"" said Marthe Kent, OSHA's regional administrator for New England. ""To help stop this needless loss of life, OSHA has launched a campaign to remind employers and employees alike of what they can do to eliminate fall hazards at their work sites."" OSHA and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health are working with trade associations, labor unions, employers, universities, community and faith-based organizations and consulates to provide employers and workers – especially vulnerable, low-literacy workers – with education and training on common-sense fall prevention equipment and strategies that save lives. OSHA has also created a new fall prevention Web page at http://www.osha.gov/stopfalls that has detailed information in English and Spanish on fall protection standards. The page includes fact sheets, posters and fall prevention videos that vividly illustrate various fall hazards and appropriate preventive measures. The citations can be viewed at: http://www.osha.gov/ooc/citations/MichaelCahoon_dba_HighandDryRoofing_435951_1106_12.pdf . Employers have 15 business days from receipt of their citations and proposed penalties to comply, meet with OSHA or contest the findings before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. To ask questions, obtain compliance assistance, file a complaint, or report workplace hospitalizations, fatalities or situations posing imminent danger to workers, the public should call OSHA's toll-free hotline at 800-321-OSHA (6742) or the agency's Concord office at 603-225-1629. Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees.

The company failed to pay employees the prevailing wage rates and fringe benefits required by DBRA for work on federally-funded construction contracts. ""Employers enter into federal contracts knowing that they are required to pay prevailing wages and benefits to workers in accordance with federal guidelines for the localities in which they live"" said Cynthia Watson, regional administrator for the Wage and Hour Division in the Southwest. ""Enforcement of the prevailing wage laws levels the playing field for all contractors. Our investigation of this firm demonstrates the department's commitment to enforcing these laws to protect both employers and employees. We will continue to use all of the enforcement tools at our disposal to ensure that taxpayer dollars used to fund such contracts are properly spent."" The investigation by the Wage and Hour Division's Tulsa District Office personnel determined that Third Generation Electric failed to pay employees the required wages and fringe benefits applicable to the classifications of work they performed while working as a subcontractor on an American Recovery and Reinvestment Act-funded contract. The contract was to construct a new water treatment plant in Tahlequah and a demilitarization processing center at the U.S. Army Ammunition Plant in McAlester. The company agreed to future compliance with the DBRA. Back wages have been paid in full. The DBRA requires all contractors and subcontractors performing work on federal and certain federally-funded projects to pay their laborers and mechanics the proper prevailing wage rates and fringe benefits as determined by the secretary of labor.

Under these initiatives, personnel from the division's San Francisco and Los Angeles District Offices conducted several restaurant investigations in 2012. They recovered $672,333 in unpaid minimum wages and overtime compensation for 273 employees working as cooks, bussers, servers and other restaurant staff. Wage and Hour Division investigators conducted thorough reviews of payroll records and employment practices, in addition to employee interviews to assess employer compliance with all applicable labor standards. Common FLSA violations uncovered during these investigations include not paying employees for all hours worked, such as pre-shift and post-shift work; paying employees cash wages ""off the books;"" paying fixed salaries for all hours worked, without regard to minimum wage and overtime requirements; missing payroll or failing to pay employees on scheduled pay days; and not maintaining accurate records of employees' wages and work hours. ""We have found widespread labor violations among restaurants in well-known tourist areas in San Francisco and throughout Los Angeles County. This culture of noncompliance adversely impacts the wages and working conditions of many low-wage, vulnerable workers,"" said Ruben Rosalez, regional administrator for the Wage and Hour Division in the West. ""We are pleased that these employees — many of whom worked 10-hour shifts, five to six days per week — will finally be paid their rightful wages. As demonstrated by the success of our ongoing initiatives, we are committed to strengthening FLSA compliance in the restaurant industry to protect workers and ensure a level playing field for the many employers who abide by the law and properly pay their employees."" The FLSA requires that covered employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, as well as time and one-half their regular rates for hours worked over 40 per week. The law also requires employers to maintain accurate records of employees' wages, hours and other conditions of employment, and prohibits employers from retaliating against employees who exercise their rights under the law. The FLSA provides that employers who violate the law are, as a general rule, liable to employees for back wages and an equal amount in liquidated damages. The department has a smart phone application to help employees independently track the hours they work and determine the wages they are owed. Available in English and Spanish, users can conveniently track regular work hours, break time and any overtime hours for one or more employers. This new technology is significant because, instead of solely relying on their employers' records, workers can now keep their own records. This and other Labor Department apps are available at www.dol.gov/whd/ . Information on establishments investigated under the ongoing restaurant initiative will be included in the division's enforcement database, which can be viewed online at www.dol.gov/whd/ . It is also accessible via the ""Eat Shop Sleep"" smart phone app, which can be found on the Labor Department's app Web page. Consumers, employees and other members of the public can use the app to learn if a restaurant, hotel or retail establishment has been investigated by the division, and whether FLSA violations were found. Businesses will have a greater incentive to comply with the law now that their compliance track records are publicly available.

"December 11, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20121211,"US Department of Labor proposes rule to help retirees, workers of bankrupt companies get retirement money sooner","WASHINGTON — The U.S Department of Labor's Employee Benefits Security Administration today announced a proposed rule and related class exemption that will make it easier for Chapter 7 bankruptcy trustees to distribute assets from bankrupt companies' retirement plans. The proposal would allow such trustees to use EBSA's existing Abandoned Plan Program to terminate, wind up and distribute benefits from such plans. The existing Abandoned Plan Program provides streamlined termination and distribution procedures for abandoned individual account plans, including 401(k) plans, under which benefits may be distributed in a manner that can substantially reduce fees charged to participants' accounts for, among other things, annual reporting, legal compliance and other administrative services, including termination costs. By making this streamlined process available to Chapter 7 bankruptcy trustees, the time and resources required to ""wind up"" a bankrupt company's retirement plan can be significantly reduced. As a result, plan participants likely will see fewer administrative and termination fees charged to their accounts and should have access to their money sooner. ""The rule we're proposing today is designed to help workers and retirees of bankrupt companies gain access to their retirement money sooner. Far too often, the retired workers of these companies are unable to obtain their hard-earned retirement savings in a timely way. The legal status of a former employer should not impede retirees' access to their own funds, especially at the very time they need them most,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Employee Benefits Security Phyllis C. Borzi. ""The proposed rule would extend the department's current Abandoned Plan Program to these retirement plans, and enable Chapter 7 bankruptcy trustees to more quickly and efficiently distribute retirement benefits to participants. The rule also would reduce the possibility of participants' accounts being eroded by excessive and unnecessary fees."" Under amendments in 2005 to federal bankruptcy law, if a company in liquidation administered an individual account retirement plan, the company's Chapter 7 bankruptcy trustee must perform those functions. The Abandoned Plan Program, established in 2006, provides specific guidance on when a plan may be considered abandoned, who may make that determination, and exactly how to terminate the affairs of the plan and make benefit distributions. The program also limits potential fiduciary liability of financial institutions that step in to terminate and wind up plans that have been abandoned by their sponsors.

""He was being modest, of course, since one of his 'enthusiasms' was worker health and safety. And as the nation's 12th secretary of labor, he leaves an extraordinary legacy in this area. ""Under his leadership, the Occupational Safety and Health Act was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Nixon. 'Safety was extremely important in aircraft plants,' the former Lockheed executive once said, 'but as I went around looking at other industries, I was just appalled at the conditions I saw.' Today, the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration – the agency he envisioned and built – employs more than 2,200 people and strives to keep nearly 8 million U.S. workplaces safe and healthy through setting and enforcing standards and by providing training, outreach, education and assistance. ""During his tenure, Secretary Hodgson also led a major expansion of employment and training programs to stem the post-Vietnam War recession through the Emergency Employment Act of 1971. ""He continued his public service on an international scale and with great distinction after leaving the Labor Department, serving as U.S. ambassador to Japan during the Ford administration.

""November's jobs report means we've now seen 33 straight months of private sector job growth totaling nearly 5.6 million jobs. This year, we've created an average of 154,000 private sector jobs a month. ""Job gains were reported last month in nearly every hiring category. Hiring in the business and professional services sector is back to its pre-recession peak. Consumer confidence is high, and Americans are shopping again. Last month retailers added 53,000 jobs in anticipation of increased holiday sales. ""While Hurricane Sandy did not affect the unemployment rate, it did result in 1.5 million Americans experiencing some sort of disruption in employment. Families have lost their homes and possessions, and communities have lost businesses and public infrastructure. It's more critical than ever for America to rebuild. Hurricane Sandy underscores the need to repair our crumbling infrastructure and why it's so important for Congress to act on President Obama's plan to create a national infrastructure bank and put our construction workers back on the job. ""There's more work to be done, but our economic recovery remains on the right trajectory. More than ever, the American people need Washington to work for them and offer solutions.

Employee Stock Ownership Plan after the plan allegedly was allowed to purchase overvalued company stock. The suit names as defendants Rembar owner and CEO Frank Firor and First Bankers Trust Services Inc., which was hired as an independent fiduciary and trustee in connection with the company's newly formed plan. The plan is also a defendant. ""Employee Retirement Income Security Act fiduciary duties are the highest standard of care known to the law and apply to those who manage employee benefit plans,"" said Jonathan Kay, regional director of the Labor Department's Employee Benefits Security Administration's New York Regional Office. ""The department remains committed to ensuring that fiduciaries work solely in the interest of plan participants and beneficiaries."" The suit alleges that, in June 2005, First Bankers Trust Services allowed the plan to purchase 100 percent of the company's stock from Firor and Firor's relatives for $15.5 million. An investigation by EBSA determined that First Bankers Trust Services failed to comply with its duty to understand the valuation report that set the purchase price, identify and question assumptions in the report, and verify that the conclusions in the report were consistent with the company's financial data. As a result of First Bankers Trust Services' failure to comply with its fiduciary duties, the plan overpaid for the stock and suffered losses. The suit seeks, among other things, to recover jointly from First Bankers Trust Services and Firor all losses suffered by the plan. Rembar Inc. is engaged in the distribution and manufacturing of precision parts made from refractory metals. The suit was filed in the U.S. Court for the Southern District of New York and is being litigated by the department's Regional Office of the Solicitor in Manhattan.

"December 5, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20121205,"US Labor Department recovers more than $140,000 for Wisconsin-based B & K Builders' employee benefit plans","Marshfield, Wisconsin – The U.S. Department of Labor has recovered more than $140,000 for two employee benefit plans sponsored by B & K Builders Inc. of Marshfield. Pursuant to today's entry of a consent order and judgment by the court, the department has recovered $117,430.85 from the company and one of its co-owners, Kenneth Staab, to restore losses to the company's prevailing wage plan. This is in addition to more than $22,000 restored to the company's 401(k) profit-sharing plan in March. The consent order resolves a lawsuit filed as a result of an investigation by the department's Employee Benefits Security Administration into alleged violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The department alleged in its complaint that Staab and Robert Aschenbrenner, the other co-owner of B & K Builders, caused losses to both benefit plans. ""The Labor Department is committed to ensuring that workers keep what they earn and to recovering funds when they are mishandled,"" said Steve Haugen, EBSA's regional director in Chicago. ""We will continue to hold fiduciaries accountable when they ignore their responsibilities and put workers' hard-earned retirement income at risk."" The amount restored to the prevailing wage plan represented alleged unremitted employer contributions due to the plan between June 2007 and June 2009, and associated lost opportunity costs. The plan had 25 active participants and $46,773 in assets as of March 31. The $117,430.85 of unremitted contributions was restored on Oct. 9. Staab restored $22,847.86 in what the department alleged were unremitted employee contributions and lost opportunity costs to the company's 401(k) profit-sharing plan this March. The department alleged that the company retained the contributions, withheld from workers' paychecks between June 2005 and May 2008, instead of forwarding them on to the plan, as required under ERISA. The plan had 52 active participants and $143,720 in assets as of March 31. The restoration of losses to both employee benefit plans totals $140,278.71. The court order permanently bars Staab from serving as a fiduciary to any ERISA-covered plan in the future, and it removed him from his fiduciary role for both plans. B & K Builders ceased operating before the suit was filed. The court appointed an independent fiduciary to administer the plans and to ensure that the money recovered will be paid to plan participants who were harmed. The investigation was conducted by EBSA's Chicago Regional Office personnel. Employers and workers can contact the office at 312-353-0900. The case was litigated by the department's solicitor's office in Chicago.

The online form will provide workers who have been retaliated against an additional way to reach out for OSHA assistance online. ""The ability of workers to speak out and exercise their rights without fear of retaliation provides the backbone for some of American workers' most essential protections,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health Dr. David Michaels. ""Whistleblower laws protect not only workers, but also the public at large and now workers will have an additional avenue available to file a complaint with OSHA."" Currently, workers can make complaints to OSHA by filing a written complaint or by calling the agency's 1-800-321-OSHA (6742) number or an OSHA regional or area office. Workers will now be able to electronically submit a whistleblower complaint to OSHA by visiting www.osha.gov/whistleblower/WBComplaint.html (link is external) . The new online form prompts the worker to include basic whistleblower complaint information so they can be easily contacted for follow-up. Complaints are automatically routed to the appropriate regional whistleblower investigators. In addition, the complaint form can also be downloaded and submitted to the agency in hard-copy format by fax, mail or hand-delivery. The paper version is identical to the electronic version and requests the same information necessary to initiate a whistleblower investigation. OSHA enforces the whistleblower provisions of 22 statutes protecting employees who report violations of various securities laws, trucking, airline, nuclear power, pipeline, environmental, rail, public transportation, workplace safety and health, and consumer protection laws. Detailed information on employee whistleblower rights, including fact sheets and instructions on how to submit the form in hard-copy format, is available online at www.whistleblowers.gov .

"December 4, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20121204,Decision in miner discrimination case upheld by federal appeals court,"ARLINGTON, Va. – The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit has rejected an appeal by Cordero Mining LLC of Gillette, Wyo., in a worker discrimination case and affirmed a December 2011 decision by an administrative law judge of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission. In that decision, the judge ordered Cordero Mining to reinstate a discharged employee to her former position, make her whole for lost wages and benefits, remove from her personnel files references to the unlawful discharge and pay a civil penalty of $40,000. In May 2010, Cindy L. Clapp, a shovel operator with 28 years of experience as a miner, filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Commission alleging that Cordero terminated her employment in retaliation for her repeated safety complaints. Clapp claimed that her unlawful discharge had a chilling effect on the willingness of other miners to raise safety issues at the mine. MSHA sought a finding from the commission that Cordero unlawfully discriminated against an employee in violation of Section 105(c) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, which states that miners, miners' representatives and applicants for employment are protected from retaliation for engaging in safety and/or health-related activities, such as identifying hazards or asking for MSHA inspections. In December 2011, an administrative law judge of the commission concluded that Clapp had engaged in protected activities under the Mine Act, and Cordero had discharged her in retaliation for her activities. Cordero then filed an appeal with the commission, which declined to review the judge's decision. Cordero filed an appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit. In its decision, the appeals court found substantial evidence to support the administrative law judge's finding of discrimination and his decision to award full back pay. In addition, the court found that the $40,000 penalty was not excessive or an abuse of discretion. Cordero has until Dec. 31, 2012, to petition the court for a rehearing. ""This decision represents a resounding victory for miners and their right to identify hazardous conditions that imperil themselves and their fellow miners without fear of reprisal,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. During fiscal year 2012, MSHA filed 39 requests – more than in any other year – with the commission for temporary reinstatements on behalf of miners who submitted complaints of discrimination in the form of a suspension, layoff, discharge or other adverse action."

Fabre Laboy, doing business as Bananera Fabre, and his son, Jose V. Fabre Santiago, doing business as Finca La Plata, for failing to pay their workers the minimum wage as required by the Fair Labor Standards Act. The defendants cultivate and package bananas, tomatoes, and other fruits and vegetables for wholesale at contiguous locations on Rte. 117 in Sabana Grande. An investigation by the department's Wage and Hour Division found that the defendants willfully and repeatedly violated the law. The federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour, but the defendants paid many employees only $6.25 or $6.50 per hour. The division estimates that a total of $191,402 is owed to 174 employees between the two employers. ""These agricultural employers willfully and repeatedly violated the law, and they continue to withhold payments of unpaid wages due to their employees,"" said Jose R. Vazquez, the director of the division's district office in Guaynabo, which conducted the investigation. ""We will not tolerate these actions and, as demonstrated by the filing of this lawsuit, the Labor Department will use all enforcement tools available to recover workers' wages and hold accountable employers who demonstrate a clear disregard for the law."" The department's Regional Office of the Solicitor filed the suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico in San Juan. The suit asks the court to order the defendants to pay the full amount of back wages due plus an equal amount in liquidated damages to the affected workers. The suit also seeks to permanently prohibit the defendants from future violations of the FLSA. Fabre Laboy has been the subject of several Wage and Hour Division investigations in the past. As a result of the most recent prior inspection, Fabre Laboy paid $38,098 in back wages as well as $6,381 in civil money penalties. The FLSA requires that covered, nonexempt employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour as well as time and one-half their regular rates for every hour they work beyond 40 per week. The law also requires employers to maintain accurate records of employees' wages, hours and other conditions of employment, and prohibits employers from retaliating against employees who exercise their rights under the law.

Through their talents and skills, they are contributing to global economic growth and making the United States a stronger nation. ""More countries are coming to recognize the importance of giving all qualified job seekers equal opportunity to compete. However, in both good economic times and in bad, people with disabilities continue to have fewer opportunities in our educational institutions and workplaces than those without disabilities. This must change. We know that there's a strong business case for why companies should hire people with disabilities. These Americans want to work, and they're highly capable of success if proper accommodations are made. In fact, there's a growing body of evidence proving that workers with disabilities often meet or exceed the job performance of those without them. ""Here at home, we've made tremendous advances since the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act in combating discrimination against those who may have a disability. With this progress domestically comes a greater responsibility on the world stage to work with other nations so that they embrace policies to help the world's 1 billion persons with disabilities access good jobs, educational opportunities and critical medical care. ""Today, I join President Obama in calling on foreign nations to recognize the dignity and extraordinary talents of persons with disabilities everywhere.

"November 30, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20121130,FAA proposes policy to improve flight attendant workplace safety,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Aviation Administration, working with the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration, today proposed a new policy for addressing flight attendant workplace safety. While the FAA's aviation safety regulations take precedence, the agency is proposing that OSHA be able to enforce certain occupational safety and health standards currently not covered by FAA oversight. ""Safety is our highest priority and that certainly extends to those who work in the transportation industry,"" said Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood. ""Under this proposal, flight attendants would, for the first time, be able to report workplace injury and illness complaints to OSHA for response and investigation."" ""The policy announced today with the FAA will not only enhance the health and safety of flight attendants by connecting them directly with OSHA but will, by extension, improve the flying experience of millions of airline passengers,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. Flight attendant workplace issues could include things such as exposure to noise and bloodborne pathogens, and access to information on hazardous chemicals. The FAA and OSHA will continue to work to identify any additional conditions where OSHA requirements could apply. They will also develop procedures to ensure that OSHA does not apply any requirements that could affect aviation safety. ""Flight attendants contribute to the safe operation of every flight each day,"" said acting FAA Administrator Michael Huerta. ""This proposed policy is an important step toward establishing procedures for resolving flight attendant workplace health and safety concerns."" ""We look forward to working with the FAA and the airlines to assure the protection of flight attendants,"" said Dr. David Michaels, assistant secretary of labor for occupational safety and health. Through the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012, Congress required the FAA to develop a policy statement to outline the circumstances in which OSHA requirements could apply to crewmembers while they are working on aircraft. The policy notice was sent to the Federal Register today and is currently available at http://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/ashp/ . The 30-day comment period begins when the policy notice is published in the Federal Register."

"November 29, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20121129,MSHA announces results of October impact inspections,"ARLINGTON, Va. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration today announced that federal inspectors issued 210 citations and 14 orders during special impact inspections conducted at nine coal mines and five metal/nonmetal mines last month. The monthly inspections, which began in force in April 2010 following the explosion at the Upper Big Branch Mine, involve mines that merit increased agency attention and enforcement due to their poor compliance history or particular compliance concerns, including high numbers of violations or closure orders; frequent hazard complaints or hotline calls; plan compliance issues; inadequate workplace examinations; a high number of accidents, injuries or illnesses; fatalities; adverse conditions such as increased methane liberation, faulty roof conditions and inadequate ventilation; and respirable dust. As an example from last month, two separate impact inspections were conducted at Tunnel Ridge LLC's Tunnel Ridge Mine in Ohio County, W.Va., on Oct. 9 and Oct. 23. Inspectors issued 24 citations and two orders during these two impact inspections, the fourth and fifth for this operation. During the first inspection, enforcement personnel traveled all the conveyer belts and cited the operator six times for accumulations of combustible materials. Inspectors found fresh coal spillage up to 3 feet deep, loose coal and coal dust, and float coal dust along long distances of beltlines, around the belt structure and bottom rollers, and on the mine floor. Misaligned belts and belt conveyor flights, missing bottom rollers and damaged belt conveyor components also were found. One walkway within 2 feet of an energized belt was obstructed with loose rock, loose coal and sloughage, and the mine floor was irregular and slick. These conditions exposed miners to potential entanglement between the belt and the moving rollers; the accumulation of combustible materials increased the potential for a belt or mine fire. Additionally, the mine operator failed to record a number of hazardous conditions in its pre-shift/on-shift record book. In order to examine the mine when all mechanized mining units were up and running, inspectors returned two weeks later. During the second inspection, they focused on health compliance and issued seven citations and two orders. The mine operator was cited four times for failure to maintain the dust collection systems in permissible condition on four different roof bolting machines. Violations included clean side filters packed with drill dust, a damaged dust filter, loose gaskets on the dust box door and holes in the suction hose. The operator also failed to comply with the approved ventilation plan. While loading coal, the continuous mining machine produced no water and no water pressure when tested by the inspector. Failure to maintain the roof bolter dust collection system and comply with the approved parameters on the continuous mining machine allowed respirable dust to be exhausted into the mine atmosphere. These operating conditions increased the exposure of miners to respirable dust and developing black lung and other respiratory illnesses. The operator also was issued an unwarrantable failure order for coal accumulations of dry loose coal and coal dust in depths of 3- to 28 inches and approximate length of 585 feet in multiple entries. These conditions were not identified during the required pre-shift examinations. Consequently, this section of the mine was shut down for more than 25 hours. ""Workplace examinations are a vital part of keeping mines safe, and these inspections exposed alarming inadequacies in those exams,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""MSHA issued new health and safety rules in August requiring mine operators to conduct more thorough examinations to find and fix hazards to prevent this very situation. Mine operators cannot continue to put miners at risk by letting hazardous conditions languish until MSHA cites them."" As another example from last month, MSHA conducted an impact inspection on Oct. 23 and 24 at the Strata Corp., Portable Crushing Plant #1 in Grand Forks, N.D., and issued 19 citations and three orders. Inspectors cited the mine operator for allowing various items to accumulate in the walkway, creating a slipping or tripping hazard for workers attempting to access supplies kept in the parts trailer and storage shed. An unwarrantable failure citation was issued for failure to provide a safe means of access to the plant's main fuel storage tank. The ladder in place would not reach the top of the tank, creating the potential for an 11-foot fall. On three previous occasions, the operator had been cited for this violation. Inspectors found a skid loader machine running over 480-volt power cables, creating an electrical shock hazard. Since no effort was made by the mine operator to abate this condition, the inspector issued a closure order until berms were built to restrict access to the cables. An unwarrantable failure order was issued for the operator's failure to conduct workplace examinations since Oct. 20. Other existing hazards included a grinder and sanding machine without a guard, missing cover plates over electrical outlets, inadequately splicing a 480-volt power cable, not guarding the drive pulley on a portable air compressor, not properly securing a compressed gas cylinder and not maintaining proper task training records. An order requiring the withdrawal of three miners was issued because they had not received the proper task training. Last July, a 49-year-old equipment operator with 18 weeks of mining experience was killed at this operation. He was standing on the discharge end of a 150-foot stacker belt conveyor, greasing the head pulley, when a co-worker started the conveyor. The victim fell off the conveyor approximately 50 feet to the ground below. Since April 2010, MSHA has conducted 523 impact inspections and issued 9,160 citations, 889 orders and 38 safeguards.

"November 29, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20121129,Statement by Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis on tragic fire in Bangladesh,"WASHINGTON Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis today issued the following statement regarding the tragic fire in Bangladesh: ""This past Saturday, Bangladesh suffered one of the worst industrial accidents in its history. A devastating fire swept through the Tazreen Fashion garment factory, killing more than 100 and injuring many more. I join U.S. Ambassador to Bangladesh Dan Mozena in extending heartfelt condolences to the people of Bangladesh and the many families who lost their loved ones. ""Just over a century ago, in March 1911, the Triangle Shirtwaist factory in New York City burned to the ground, killing 146 people, mainly young women. That fire was our call to action. It galvanized support for stronger worker protections and institutions to enforce them, from workplace health and safety to workers' right to organize and bargain collectively. ""The Tazreen Fashion factory fire is a similar call to action for Bangladesh and also for the many international buyers supplied by the country's garment factories. Investigations should be conducted and the perpetrators punished, but things cannot then return to business as usual. I know that change is not easy. The U.S. Department of Labor stands ready to help, with technical assistance and expertise, to work with the government of Bangladesh to ensure that this horrific tragedy becomes a watershed moment for Bangladeshi workers' rights."""
"November 29, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20121129,"US Labor Department sues Dallas-based The Christmas Light Co. to secure more than $240,000 in minimum and overtime back wages","DALLAS — The U.S. Department of Labor has filed a lawsuit against The Christmas Light Co. Inc. and owner William F. Rathburn to recover approximately $240,881 in wages and an additional amount in liquidated damages on behalf of 233 employers who installed and removed lights for the company. An investigation in Dallas by the department's Wage and Hour Division found that the company violated the Fair Labor Standards Act by failing to pay 233 installers and removers the minimum and overtime wages required by law. ""The Labor Department holds employers accountable when they do not properly pay their workers,"" said Cynthia Watson, regional administrator for the Wage and Hour Division in the Southwest. ""Failing to pay minimum and overtime wages is unacceptable. Such behavior robs workers of their rightful wages and undercuts those hardworking and conscientious employers who obey the law. This lawsuit demonstrates that the department will use all enforcement tools available, including litigation, to recover workers' wages and ensure a level playing field for law-abiding employers."" The complaint was filed in the Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division seeking back wages, liquidated damages and an injunction against future violations of the FLSA, which provides that employers who violate the law are, as a general rule, liable to employees for their back wages and an equal amount in liquidated damages. Liquidated damages are paid directly to the affected employees. The investigation determined that the company paid employees a flat rate for installing and removing Christmas lights without regard to the number of hours the employees had worked. Investigators also found that in most cases employees were paid ""straight time"" rather than overtime at time and one-half their regular rates for hours worked over 40 in a week, as required. Additionally, records required by the FLSA were not maintained. The FLSA requires that covered, nonexempt employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour for all hours worked. An overtime premium rate takes into account commissions, bonuses and incentive pay. Additionally, employers must maintain accurate time and payroll records.

"November 29, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20121129,US Labor Department sues to recover losses to employee stock ownership plan of Maran Inc.,"NEW YORK ‒ The U.S. Department of Labor has filed a lawsuit to recover losses suffered by participants in the Maran Inc. Employee Stock Ownership Plan after the plan was allowed to purchase overvalued company stock. The suit names as a defendant First Bankers Trust Services Inc., which was hired as an independent fiduciary and trustee in connection with the company’s ESOP to determine whether, and at what price, to purchase shares of Maran Inc. from majority shareholders. The ESOP is also a defendant. The suit alleges that First Bankers Trust Services violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act when, in late 2006, it approved the ESOP’s purchase of 49 percent of the outstanding stock of Maran Inc. for approximately $71 million, which was more than fair market value. As a result, ESOP participants suffered significant losses. “ESOP participants depend on the plan to buy and sell sponsor-company stock at fair market value,” said Jonathan Kay, regional director of the Labor Department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration’s New York Regional Office. “The department is committed to making sure that the ones responsible for making these decisions are fulfilling their fiduciary duties to protect the interests of the ESOP participants.” The suit seeks to recover all losses and have First Bankers Trust Services enjoined from serving as a fiduciary to ESOP plans. Maran Inc. is an apparel company headquartered in Manhattan. The suit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and is being litigated by the Plan Benefits Security Division of the department’s Office of the Solicitor in Washington, D.C. The suit is based on an investigation conducted by EBSA’s New York Regional Office. Employers and workers can reach EBSA’s New York office at 212-607-8600 or toll-free at 866-444-3272 for help with problems related to private sector retirement and health plans.

"November 28, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20121128,"US Labor Departments OSHA cites Dover Chemical Co. for 47 violations following chemical release at Ohio plant, proposes $545,000 in fines","Company also placed in OSHAs Severe Violator Enforcement Program DOVER, Ohio – The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration has cited Dover Chemical Co. for 47 health and safety including four willful violations after an unexpected release of hazardous materials led to the temporary shutdown of the company's Dover plant and an adjacent highway in May. Although no injuries were reported as a result of the incident, OSHA opened an investigation focused on the agency's standards for process safety management, known as PSM, at facilities that use highly hazardous chemicals. Proposed fines total $545,000. The release of materials resulted from a breach of a polyvinyl chloride piping system. Due to the nature of the hazards and the willful violations cited, Dover Chemical has been placed in OSHA's Severe Violator Enforcement Program, which mandates targeted follow-up inspections to ensure compliance with the law. ""By disregarding OSHA's common-sense regulations, this employer endangered the health and safety of the facility's workers,"" said Dr. David Michaels, assistant secretary of labor for occupational safety and health. ""While I'm grateful that nobody was injured from the incident, I'm alarmed by the egregious nature of the violations we uncovered during our inspection."" The willful violations all relate to PSM, and include failing to correct deficiencies found in compliance audits, not resolving recommendations identified during a process hazard analysis, having operating procedures that do not include the consequences for deviation or the steps required to correct or avoid deviation from operating limits, and process safety information that does not detail the construction materials used for piping and piping system components. A willful violation is one committed with intentional knowing or voluntary disregard for the law's requirements, or with plain indifference to worker safety and health. Thirty serious violations also relate to PSM, such as inaccurate operating procedures; inadequate information about the hazardous effects of inadvertently mixing different chemicals, safe upper and lower limits for operating parameters, and the lack of chemical reactivity data; and failing to include system design codes and standards. The company also did not train employees about PSM, document that equipment complies with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices, perform inspections and tests on process equipment, and correct deficiencies noted during equipment inspections. An additional 11 serious violations involve unguarded wall and floor openings, failing to test aerial lift controls prior to use, allowing untrained individuals to operate lifts, not developing energy control procedures for the maintenance and servicing of equipment, and electrical hazards. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known. Two other-than-serious violations are not certifying personal protective equipment hazard assessments and not certifying whether powered industrial vehicle training was conducted. An other-than-serious violation is one that has a direct relationship to job safety and health, but probably would not cause death or serious physical harm. The Dover facility employs about 175 workers and produces chlorinated paraffins; additives for flame-resistant products; and other additives for the plastic, rubber coating, adhesive and textile product industries. The facility has been inspected by OSHA four other times since 2007, resulting in earlier citations for four violations. A subsidiary of New York-based ICC Industries Inc., Dover Chemical Co. also operates a facility in Hammond, Ind., that uses similar procedures and employs 86 workers. OSHA's Severe Violator Enforcement Program focuses on recalcitrant employers that endanger workers by committing willful, repeat or failure-to-abate violations. Under the program, OSHA may inspect any of the employer's facilities. For more information, visit http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=DIRECTIVES&p_id=4503 .

"November 28, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20121128,MSHA issues potential pattern of violations letters to 4 mines,"ARLINGTON, Va. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration today announced that four mining operations have received letters putting them on notice about a potential pattern of violations of mandatory health or safety standards under Section 104(e) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. The PPOV screening from which these letters resulted represents the third since MSHA established the current criteria and procedures in September 2010. The four mines that received warning letters are Ten-Mile Coal Co. Inc.'s No. 4 Mine in Harrison County, W.Va.; Pike Floyd Mining Inc.'s No. 3 Mine in Pike County, Ky.; Argus Energy WV LLC's Deep Mine No. 8 in Wayne County, W.Va.; and Noranda Alumina LLC's Gramercy Facility in St. James County, La. In addition, two nonproducing mines have received warning letters that they will be subject to PPOV procedures once they return to active status. They are D & C Mining Corp.'s D & C Mining Corp. in Harlan County, Ky., and Hecla Mining Co.'s Lucky Friday Mine in Shoshone County, Idaho. Fourteen other mines are under PPOV consideration while MSHA is verifying injury information self-reported by the operators to ensure accuracy. MSHA implemented improved screening criteria in 2010 to better identify mines that have been subject to closure orders, including for serious issues such as failing to correct violations cited by MSHA, unwarrantable failures to comply with health or safety standards, failure to provide miners with required training and imminent dangers in the mine. The criteria better identify mines where these tools have been used but have not been sufficient to improve compliance. The criteria also consider whether a mine has a high number of significant and substantial, or S&S, violations involving elevated negligence as well as a mine's injury severity rate, targeting operations that have an above-average injury severity measure. As a result of the first screening under the improved criteria conducted in October 2010, MSHA issued 17 PPOV notices and one postponement letter to Massey Energy's Upper Big Branch Mine. As a result of an October 2011 screening, MSHA issued eight PPOV notices and three postponement letters at mines that were in nonproducing status, inactive or abandoned. ""The revised potential pattern of violations program, along with other enforcement actions such as impact inspections, is making mines safer,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""The number of chronic violators meeting improved screening criteria has substantially dropped since we began implementing these criteria in 2010."" The Mine Act provides for enhanced enforcement at mines that exhibit a pattern of violations of significant and substantial health or safety violations. MSHA regulations provide that the agency screens for PPOV mines at least once a year. Mines that receive PPOV notices have the opportunity to implement corrective action programs, and they must reduce their S&S rates to targets set by the agency. Mine operators that do not meet these targets are subject to receiving a notice for a pattern of violations and closure orders for all S&S violations under Section 104(e). MSHA encourages mine operators to implement corrective action programs with long-term goals for reducing violations beyond the goals established by MSHA under the POV procedures. Following the October 2010 screening, MSHA issued PPOV notices at four additional mines after audits of 39 operations revealed inaccurately reported injury data. During the October 2011 screening, MSHA found that 28 additional mines were subject to agency injury audits, with none receiving PPOV notices. The number of mines meeting the criteria to trigger an audit has fallen substantially, as well. MSHA has developed an online PPOV monitoring tool that allows operators, miners and others to determine, based on the most recent compliance data available, how a specific mine matches up with the initial screening criteria for a potential pattern of violations. The initial screening criteria are based on enforcement data that are refreshed monthly. In April 2011, Bledsoe Coal Corp.'s Abner Branch Rider Mine in Leslie County, Ky., and The New West Virginia Mining Co.'s Apache Mine in McDowell County, W.Va., became the first mines in the history of the Mine Act to be subject to the full effect of POV enforcement action and thus subject to 104(e) closure orders."
"November 28, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20121128,"US Labor Department sues Boston Hides & Furs Ltd., seeking at least $1 million in back wages and damages for underpaid, wrongfully fired workers","Chelsea, Mass., business also assessed $100,000 penalty for willful labor violations BOSTON — Citing ""knowing, deliberate and intentional"" violations of federal wage and hour law, the U.S. Department of Labor has filed a lawsuit against Boston Hides & Furs Ltd. and company officials seeking at least $500,000 in back wages and an equal amount in liquidated damages for underpaid employees of the Chelsea wholesale animal hide business. The department filed the lawsuit in federal court following an investigation by its Wage and Hour Division that found the employer committed willful and repeated violations of the minimum wage, overtime and record-keeping provisions of the federal Fair Labor Standards Act, including offering for shipment or sale ""hot goods"" produced in violation of the law during a period spanning at least three years. The suit also asserts that the company unlawfully retaliated against several workers by firing them after they cooperated with the federal investigation. ""The violations uncovered by this investigation reveal a disturbing disregard for the law,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""Such unacceptable behavior not only harms the workers involved, it also undercuts employers who obey the law."" The investigation found that 14 Boston Hides & Furs employees worked approximately 10 hours per day, six days per week processing hides and furs for shipping to tanneries. These workers were paid a daily cash wage of $50 to $70, which amounted to an hourly pay rate far below the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. The employees also were not paid time and one-half the required state minimum wage of $8 applicable for those hours worked above 40 in a week. Additionally, the defendants failed to keep adequate records of the workers' employment, work hours and pay rates, and a representative of the defendants falsely told investigators that the company's payroll records included all employees. Further, the defendants ordered employees to hide in a nearby house when Wage and Hour Division investigators first arrived at Boston Hides & Furs so they could not be interviewed. Investigators subsequently interviewed the workers. Two days later, the defendants fired the workers. During their employment, the workers were threatened and subjected to verbally abusive treatment on an ongoing basis, particularly when they asked about their pay rates. ""If you work, you are entitled to be paid the wages you earn — at a rate no less than the applicable minimum wage, with proper overtime pay — and to seek those wages without fear of retaliation or termination. It's that simple and it's the law,"" said Michael Felsen, the Labor Department's regional solicitor for New England. ""If you're an employer, understand that if you cheat your workers on their pay, the U.S. Department of Labor will seek not only the withheld wages but an equal amount in liquidated damages for those workers. And if you fire your workers or otherwise retaliate against them because they cooperated with a Labor Department investigation, we will seek appropriate redress for that violation too."" In addition to back wages and liquidated damages, the department's suit seeks to permanently prohibit the defendants from future FLSA violations — including a prohibition against shipping any goods handled by workers who were paid in violation of the law — and compensatory and punitive damages for the workers on account of their unlawful firing. The Wage and Hour Division also has assessed $100,000 in civil money penalties against Boston Hides & Furs Ltd. for willful violations of the FLSA. The suit has been filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts by the Labor Department's Regional Office of the Solicitor in Boston. The original investigation was conducted by the Wage and Hour Division's Boston District Office. The FLSA requires that covered employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour as well as time and one-half their regular rates for every hour they work beyond 40 per week. When the state minimum wage is higher than the federally mandated wage, and employees work more than 40 hours in a week, employees paid at the minimum permissible level are entitled to overtime compensation based on the higher state minimum wage. The law also requires employers to maintain accurate records of employees' wages, hours and other conditions of employment, and prohibits employers from retaliating against employees who exercise their rights under the law. The FLSA provides that employers who violate the law are, as a general rule, liable to employees for back wages and an equal amount in liquidated damages.

Allegations: In March 2009, the Secretary of Labor filed a lawsuit against multiple defendants, including Community Trust Company, formerly of Camp Hill, Pa., alleging violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The allegations were due to the defendants’ involvement with more than 100 prototype welfare plans known as the Regional Employers Assurance Leagues Voluntary Employees’ Beneficiary Association Trust, and later as the Single Employer Welfare Benefit Plan and Trust. Farmers & Merchants Trust Co. of Chambersburg, successor by merger to CTC, served as the trustee of these welfare benefit plans until January 2010. With regard to this defendant, the Secretary’s complaint alleged that CTC breached its ERISA fiduciary duties as the directed trustee of the plans when it followed directions from the plans’ administrator, co-defendant Penn-Mont Benefit Services Inc., to transfer interest income out of the plans’ trust account on a monthly basis from April 2002 to December 2004 to one of the co-defendants, Penn Public Trust. According to the Secretary’s allegations, those directions were not properly made in accordance with the terms of the plan documents and were contrary to ERISA. Resolution: On Nov. 27, 2012, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania approved and entered a consent judgment agreed to by F & M Trust and the Secretary resolving all the claims against CTC in the Secretary’s complaint. Pursuant to the consent judgment, F & M Trust will pay $175,000 in settlement of the ERISA claims alleged by the Secretary against CTC, and a $17,500 penalty. Additionally, F & M Trust will relinquish $300,000 in funds it withheld following the issuance of the District Court’s Jan. 14, 2010, order which, among other things, discharged F & M Trust as trustee of the plans. F & M Trust will also pay the aforementioned funds into the Registry of the Court, where they shall remain until further order of the court. The Secretary will continue to litigate ERISA claims against the remaining defendants, which include John J. Koresko, V, Jeanne Bonney, Penn-Mont Benefit Service Inc., the Koresko Law Firm, P.C., Koresko and Associates, P.C., and Penn Public Trust. Among other relief, the Secretary seeks restitution to the plans from these remaining defendants, removal of these defendants as plan fiduciaries and services providers and the appointment of new fiduciaries for the plans, and a full accounting of the plans’ finances and assets.

The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration has cited Associated Spring-Barnes Group Inc. for 30 alleged serious violations of workplace safety standards at the company's Bristol metal stamping plant. The company faces a total of $139,000 in proposed fines for electrical, mechanical, exit access, fall and combustible dust hazards identified during an inspection by OSHA's Hartford Area Office. ""The sizable fines proposed in this case reflect the breadth and seriousness of the hazards identified at this work site,"" said Warren Simpson, OSHA's area director in Hartford. ""Left uncorrected, they expose the plant's employees to burns, falls, electric shocks, lacerations, amputations, hearing loss, fires and explosions, and being unable to exit the workplace safely in the event of an emergency. For the safety of its workers, this employer must take effective and expeditious action to eliminate these conditions and prevent their recurrence."" Specifically, OSHA found that combustible dust was allowed to accumulate, two of the plant's dust collection systems lacked controls to prevent or suppress fires and explosions, and three emergency exit routes led through areas where the dust collection systems would vent if a fire occurred. Inspectors also found a variety of machine guarding, electrical and fall hazards; damaged protective gloves; and an improperly stored container of combustible liquid. Finally, the employer did not provide an emergency eyewash, refitted hearing protection for employees who sustained a standard threshold shift in their hearing and a fire extinguisher in an area where combustible aluminum is cut. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known.

Under the agreement, Winrock International will partner with local rubber-producing companies Liberian Co./LIBCO and Morris-American Rubber Co.; the General Agriculture and Allied Workers Union of Liberia; and nongovernmental organizations Forum for African Women Educationalists, and African Network for Prevention and Protection Against Child Labor. The project is designed to support the direct delivery of services to children engaged in or at risk of child labor. It will assist households in Liberian communities where families are largely dependent on smallholder rubber plantations by providing education, livelihood and youth employment services. In addition, the project will promote improved policies to address child labor on company plantations, and enhance the monitoring and enforcement of these policies. Finally, the project will help vulnerable children and their families to access existing social protection programs such as school feeding and direct cash transfer programs that are supported by the government of Liberia.

An investigation by the department's Wage and Hour Division found that the San Francisco-based bank wrongly classified the employees as exempt from overtime, resulting in violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act's overtime and record-keeping provisions. Investigators found that First Republic Bank failed to consider the FLSA's criteria that allow certain administrative and professional employees to be exempt from receiving overtime pay. In fact, the employees were entitled to overtime compensation at one and one-half times their regular rates for hours worked over 40 in a week. Additionally, the bank failed to include bonus payments in nonexempt employees' regular rates of pay when computing overtime compensation, in violation of the act. Record-keeping violations resulted from the employer's failure to record the number of hours worked by the misclassified employees. ""It is essential that employers take the time to carefully assess the FLSA classification of their workforce,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""As this investigation demonstrates, improper classification results in improper wages and causes workers real economic harm."" First Republic Bank is a full-service bank and wealth management company with approximately 1,700 employees in the five states. The bank has paid the back wages in full. The FLSA provides an exemption from both minimum wage and overtime pay requirements for individuals employed in bona fide executive, administrative, professional and outside sales positions, as well as certain computer employees. To qualify for exemption, employees generally must meet certain tests regarding their job duties and be paid on a salary basis at not less than $455 per week. Job titles do not determine exempt status. In order for an exemption to apply, an employee's specific job duties and salary must meet all the requirements of the department's regulations. The FLSA requires that covered, nonexempt employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 for all hours worked, plus time and one-half their regular rates, including commissions, bonuses and incentive pay, for hours worked beyond 40 per week.

"November 26, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20121126-2,"Dalton, Ga., chemical manufacturer cited by US Department of Labors OSHA for 20 safety violations following explosion; proposed penalties total $77,000","DALTON, Ga. – MFG Chemical Inc. in Dalton has been cited by the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration for 20 safety violations following a plant explosion that resulted in the hospitalization of approximately 40 employees for decontamination. Proposed penalties total $77,000. The May explosion was caused by a runaway reaction from an overheated reactor. During the production of coagulant 129, a compound used in water treatment, an increase in temperature caused the reactor to overpressurize, rupturing the dome cover and blowing a hole in the roof of the facility. In response to the incident, OSHA conducted an inspection under the agency's national emphasis program on process safety management for covered chemical facilities. Nineteen serious violations involve exposing workers to fire and explosion hazards while they performed manufacturing duties, as well as failing to ensure that initial process hazard analyses were conducted; develop operational procedures that are safe, accurate and concise, and which include operating parameters such as emergency shutdown; provide training and implement safe work practices for contracted workers performing maintenance in a PSM-covered area; develop and implement a written mechanical integrity program for workers required to perform maintenance on and repair process equipment; develop emergency response procedures that include handling small chemical releases; identify permit-required confined spaces such as reactors, receivers and mixers, among others; ensure confined space permits were issued and documented prior to allowing workers to enter the spaces; ensure that eyewash/shower facilities were available and accessible for workers exposed to chemical burns; mount and identify the placement of portable fire extinguishers; and establish a preferred way of communicating an emergency evacuation. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known. The citations carry $76,300 in penalties. One other-than-serious violation is failing to ensure that a material safety data worksheet contained the required information. An other-than-serious violation is one that has a direct relationship to job safety and health, but probably would not cause death or serious physical harm. The citation carries a $700 penalty. ""This inspection has identified a wide range of safety hazards that need to be addressed in order to protect workers,"" said Andre Richards, director of OSHA's Atlanta-West Area Office. ""It is the employer's responsibility to provide a safe and healthful workplace."" MFG Chemical manufactures a range of specialty chemicals for the water treatment, agriculture, pulp and paper industries.

The fatalities led to comprehensive inspections by OSHA. On May 22, an operator attempting to start up a steam turbine in sulfuric acid plant No. 2 was struck by flying metal debris when the turbine housing ruptured due to apparent overpressurization. In a similar incident on June 1, an operator restarting a tripped steam turbine in sulfuric acid plant No. 3 also was killed by flying metal debris when the turbine housing ruptured due to overpressurization. OSHA has cited the company for three serious safety violations related to the fatalities, including exposing workers to ""struck-by"" hazards by not protecting them against overpressurization, and failing to maintain and service equipment in accordance with the company's maintenance program to prevent overpressurization. An additional 23 serious safety violations involve failing to test and inspect pressure relief devices throughout the facility, provide handrails on fixed stairways, guard floor holes that could cause workers to trip and fall, provide fixed stairs to access tank gauging, address engineering controls during a process hazard analysis, and guard belt roller nip points, horizontal shafts, rotating shafts and horizontal V-belts. The violations also include various electrical hazards such as exposing workers to shocks, missing panel knockouts, broken face plates, unguarded light bulbs and an open ground in an outlet circuit. Ten serious health violations involve failing to conduct an initial process hazard analysis, update the process hazard analysis every five years, conduct compliance audits for process safety management and determine the presence of asbestos prior to working on equipment, as well as to label hazardous substances such as caustic soda, acid and petroleum products that are used throughout the facility. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known. One repeat health violation has been cited for a lack of housekeeping. A repeat violation exists when an employer previously has been cited for the same or a similar violation of a standard, regulation, rule or order at any facility in federal enforcement states within the last five years. A similar violation was cited in May 2009. Three other-than-serious safety violations are failing to mount a fire extinguisher so it is readily available, not labeling circuit breakers, and using flexible cords and equipment cables that do not have strain relief. An other-than-serious violation is one that has a direct relationship to job safety and health, but probably would not cause death or serious physical harm. ""Employers need to be proactive to ensure that all operating equipment is properly maintained and functional,"" said Clyde Payne, director of OSHA's Jackson Area Office. ""Had this employer done so, these tragic events could have been prevented."" Mississippi Phosphates is a producer and marketer of diammonium phosphate, which is used as a fertilizer. The company's manufacturing facilities consist of two sulfuric acid plants, a phosphoric acid plant and diammonium phosphate granulation plant.

The department is seeking $227,366 in back wages plus an equal amount in liquidated damages for 70 employees. The suit is based on an investigation by the department's Wage and Hour Division, which found that the employer failed to pay employees at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour as well as provide overtime compensation at time and one-half employees' regular rates for hours worked beyond 40 in a week.

RJ Concrete is a contractor engaged in the construction of residential basements. An investigation conducted by the division's Raleigh District Office found that the employer paid the employees a ""day rate,"" compensating them at a fixed amount per day without accounting for the overtime premium due for hours worked beyond 40 in a week. Additionally, the employer failed to keep accurate records of hours worked and wages paid. For example, rather than recording the number of hours worked by each employee, records reflect only a check mark for each day an employee worked. ""Employers are legally obligated to maintain accurate records and to pay employees for all hours worked, including proper overtime compensation when hours exceed 40 in a week,"" said Richard Blaylock, director of the Wage and Hour Division's Raleigh office. ""The back wages paid in this case should serve as notice to all employers that they must be in compliance with the law."" In addition to paying the back wages, the employer has agreed to comply with the FLSA in the future. The FLSA requires that covered employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 for all hours worked, plus time and one-half their regular rates, including commissions, bonuses and incentive pay, for hours worked beyond 40 per week. In general, ""hours worked"" includes all time an employee must be on duty, or on the employer's premises or at any other prescribed place of work, from the beginning of the first principal work activity to the end of the last principal activity of the workday.

The department has a smart phone application to help employees independently track the hours they work and determine the wages they are owed.

Investigators found that employees were paid fixed salaries without regard to the number of hours worked. This practice resulted in the employees' regular rates of pay (defined as their salaries divided by the total weekly hours worked) falling below the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. The employer also failed to pay overtime compensation at time and one-half the employees' regular rates for hours over 40 in a workweek, as required. Additionally, the restaurant employed a 14-year-old who was allowed to work beyond the hours permitted by the FLSA's Child Labor Regulation No. 3, which limits the total hours and times of day that 14- and 15-year-old employees may work. Finally, the employer failed to keep accurate records of hours worked, wages paid and proof of dates of birth for workers under 18. ""The Wage and Hour Division is committed to protecting low-wage employees in the restaurant industry, where we have found widespread FLSA violations. Employers must not profit by exploiting some of our most vulnerable workers,"" said Richard Blaylock, director of the Wage and Hour Division's Raleigh District Office. ""This case should serve as notice to other employers who may not be paying their employees in accordance with federal law."" The FLSA requires that covered, nonexempt employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour for all hours worked, plus time and one-half their regular rates, including commissions, bonuses and incentive pay, for hours worked beyond 40 per week. Simply paying employees a salary does not exempt them from minimum wage and overtime protections. In general, ""hours worked"" includes all time an employee must be on duty, or on the employer's premises or at any other prescribed place of work, from the beginning of the first principal work activity to the end of the last principal activity of the workday. Additionally, the law requires that accurate records of employees' wages, hours and other conditions of employment be maintained. The FLSA's child labor provisions protect young workers by limiting the types of jobs and the number of hours they may work. Children under 14 may not be employed in nonagricultural occupations covered by the FLSA. Fourteen- and 15-year-olds may be employed outside of school hours in a variety of nonmanufacturing and nonhazardous jobs for limited periods of time and under specified conditions.

Under the rule, insurance companies would be allowed to vary premiums within limits, only based on age, tobacco use, family size and geography. Health insurance companies would be prohibited from denying coverage to any American because of a pre-existing condition or from charging higher premiums to certain enrollees because of their current or past health problems, gender, occupation, and small employer size or industry. The rule would ensure that people for whom coverage would otherwise be unaffordable and young adults have access to a catastrophic coverage plan in the individual market.

"November 20, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20121120-0,US Department of Labor issues compliance guidance for employee benefit plans in wake of Hurricane Sandy,"WASHINGTON – The Assistant Secretary of Labor for Employee Benefits Security, Phyllis C. Borzi, today provided the following information about compliance with employee benefit plan rules for those adversely impacted by Hurricane Sandy: The U.S. Department of Labor understands that, as the practical and personal implications of the Hurricane Sandy natural disaster unfolds, plan fiduciaries, employers, labor organizations, service providers, as well as participants and beneficiaries, may encounter compliance-related issues over the next few months in connection with employee benefit plans covered by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). The guidance provided in this statement applies to employee benefit plans, plan sponsors, as well as service providers to such employers, located on October 26, 2012 in one of the counties or Tribal Nations that have been identified as covered disaster areas because of the devastation caused by Hurricane Sandy. Covered disaster areas are identified as federally declared disaster areas in the News Releases issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for Victims of Hurricane Sandy, which are found on IRS.gov at: www.irs.gov/uac/Newsroom/Help-for-Victims-of-Hurricane-Sandy. The relief provided under this announcement is in addition to the Form 5500 Annual Return/Report filing relief already provided by the IRS pursuant to News Release IR-2012-83 under § 7508A of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) for victims of Hurricane Sandy. (See the regulations under § 7508A and Section 8 of Rev. Proc. 2007-56, 2007-34 I.R.B. 388.) Verification Procedures for Plan Loans and Distributions The IRS, in IRS Announcement 2012-44, provided relief from certain verification procedures that may be required under retirement plans with respect to plan loans to participants and beneficiaries, hardship distributions, and other pension benefit distributions. The Department will not treat any person as having violated the provisions of title I of ERISA solely because they complied with the provisions of the IRS Announcement. Participant Contributions and Loan Repayments In accordance with 29 CFR § 2510.3-102, amounts that a participant or beneficiary pays to an employer or amounts that a participant has withheld from his or her wages by an employer for contribution or repayment of a participant loan to an employee pension benefit plan constitute plan assets, and thereby are required to be forwarded to the plan, on the earliest date on which such amounts can reasonably be segregated from the employer’s general assets, but in no event later than the 15th business day of the month following the month in which the amounts were paid to or withheld by the employer. The Department recognizes that some employers and service providers acting on employers’ behalf, such as payroll processing services, located in designated affected areas will not be able to forward participant payments and withholdings to employee pension benefit plans within the prescribed timeframe. In such instances, the Department will not, solely on the basis of a failure attributable to Hurricane Sandy, seek to enforce the provisions of title I with respect to a temporary delay in the forwarding of such payments or contributions to an employee pension benefit plan to the extent that affected employers, and service providers, act reasonably, prudently and in the interest of employees to comply as soon as practicable under the circumstances. The IRS has informed the Department that, subject to the foregoing conditions, it will not seek to assess an excise tax with respect to a prohibited transaction under section 4975 of the Code resulting solely from such a temporary delay. Blackout Notices In general, section 101(i) of ERISA and the regulations issued thereunder, at 29 CFR § 2520.101-3, provide that the administrator of an individual account plan is required to provide 30 days advance notice to participants and beneficiaries whose rights under the plan will be temporarily suspended, limited, or restricted by a blackout period (i.e., a period of suspension, limitation or restriction of more than three consecutive business days on a participant’s ability to direct investments, obtain loans, or obtain other distributions from the plan). The regulations provide an exception to the advance notice requirement when the inability to provide the advance notice is due to events beyond the reasonable control of the plan administrator and a fiduciary so determines in writing. Natural disasters, by definition, are beyond the control of a plan administrator. With respect to blackout periods related to Hurricane Sandy, the Department will not allege a violation of the blackout notice requirements solely on the basis that a fiduciary did not make the required written determination. ERISA Group Health Plan Compliance Guidance The Department recognizes that plan participants and beneficiaries may encounter an array of problems due to the Hurricane, such as difficulties meeting certain deadlines for filing benefit claims and COBRA elections. The guiding principle for plans must be to act reasonably, prudently, and in the interest of the workers and their families, who rely on their health plans for their physical and economic well-being. Plan fiduciaries should make reasonable accommodations to prevent the loss of benefits in such cases and should take steps to minimize the possibility of individuals losing benefits because of a failure to comply with pre-established timeframes. Moreover, the Department acknowledges that there may be instances when full and timely compliance by group health plans and issuers may not be possible. As stated previously, see www.dol.gov/ebsa/faqs/faq-aca.html, our approach to enforcement continues to be marked by an emphasis on compliance assistance and includes grace periods and other relief, where appropriate, including when physical disruption to a plan or service provider’s principal place of business by the Hurricane makes compliance with pre-established timeframes for certain claims decisions or disclosures impossible. Contact Information The Labor Department and IRS will continue to monitor the situation to address those issues that are most important in helping individuals, employers, and plan sponsors recover from this tragedy. Further guidance will be forthcoming.

Schneiderman's Office today signed memoranda of understanding to protect the rights of employees by preventing their misclassification as independent contractors or other nonemployee statuses. The memoranda of understanding represent a new effort on the part of the three agencies to work together to protect the rights of employees and level the playing field for responsible employers by reducing the practice of misclassification. The New York State Labor Department and New York State Attorney General's Office are the latest state agencies to partner with the Labor Department. In the last two years, the Wage Hour Division has secured over $18.2 million in back wages for more than 19,000 workers where the primary reason for minimum wage or overtime violations under the Fair Labor Standards Act was that workers were not treated or classified as employees. This represents a 97 percent increase in back wages following the implementation of these agreements. ""Working with the states is an important tool in ending misclassification,"" said M. Patricia Smith, U.S. Solicitor of Labor. ""These collaborations allow us to better coordinate and ensure compliance with both federal and state laws alike."" ""Misclassification deprives workers of rightfully-earned wages and undercuts law-abiding businesses,"" said Laura Fortman, the principal deputy administrator of the Wage and Hour Division. ""These memoranda of understanding send a clear message that we are standing together with the State of New York to protect workers and responsible employers and ensure everyone has the opportunity to succeed."" ""When employers misclassify employees as independent contractors for their own gain, they hurt their employees and they even hurt other businesses — the law-abiding employers who don't steal from their employees,"" said New York State Labor Commissioner Peter Rivera. ""I'm proud of this partnership we're beginning here today to root out bad actors and bring them to justice."" ""This partnership with the U.S. Department of Labor will help New York continue our work of aggressively enforcing the labor laws and ensuring a level playing field for employers who play by the rules. Sharing information and cooperating in investigations will help protect the rights of New York's workforce, and will lead to more effective enforcement and greater compliance by employers,"" said Terri Gerstein, Labor Bureau Chief for New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman. The New York State Attorney General's office brings select cases to enforce the state's labor laws, including both civil and criminal cases. For more information, please visit the Labor Bureau's website at: http://www.ag.ny.gov/bureau/labor-bureau/ (link is external) . Business models that attempt to change or obscure the employment relationship through the use of independent contractors are not inherently illegal, but they may not be used to evade compliance with federal labor law. Although legitimate independent contractors are an important part of our economy, the misclassification of employees presents a serious problem, as these employees often are denied access to critical benefits and protections–such as family and medical leave, overtime compensation, minimum wage pay and Unemployment Insurance–to which they are entitled. In addition, misclassification can create economic pressure for law-abiding business owners, who often find it difficult to compete with those who are skirting the law. Memoranda of understanding with state government agencies arose as part of the department's Misclassification Initiative, with the goal of preventing, detecting and remedying employee misclassification. California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Utah and Washington have signed similar agreements.

In 2008, a worker was trampled to death while a mob of shoppers rushed through the doors of a large store to take advantage of an after-Thanksgiving Day Black Friday sales event. OSHA recommends that retailers follow certain safeguards against this type of tragedy. ""Crowd control and proper planning are critical to preventing injuries and deaths,"" said Dr. David Michaels, assistant secretary of labor for occupational safety and health. ""OSHA urges retailers to adopt a crowd management plan during the holiday shopping season that includes a few simple guidelines."" Crowd management plans should include: On-site trained security personnel or police officers. Barricades or rope lines for pedestrians that do not start right in front of the store s entrance. Implementing crowd control measures well in advance of customers arriving at the store. Emergency procedures in place to address potential dangers. Explaining approach and entrance procedures to the arriving public. Not allowing additional customers to enter the store when it reaches its maximum occupancy level. Not blocking or locking exit doors. A fact sheet outlining these and other safety measures is available at https://www.osha.gov/OshDoc/data_General_Facts/Crowd_Control.html .

The investigations were conducted by the department's Wage and Hour Division, found that five contractors violated provisions of the Davis-Bacon and Related Acts as well as the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act, which resulted in the workers being underpaid and not receiving fringe benefits to which they were entitled. ""The misclassification of employees as independent contractors is unacceptable, and something we see all too often in industries that employ vulnerable workers and in which we've historically found significant wage violations,"" said Nancy J. Leppink, deputy administrator of the Wage and Hour Division. ""The federal government's financial support for significant work projects benefits businesses and is also meant, through Davis-Bacon, to maintain a level playing field among employers. Honest employers who play by the rules have a difficult time competing against scofflaws who gain an advantage by underpaying their workers. And workers and their families lose when they are denied the wages they rightfully deserve."" Investigators found that Complete Automation of Lake Orion, Mich., misclassified 48employees as independent contractors and failed to include them on the company's certified payroll. As a result, those employees were paid less than the required DBRA prevailing wage rates and fringe benefits. The employer also violated the CWHSSA when overtime compensation was paid at a lower rate to the workers because of their misclassification. The employer has paid the workers a total of $512,724 in back wages. Jesco Inc. of Fulton, Miss., improperly classified 34 workers as plumbers rather than pipefitters, resulting in those employees receiving less than the required DBRA prevailing wage rates for the type of work they actually performed. The employer violated the CWHSSA by incorrectly paying overtime compensation based on lower rates. Additionally, the employer required some workers to pay for lodging, which resulted in them receiving less than the prevailing wage and fringe benefits. The company has paid the workers a total of $234,701 in back wages. T.W. Frierson Contractor Inc. of Nashville, Tenn., improperly classified36 sheet metal and ironworkers as laborers, resulting in those employees receiving less than the required DBRA prevailing wage rates for the type of work they actually performed as well as incorrect overtime pay under the CWHSSA. The company has paid the workers a total of $34,033 in back wages. Electronics Automation Corp. of Columbus, Ohio, has paid five millwrights $5,455 in back wages for improperly classifying them as laborers, resulting in those employees receiving less than the required DBRA prevailing wage rates for the type of work they actually performed as well as incorrect overtime pay under the CWHSSA. Custom Window Covering of Antioch, Tenn., has paid one employee $635 in back wages for failing to pay the correct DBRA prevailing wage rate and fringe benefits for the work performed. ""Workers employed on federally funded projects deserve their full pay as required under federal law,"" said Sandra Sanders, director of the division's Nashville District Office. ""Employers are well aware of their obligations to pay prevailing wage rates when they enter such contracts. These investigations underscore the Labor Department's commitment to ensure that proper prevailing wages and fringe benefits are paid to employees working on government contracts. Other employers accepting taxpayer money to perform work on federally financed projects should take this as an opportunity to assess their own payroll practices to verify that they are paying their employees in compliance with federal law."" All of the contractors have agreed to full future compliance with the DBRA and CWHSSA, and to correct all issues identified by these investigations. The DBRA requires all contractors and subcontractors performing work on federal and certain federally funded projects to pay their laborers and mechanics proper prevailing wage rates and fringe benefits as determined by the secretary of labor. The CWHSSA applies to federal service contracts and federal and federally assisted construction contracts exceeding$100,000. It requires contractors and subcontractors on covered contracts to pay laborers and mechanics employed in the performance of the contracts one and one-half times their basic rate of pay for all hours worked over 40 in a week. This act also prohibits unsanitary, hazardous or dangerous working conditions on federal and federally financed and assisted construction projects.

The unpaid wages resulted from violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act's minimum wage, overtime and record-keeping provisions that were uncovered during an investigation by the U.S. Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division. ""This company profited from mistreating its hardworking, vulnerable, low-wage workers,"" said Cynthia Watson, the Wage and Hour Division's regional administrator in the Southwest. ""Employees worked as many as 75 hours in a workweek without overtime compensation. This is illegal."" The investigation, conducted by the division's San Antonio District Office, found that cooks, cashiers and bakery staff did not always receive at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, and were not paid the proper overtime rate of time and one-half for hours worked beyond 40 in a workweek. Instead, the employees were paid fixed salaries without regard to actual hours worked or the FLSA's requirements. The employer also failed to maintain the required record keeping. Panaderia Chuy Bakery produces bakery and pastry goods, and operates restaurants on Research Boulevard and East William Cannon Drive. The company has agreed to comply with the FLSA in the future and the back wages owed have been paid in full. The FLSA requires that covered, nonexempt employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 for all hours worked, plus time and one-half their regular rates, including commissions, bonuses and incentive pay, for hours worked beyond 40 per week. Additionally, employers must maintain accurate time and payroll records.

"November 14, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20121114-0,US Labor Department seeks court enforcement of order requiring Star Air to reinstate 2 wrongfully terminated Ohio truck drivers,"AKRON, Ohio – The U.S. Department of Labor has filed a lawsuit in federal court seeking to enforce a final decision and order issued to North Canton-based trucking company Star Air and owner Robert R. Custer for terminating two truck drivers in violation of the Surface Transportation Assistance Act's whistleblower provisions. The company has been ordered to pay $612,205. The Labor Department's Administrative Review Board issued a final decision to Star Air on Dec. 19, 2011, requiring the company to reinstate the two employees and pay $602,366, including back wages in the amount of $341,894 for one driver and $181,468 for the other, as well as $79,004 in attorney fees. On Jan. 18, 2012, the review board ordered Star Air to pay supplemental attorney fees of $9,839. To date, Star Air has not taken any action to comply, prompting the department's suit, which has been filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, Eastern Division in Akron. The department is represented by its Regional Office of the Solicitor in Cleveland. ""These drivers were fired for trying to protect themselves and the driving public,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health Dr. David Michaels. ""OSHA will continue to defend America's truck drivers who are retaliated against by unscrupulous employers when they refuse to drive while fatigued, ill, or in violation of truck weight or hours-of-service requirements."" The drivers were dismissed after one was stopped by West Virginia State Police and cited for hauling an excess load without a commercial driver's license; operating an overweight trailer; driving a commercial vehicle that did not have the name of the company, its home base and its U.S. Department of Transportation number displayed; and driving without a log book. The driver who was cited told the other driver, and both refused to continue driving until these issues were resolved. Consequently, both were terminated. Both drivers filed complaints with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration alleging that Star Air had discriminated against them in retaliation for activities protected by the STAA, and a Labor Department administrative law judge issued the order for reinstatement and back wages. Under automatic review provisions, the judge's decision then was referred to and upheld by the Administrative Review Board, which issues final decisions for the secretary of labor in cases arising under a wide range of worker protection laws. OSHA enforces the whistleblower provisions of the STAA and 21 other statutes protecting employees who report violations of various airline, commercial motor carrier, consumer product, environmental, financial reform, food safety, motor vehicle safety, health care reform, nuclear, pipeline, public transportation agency, railroad, maritime and securities laws. Employers are prohibited from retaliating against employees who raise various protected concerns or provide protected information to the employer or the government. Employees who believe that they have been retaliated against for engaging in protected conduct may file a complaint with the secretary of labor for an investigation by OSHA's Whistleblower Protection Program.

"November 14, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20121114,"US Labor Department recovers back wages for student workers, fines companies for labor violations at warehouse in Palmyra, Pa.","PHILADELPHIA – The U.S. Department of Labor has recovered more than $213,000 in back wages for 1,028 foreign students employed in summer jobs in Palmyra where they repackaged candies for promotional displays. The settlement with The SHS Group, LP, the Council for Educational Travel-USA, and Exel Inc. resolves federal minimum wage and overtime violations, and also resolves $143,000 in fines for safety and health violations found at an Exel-operated facility in Palmyra. The settlement also includes commitments by Exel to implement pro-active procedures to help ensure future FLSA and OSHA compliance at each of their over 300 facilities across the country. The department's Wage and Hour Division investigation found violations of the minimum wage and overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act as a result of excessive housing costs charged to the foreign students employed at the Palmyra facility, which reduced their hourly wages below the amount they were required to be paid under the FLSA. Under the settlement agreement, the three companies have agreed to pay $213,042 in back wages to the foreign students who were participating in the State Department's Summer Work Travel program, which is designed to promote educational and cultural exchange. The SHS Group, LP, under a contract with Exel, hired and placed the students at the Palmyra work site. The Council for Educational Travel-USA acted as the students' sponsor in the program. The State Department has since terminated the Council for Education Travel-USA's designation as a program sponsor. In addition to recovering back wages for the foreign students, an additional civil money penalty was assessed against SHS for repeat violations of the FLSA. As part of the FLSA settlement, Exel has agreed to implement a voluntary compliance program that provides enterprisewide relief at all its U.S. facilities to ensure compliance with the FLSA. The terms of the settlement require Exel to review each of its facilities' compliance with minimum wage, overtime and record-keeping provisions; train workplace managers and supervisors regarding minimum wage and overtime requirements; maintain a hotline for workers in the event they believe their FLSA rights have been violated; remedy any violations it finds or that are brought to its attention; require its third-party labor service providers to remedy violations it finds among those service providers; amend its standard labor service provider contracts to include FLSA compliance commitments; and maintain a log of all FLSA problems it finds or are brought to its attention for the next three years. The FLSA requires that covered employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour as well as time and one-half their regular rates for every hour they work beyond 40 per week. The law also requires employers to maintain accurate records of employees' wages, hours and other conditions of employment, and prohibits employers from retaliating against employees who exercise their rights under the law. For more information about the FLSA and other federal wage laws, call the Wage and Hour Division's toll-free helpline at 866-4US-WAGE (487-9243). Information also is available at http://www.dol.gov/whd/ . ""We are pleased by the efforts Exel in particular will be making to ensure future compliance,"" said Nancy J. Leppink, deputy administrator of the department's Wage and Hour Division. ""The decision of these companies to play by the rules is a positive step that will ensure that workers are treated fairly, as is legally required."" The Labor Department and Exel have also entered into a settlement agreement that resolves citations issued by the department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration for violations of OSHA's occupational noise exposure standard and record-keeping regulations. Exel has agreed to pay $143,000 in penalties. Exel will implement a site-specific record-keeping policy, a noise abatement plan and a hearing conservation program at the Palmyra facility. Exel will also implement revised polices that address noise exposure at all Exel production facilities and record-keeping policies at all facilities nationwide. Additionally, Exel will revise its U.S. Corporate Wide Incentive Program to eliminate incentive payments based on the number of reported or recorded injuries and illnesses at a facility. This action is consistent with OSHA's current efforts to eliminate ""bonus"" plans that potentially incentivize nonreporting of injuries or illnesses. ""We are pleased that Exel has agreed to revamp its injury and illness record-keeping program and to change its incentive program,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health Dr. David Michaels. ""When workers don't feel free to report injuries or illnesses, the employer's entire workforce is put at risk. Exel's actions will positively impact the safety and health of its workers."" Exel has agreed to address occupational noise at all its production facilities nationwide. Exel will hire a qualified safety consultant who within 90 days will conduct an audit of the noise exposure levels in all production facilities and will submit to OSHA a noise abatement plan and a hearing conservation program that will be implemented at each production facility. Exel has agreed to revise its record-keeping policy and for each facility will designate a permanent job position with ultimate authority for overseeing and reviewing record-keeping practices, and will provide record-keeping training to all employees with record-keeping responsibilities within 120 days. Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees.

"November 13, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20121113,US Labor Department recovers nearly $220 million for Madoff victims,"NEW YORK — The U.S. Department of Labor today announced a settlement that includes the payment of nearly $220 million to compensate employee benefit plans and other investors that suffered losses through investments in Bernard L. Madoff's Ponzi scheme. The settlement is pending approval by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and resolves department litigation, actions brought by New York's attorney general, and several private lawsuits and class actions brought on behalf of plans and other investors that invested with Madoff. The settlement was reached with Ivy Asset Management LLC, J.P. Jeanneret Associates Inc., Beacon Associates Management Corp., Andover Associates Management Corp., and their current and former owners and officers. ""The settlement agreement we're announcing today provides a measure of justice for those Americans who worked hard to prepare for their retirement and then saw hoped-for stability disappear,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""My department is committed to ensuring that workers and retirees receive the benefits they've earned and deserve. If approved by the court, this settlement, combined with expected payments from the Madoff bankruptcy estate, will allow worker benefit plans impacted by Bernard Madoff's illegal and reprehensible scheme to recover all, or nearly all, of the money they invested with him."" ""Today's settlement brings accountability for one of the greatest financial frauds in American history and justice to defrauded investors. We have recovered over $210 million for the victims who were harmed as a result of the world's most notorious Ponzi scheme,"" said New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. ""Ivy Asset Management violated its fundamental responsibility as an investment adviser by putting its own pecuniary interests ahead of the interests of its clients. An investment adviser should apprise its clients of risks, but Ivy deliberately concealed negative facts it uncovered in its due diligence of Madoff in order to keep earning millions of dollars in fees. As a result, its clients suffered massive and avoidable losses."" The department sued Ivy, Jeanneret, Beacon, Andover and their owners and officers Oct. 21, 2010, for alleged violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The suit alleged that they breached their fiduciary duties to a number of benefit plans by recommending, making and maintaining investments with Madoff, thus losing hundreds of millions of dollars in assets needed for the pension and health benefits of thousands of workers. ""Nothing can make up for the years-long agony that plan administrators and participants, and individual investors were put through by these defendants and Madoff,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Employee Benefits Security Phyllis C. Borzi. ""But this settlement should go a long way toward making victims financially whole and, hopefully, closing a painful chapter for many workers and families."" Ivy served as the investment adviser for Jeanneret, Beacon and Andover, and introduced those parties to Madoff. The suit alleged that Ivy misrepresented and concealed doubts and suspicions about Madoff, including the belief that no investment with Madoff was justified. The suit further alleged that Ivy concealed its suspicions because the investments made by Jeanneret, Beacon, and their plan clients and other investors generated enormous fees for Ivy and contributed significantly to the assets under Ivy's management. The department alleged that Ivy made the decision not to sacrifice those financial benefits by disclosing the true nature of its doubts about Madoff, especially because management did not think the company could escape legal liability for those investments. Jeanneret served as the investment manager for more than 70 plans that invested with Madoff through several methods, including its own fund of funds, starting in 1991. The department's suit alleged that the company and its principals made material misrepresentations and failed to disclose material facts to their ERISA-covered plan clients that invested with Madoff. These included failing to disclose that Ivy had informed Jeanneret that it was unable to perform due diligence on Madoff. Jeanneret also allegedly failed to disclose to its clients that it had entered into a new agreement with Ivy in 2007 that eliminated Madoff from Ivy's due diligence responsibilities, and failed to disclose that Ivy recommended Jeanneret reduce plan client and investor exposure to Madoff. Additionally, the suit alleged that Jeanneret largely ignored Ivy's recommendations to reduce its clients' Madoff investments and failed to take prudent steps to investigate irregularities about Madoff and his purported trading, while taking substantial amounts in fees as the investment manager for the plans. Finally, Jeanneret and its owners and officers allegedly violated ERISA based on their fee arrangement, which provided for higher fees for Madoff investments than for other types of investments. This arrangement gave them the ability to set their own compensation by exercising their discretion to recommend and make Madoff investments for plans. Beacon and Andover were the investment managers for the Beacon and Andover funds, which invested heavily with Madoff starting in the early 1990s. Many employee benefit plans, including Jeanneret's clients, invested in the Beacon and Andover funds. Like Jeanneret, the department alleged that the two fund companies and their owners and officers largely ignored Ivy's recommendations to reduce their Madoff investments and failed to take prudent steps to investigate Madoff, while still taking substantial amounts in fees as the investment managers for the Beacon and Andover funds. The suit also charged Beacon, Andover and their principals with making misrepresentations and failing to disclose to their plan investors that Ivy had informed them it was unable to perform due diligence on Madoff, and that Beacon and Andover had entered into agreements with Ivy that eliminated Madoff from Ivy's due diligence responsibilities. Under the settlement agreement, Ivy and its principals have agreed to pay a total of $210 million. Jeanneret and its owners, John P. Jeanneret and Paul Perry, have agreed to pay $3 million. Beacon and Andover and their owners, Joel Danziger and Harris Markhoff, have agreed to pay $3.5 million and relinquish a claim of more than $3.3 million for management fees. The settlements resulted from investigations conducted by the New York and Boston regional offices of the Employee Benefits Security Administration, an agency of the Labor Department. Litigation was conducted by the Plan Benefits Security Division of the department's Office of the Solicitor in Washington, D.C. Workers in employer-sponsored health and retirement benefit plans who feel that they have been denied a benefit inappropriately, or have questions about benefits laws, can contact an EBSA benefits adviser by visiting https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ebsa/about-ebsa/ask-a-question/ask-ebsa or calling 866-444-EBSA (3272).

"November 8, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/opa/opa20121108,Statement by Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis honoring Veterans Day by encouraging US employers to put our military heroes to work,"WASHINGTON – Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis today released the following statement encouraging U.S. employers to commemorate the Veterans Day holiday Monday by making a commitment to hiring veterans: ""On Monday, America will celebrate the sacrifices of the men and women who've served their country in the armed forces. I strongly believe that the best way we can honor our veterans is to employ them. ""We've now lowered our unemployment rate for our veterans to 6.3 percent well below the national average and brought down the jobless rate for Iraq and Afghanistan veterans by more than two percentage points in the last year alone. We're making progress, but our work will not be done until everyone who has worn the uniform can find civilian jobs worthy of their heroic sacrifice. ""Through boot camp and pre-deployment training, the U.S. government spends 8-12 weeks preparing our outstanding soldiers, sailors and airmen to serve. Now that we're winding down a decade of war overseas, it's critical that we spend some time preparing these heroes for the transition back to civilian life. Over the next five years, the Department of Labor will help more than 1 million transitioning service members find jobs when they come home. We're helping them with job search strategies and resume writing, and showing them how to market their world-class military training to secure good-paying civilian jobs. ""Every day, the Labor Department is working to help employers recruit veterans to fill open positions and to go out into local communities to make the case for hiring veterans. America's veterans are dependable, hardworking and loyal. Teamwork and commitment to the mission at hand are hard-wired into their DNA. They've received world-class training from one of the most demanding organizations in the world and been tested in pressure-cooker situations that few of us can imagine. ""Those who fight to protect our freedoms abroad should not have to fight for jobs when they come home. They deserve a chance to use their unique skills to help re-grow our economy. So this Veterans Day, I encourage employers to make the commitment to put our veterans to work for them. It's an act of patriotism that's good for our country and good for their bottom line. ""We're also focused on doing more to assist our homeless veterans, including many women who've come home with unique combat-related problems. On any given night, tens of thousands of vets go to sleep on our streets and under our bridges. We've made huge progress in reducing the number of homeless veterans by focusing on affordable housing first.

Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century CHICAGO – An investigation by the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration found that Northern Illinois Flight Center violated the whistleblower protection provisions of the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century, known as AIR21, by illegally terminating an employee. The whistleblower, a pilot from Illinois, was dismissed after contacting the Federal Aviation Administration to discuss violations of the pilot certification process. As a result, OSHA has ordered the company to immediately reinstate the employee and pay more than $500,000 in back wages, benefits and damages. ""Firing pilots for reporting inaccurate procedures to the FAA endangers other pilots, their passengers and the public at large,"" said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health Dr. David Michaels. ""The Labor Department has a responsibility to protect all employees, including those in the aviation industry, from retaliation for raising safety concerns and exercising these basic worker rights."" The pilot alleges that he was asked to falsify an FAA Form 61.55 pilot certification for a training flight he performed with another pilot. He maintained that all required elements were not completed during the training flight conducted Feb. 16, 2009, so he could not certify the form. He also alleges that, on March 23, Northern Illinois Flight Center supervisors attempted to coerce him into signing a backdated and incorrect form. During a subsequent conversation, the pilot informed his supervisors that he wanted to contact the FAA directly to get clarification on the issue, and between March 25 and 27, the pilot contacted the FAA Flight Standards District. The pilot was terminated April 7, with no reason stated. The investigation, conducted by OSHA's Chicago office, upheld the pilot's allegations and found that he would not have been terminated if he had not requested to meet with the FAA for the purpose of discussing the pilot certification process and forms. Northern Illinois Flight Center is based in Lake in the Hills and employs pilots to fly aircraft for the transportation of passengers and property. OSHA conducted the investigation under the whistleblower provisions of AIR21, which protects employees who report alleged violations of any order, regulation, or standard of the FAA or any other provision of federal law relating to air carrier safety under this subtitle or any other law of the United States, or who engage in other protected activities. OSHA enforces the whistleblower provisions of the AIR21 and 21 other statutes protecting employees who report violations of various railroad, commercial motor carrier, consumer product, environmental, financial reform, food safety, health care reform, nuclear, pipeline, public transportation agency, maritime and securities laws. Employers are prohibited from retaliating against employees who raise various protected concerns or provide protected information to the employer or to the government. Any party to this case can file an appeal with the Labor Department's Office of Administrative Law Judges within 30 days of receipt of the findings. Employees who believe that they have been retaliated against for engaging in protected conduct may file a complaint with the secretary of labor to request an investigation by OSHA's Whistleblower Protection Program. Detailed information on employee whistleblower rights, including fact sheets, is available at http://www.whistleblowers.gov . Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. OSHA's role is to ensure these conditions for America's working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education and assistance.

Additionally, our economy added back more than 84,000 jobs in August and September than had been initially reported. ""October's report marks 32 straight months of private sector job growth totaling more than 5.4 million jobs. We've also seen 13 consecutive quarters of private gross domestic product growth. In other words, we've been consistently growing jobs and our economy for several years running. ""Our unemployment rate has dropped by more than two percentage points under President Obama. Unemployment Insurance claims are at a four-year low. Consumer sentiment is at a four-year high. We've added more than a half-million manufacturing jobs over the last 32 months. And we just posted the largest 12-month increase in housing permits since 1983. ""We've transformed a terrible crisis into a stable and durable recovery. To state otherwise is to wage war on the facts. We've erased all of the private sector job losses since the president took office and created an additional 1.2 million new jobs. ""We know what works, and the president has a plan to accelerate our progress by investing in education and job training, and by creating good-paying 21st century jobs in health care, energy, technology and manufacturing. Our recovery depends on building a strong and educated middle class that creates enough demand for the private sector to keep adding new jobs.

"November 1, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20121101,US Labor Department's MSHA places increased emphasis on miner discrimination complaints,"ARLINGTON, Va. – The U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration filed 39 requests during fiscal year 2012, more than in any other year, with the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission for temporary reinstatements on behalf of miners who submitted complaints of discrimination in the form of a suspension, layoff, discharge or other adverse action. From October 2009 through September 2012, the department filed 79 temporary reinstatement requests – an average of 26 per year – compared to an average of seven per year from October 1993 to September 2009. Additionally, the department filed a total of 84 discrimination complaints with the commission during the same period, compared to 28 during the three prior years combined. According to Section 105(c) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, a miner cannot be discharged, discriminated against or interfered with in the exercise of statutory rights because he or she has engaged in a protected activity such as filing a complaint alleging a health or safety violation, or refusing to work under unsafe or unhealthy conditions. ""MSHA strongly encourages miners to exercise their rights under the Mine Act and maximize their involvement in monitoring safety and health conditions,"" said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. ""In turn, we will vigorously investigate all discrimination complaints."" If MSHA finds that a miner's complaint is ""not frivolously brought,"" the agency, at the request of the miner, will ask the commission to order immediate reinstatement for the miner. Issues relating to fears of discrimination and retaliation came to light during congressional hearings held in the wake of the Upper Big Branch Mine disaster. Statements from miners and family members of the miners who died indicated that mine employees had been reluctant to speak out about safety conditions in existence prior to the April 2010 explosion, fearing retaliation by management. Testimony from UBB employees presented during MSHA's investigation also supports those claims."

Youth services programs, educators and others helping young job seekers prepare for employment are encouraged to view, display, share and lead discussions about the videos, which aim to help all youth, including those with disabilities, develop and strengthen six essential skills needed to succeed in today's workforce: communication, networking, enthusiasm and attitude, teamwork, problem-solving and critical thinking, and professionalism. Although employers have identified these skills as being among the most important competencies young workers need, three-quarters of those participating in a survey by the Conference Board, Corporate Voices for Working Families, the Partnership for 21st Century Skills and the Society for Human Resource Management ranked new high school graduates as deficient in soft skill areas.

"October 25, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ilab/ilab20121025,US Department of Labor awards $1.5 million to Tulane Universitys Payson Center for research on child labor in West African cocoa-growing areas,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of International Labor Affairs has awarded a $1.5 million cooperative agreement to Tulane University's Payson Center for International Development in New Orleans to carry out research on the prevalence of child labor in cocoa-growing areas of Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana. Tulane will develop a baseline estimate of the number of children engaged in the worst forms of child labor in these areas based on survey data from 2008-2009 as well as a new survey of activities during the 2013-2014 cocoa harvest season. As part of this award, Tulane will provide technical assistance to help enhance the capacity of the countries' national statistical offices to conduct similar surveys in the future. Tulane also will develop a manual that can be used to replicate its research design and survey implementation methodology. This award illustrates the Labor Department's continuing commitment to achieve the goals of the 2010 Declaration of Joint Action to Implement the Harkin-Engel Protocol, which was signed by Secretary Hilda L. Solis, the labor ministers of Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana, and a representative of the International Chocolate and Cocoa Industry. The international chocolate and cocoa industry similarly committed itself to funding programs under the declaration. To date, eight companies (Barry Callebaut, Ferrero, Hershey, Kraft, Mars, Nestle, Archer Daniels Midland and Cargill) have allocated another $10 million to reduce the worst forms of child labor in cocoa-producing areas of Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana. All of these programs are designed to reinforce broader efforts being undertaken by the governments of Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana to address child labor, including the promotion of educational opportunities for children and economic opportunities for their households, and the expansion of community-based child labor monitoring systems and social protection services. For more information on efforts under the declaration of joint action, read the Oct. 5, 2011, statement of progress on reducing child labor in Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana at http://www.dol.gov/ilab/programs/ocft/news.htm."
"October 25, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20121025-0,"US Labor Department sues Tulsa, Okla.-based Mexican restaurant group, owner to recover $1 million in unpaid wages for employees","Violations found at 4 locations in Broken Arrow, Owasso and Tulsa TULSA, Okla.  The U.S. Department of Labor has filed a lawsuit against Tulsa-based El Tequila LLC and owner Carlos Aguirre after an investigation by the department's Wage and Hour Division found that the defendants violated the Fair Labor Standards Act's minimum wage, overtime and record-keeping provisions. These violations resulted in a total of approximately $1 million in unpaid wages owed to 221 kitchen and wait staff, hosts and bussers at four restaurant locations. The suit was filed in the Northern District of Oklahoma, Tulsa Division, and it seeks to recover the full amount of back wages for the employees as well as an injunction prohibiting future violations of the FLSA. ""The restaurant industry employs some of our country's lowest-paid, most vulnerable workers,"" said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ""When violations of the FLSA are discovered, the Labor Department will take appropriate action to ensure workers receive the wages they have earned and to which they are legally entitled."" The investigation, conducted by the division's Oklahoma City District Office, determined that FLSA-covered employees, who in some cases worked as many as 72 hours in a week, were paid a fixed salary without overtime compensation for hours beyond 40 in a week. In addition to overtime violations, this practice resulted in minimum wage violations because employees did not always receive at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. Investigators also found that wait personnel were required to turn their tips over to management at the end of every shift, which caused their pay to fall below the minimum wage. Finally, the employer did not keep proper records as required. Violations were found at the company's restaurants on Memorial Drive and South Harvard Avenue in Tulsa, East 86nd Street North in Owasso and North Elm Place in Broken Arrow. The FLSA requires that covered, nonexempt employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 for all hours worked, plus time and one-half their regular rates for hours worked beyond 40 per week. In accordance with the FLSA, an employer of a tipped employee is required to pay no less than $2.13 an hour in direct wages provided that amount plus the tips received equals at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. If an employee's tips combined with the employer's direct wages do not equal the minimum wage, the employer must make up the difference. Employers are required to provide employees notice of the FLSA's tip credit provisions, to maintain accurate time and payroll records, and to comply with the act's restrictions applying to workers under age 18. For more information about federal wage laws, call the Wage and Hour Division's toll-free helpline at 866-4US-WAGE (487-9243) or its Oklahoma City office at 405-231-4158.

"October 25, 2012",https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20121025,US Labor Department seeks enforcement of subpoena issued to Forever 21,"Recent investigation reveals evidence of wage violations among Forever 21 apparel contractors and manufacturer LOS ANGELES — The U.S. Department of Labor has filed an action to enforce a subpoena issued to Los Angeles-based apparel retailer Forever 21 seeking documents related to the company's apparel contractors and manufacturers. A recent investigation by the department's Wage and Hour Division, conducted under a multiyear enforcement initiative in Southern California's garment industry, revealed evidence of significant violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act's minimum wage, overtime and record-keeping provisions by vendors supplying goods to Forever 21. ""We are disappointed that Forever 21 has refused to cooperate with the subpoena, particularly given the significant problems we have found among its suppliers. Since 2008, our investigators have identified dozens of manufacturers producing goods for Forever 21 under sweatshop-like conditions,"" said Ruben Rosalez, regional administrator for the division in the West. ""When companies like Forever 21 refuse to comply with subpoenas, they demonstrate a clear disregard for the law, and the Labor Department will use all enforcement tools available to recover workers' wages and hold employers accountable."" The FLSA authorizes the secretary of labor to investigate and gather data regarding wages, hours, and other conditions and practices of employment. The Labor Department has the legal authority to issue subpoenas for the production of relevant documents and information relating to any matter under investigation. Forever 21 has refused to provide the documents requested by the secretary in the subpoena. As a result, the department's Regional Office of the Solicitor in Los Angeles has filed this action to compel compliance with the subpoena. The Wage and Hour Division historically has found repeated and widespread violations of the FLSA's minimum wage, overtime and record-keeping provisions in Southern California's garment industry. The division's enforcement initiative is concentrating on employers in Los Angeles and Orange counties, as well as those operating out of large garment buildings in Los Angeles' Fashion District. In the past five years alone, the division's Los Angeles, San Diego and West Covina offices have conducted more than 1,500 investigations under the initiative. Ninety-three percent of these investigations uncovered violations, and the division found more than $11 million in back wages due to approximately 11,000 workers. The FLSA requires that covered employees be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 for all hours worked, plus time and one-half their regular rates, including commissions, bonuses and incentive pay, for hours worked beyond 40 per week. In general, ""hours worked"" includes all time an employee must be on duty, or on the employer's premises or at any other prescribed place of work, from the beginning of the first principal work activity to the end of the last principal activity of the workday. Employees in the garment industry are typically paid a fixed amount for each garment they produce, an amount that is often so low workers' wages fall below the federal minimum wage and do not meet overtime compensation requirements. Additionally, the law requires that accurate records of employees' wages, hours and other conditions of employment be maintained, and prohibits employers from retaliating against employees who exercise their rights under the law. For more information about the FLSA and other federal wage laws, call the division's toll-free helpline at 866-4US-WAGE (487-9243), its Los Angeles office at 213-894-6375 or its West Covina office at 626-966-0478.

Additionally, the company made illegal wage deductions for such items as calipers, micrometers and other hand tools, resulting in wages falling below the federal minimum wage.

""The Wage and Hour Division has an ongoing enforcement initiative in Florida as well as in other states to remedy widespread noncompliance in the restaurant industry. Our goal is to protect workers and ensure a level playing field for honest employers who follow the law and pay their employees fair wages."" Investigators found systemic violations resulting from the company's failure to properly compensate tip-earning employees, such as delivery drivers, for all of their hours worked. Even when performing nontipped duties such as cooking, cleaning and stocking, the workers were paid as if they were tipped employees, with hourly wage rates as low as $5.15 rather than the required federal minimum wage of $7.25. The employer also made illegal deductions from employees' wages for uniforms, and failed to properly calculate and compensate tipped employees for all overtime hours (those worked in excess of 40 in a week).

The goal is to design a tool that demonstrates the importance of recognizing and preventing hazards by helping young people understand their rights in the workplace. Submissions may be designed for Internet browsers, smartphones, feature phones and social media platforms, or as native Windows or Macintosh applications. The deadline is Nov. 30. ""New technologies have the promise of making our safety and health resources even more accessible for workers and employers,"" said Dr. David Michaels, assistant secretary of labor for occupational safety and health. ""Successful proposals could take many different forms, such as interactive and informative games, a smartphone app, social or professional networks, or data visualization."" Each submission should meet both of the following objectives: Demonstrate the importance of knowing about workplace safety and health hazards: Components should be included that inform young workers about hazards in the workplace and the serious consequences of workplace injuries. Information on safety and health from the department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, state workers' compensation programs and/or other government sources must be incorporated.
