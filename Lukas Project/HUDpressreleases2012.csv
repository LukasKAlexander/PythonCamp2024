01/04/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-001.cfm,HUD Suspends Philadelphia Company and President,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today announced that it immediately suspended James H. Grier and Mantua Gardens East, Inc. (MGE) of Philadelphia from doing business with the U.S. Government. In addition to the immediate suspension announced today, HUD also proposed their debarments to prevent Grier and the company from participating in government-related business for a period of five years.
HUD's actions are based upon Grier and MGE's improper withdrawal of $325,000 from reserves without HUD approval and submission of false and misleading financial reports to HUD. MGE also failed to provide sufficient notice to tenants of its intention to opt out of the Section 8 project-based program, thereby denying the tenants adequate time to make housing arrangements, and threatening them with eviction.
""As president of this Company, Mr. Grier, through a number of acts and omissions, was responsible for MGE's violations of important HUD requirements,"" said Helen Kanovsky, HUD's General Counsel. ""By failing properly to notify their tenants, Mr. Grier and his company deprived them of an important legal right to make other housing arrangements and to spare them from the possibility of eviction.""
Background:
In December of 1970, MGE agreed to a $720,000 mortgage loan insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). As an FHA mortgagor, MGE is required to establish and maintain a reserve account to meet emergency needs at the multi-family housing development, which comprises ten buildings located in Philadelphia's University City neighborhood. In 2008, Grier and MGE improperly withdrew $325,000 in reserves without required HUD approval and then refused to restore those funds to the Company's reserve account. Grier and MGE then pledged those funds, along with one of the development's buildings and future rent payments, as collateral for a separate loan from a lending institution. This misappropriation of reserve funds and unauthorized encumbrance of property are serious violations of FHA requirements. Grier and MGE also filed a false and misleading annual financial report to HUD by failing to note this new liability.
For approximately 27 years, MGE received project-based Section 8 subsidies under a Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) Contract with HUD. Under the terms of the Contract, MGE was entitled to opt out of the contract, but was first required to provide one year's advance notice to the tenants. That notice would have allowed tenants sufficient time to make other housing arrangements. In October of 2011, MGE notified HUD that it was opting out of the program, failed to properly notify tenants, and instead threatened them with eviction."
01/09/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-002.cfm,Obama Administration Releases December Housing Scorecard,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of the Treasury today released the December edition of the Obama Administration's Housing Scorecard - a comprehensive report on the nation's housing market. Data in the December Housing Scorecard show some subtle improvements in the market over the past year, but underscore fragility as the overall outlook remains mixed. For example, new and existing home sales rose compared to the prior month and remain higher than a year ago, and homes are more affordable than they have been since 1971. Median-income families today have nearly double the funds needed to cover the cost of the average home. However, home prices showed a slight dip from the prior month and remain below year ago levels. The full report is available online at www.hud.gov/scorecard.
HUD Assistant Secretary Raphael Bostic said, ""As we compare today's data to market data from last year - and certainly from the economic conditions when we took office in 2009 - it's clear that we've made important progress in recovering from this housing crisis. But with so many homeowners still struggling to pay their mortgages or move into more sustainable loans, we can not rest on our laurels. There is still a lot of work to do. That's why the Obama Administration continues to push hard for effective implementation of our recovery programs to help more underwater borrowers and unemployed or underemployed homeowners stay in their homes whenever possible.""
""The Administration's programs have set standards that have benefitted millions of families across the country and helped them avoid foreclosure,"" said Treasury Assistant Secretary for Financial Stability Tim Massad. ""We remain committed to helping as many families as we can while the housing market continues to recover.""
The December Housing Scorecard features key data on the health of the housing market and the impact of the Administration's foreclosure prevention programs, including:
The Administration's recovery efforts continue to help millions of families deal with the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, even as new mortgage delinquencies continue to decline. More than 5.5 million modification arrangements were started between April 2009 and the end of November 2011 - including more than 1.7 million HAMP trial modification starts and more than 1.1 million FHA loss mitigation and early delinquency interventions. Nearly 910,000 homeowners have received a HAMP permanent modification to date, saving an estimated $9.9 billion in monthly mortgage payments. The Administration's programs continue to encourage improved standards and processes in the industry, with HOPE Now lenders offering families and individuals more than 2.6 million proprietary mortgage modifications through November. Eligible homeowners entering HAMP have a high likelihood of earning a permanent modification and realizing long-term success. Eighty-three percent of eligible homeowners entering HAMP since June 1, 2010 received a permanent modification, with an average trial period of 3.5 months. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)'s Mortgage Metrics Report (www.occ.gov/publications/publications-by-type/other-publications-reports/index-mortgage-metrics.html) for the Third Quarter of 2011 found that HAMP continues to prove more sustainable for homeowners than industry modifications, as a result of HAMP's emphasis on affordability relative to a homeowner's income and successful completion of a trial payment period.

01/10/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-003.cfm,HUD Awards $3.6 Million in Choice Neighborhoods Planning Grants,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Shaun Donovan announced today that 13 communities across the U.S. will receive $3.6 million in Choice Neighborhoods Planning Grants. (See attached list (PDF) and project summary for this all of the grantees (PDF).)
""All across the country, local planners are serious about rolling up their sleeves to transform distressed neighborhoods into choice neighborhoods,"" said Donovan. ""These communities can now begin the comprehensive planning needed to turn distressed housing and long-neglected neighborhoods into viable and sustainable mixed-income communities that support positive outcome for families.""
Building on nearly 20 years of success through HUD's HOPE VI Program, Choice Neighborhoods links housing improvements with a wider variety of public services including schools, public transit and employment opportunities. The program is a centerpiece of the Obama Administration's interagency Neighborhood Revitalization Initiative (www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/oua/initiatives/neighborhood-revitalization), a collaboration between HUD and the Departments of Education, Justice, Treasury and Health and Human Services. With support from the White House Domestic Policy Council and White House Office of Urban Affairs, the interagency partnership supports local solutions for sustainable, mixed-income neighborhoods with the affordable housing, safe streets and good schools all families need.
As a result of partnerships like these, the Obama Administration is making it easier for local leaders who are working to redevelop neighborhoods to also access support for cradle-to-career educational programs through the Education Department's Promise Neighborhoods initiative, public safety strategies through the Justice Department, and community health center improvements through the Department of Health and Human Services.
HUD received 71 submissions for FY 2011 Choice Neighborhoods Planning Grants from communities across the U.S. Successful applicants demonstrated their intent to transform neighborhoods while leveraging outside investments and other federal dollars to plan for high-quality public schools, outstanding education and early learning programs, public assets, public transportation, and improved access to jobs and well-functioning services. HUD is focused on directing resources to address three core goals - housing, people and neighborhoods.
The communities awarded the planning grants announced today will build the capacity needed to undertake a successful neighborhood transformation and create a choice neighborhood. These grants enable communities to create a comprehensive Transformation Plan, or road map, to transform distressed public and/or assisted housing within a distressed community. This Federal support provides a significant incentive for the local community to take critical steps to create viable neighborhood transformation.
Recently, HUD announced Partner.HUD.gov, an innovative online platform to spotlight comprehensive information about grantees and top-tier applicants with the hope that others will consider providing resources. This web portal is intended to provide information funders and other local stakeholders can use to support applications that HUD deemed promising, but was unable to fund. The site also offers communities greater access to similar work happening around the country and provides best-practice models that might help shape their efforts. Today's 2011 Choice Neighborhoods Planning Grant recipients and the eight competitive runners-up, will be featured on Partner.HUD.gov next week.
Congress approved the Choice Neighborhoods Initiative with the passage of HUD's FY 2010 budget, and in FY 2011 authorized HUD to use $65 million to provide competitive grants to assist in the transformation, rehabilitation and preservation of public housing and privately owned HUD-assisted housing. Congress recently appropriated $120 million for Fiscal Year 2012. Choice Neighborhoods builds on the successes and lessons of HUD's HOPE VI program and widens the traditional pool of eligible applicants beyond public housing authorities to include local governments, nonprofit organizations, and for-profit developers (who apply jointly with a public entity)."
01/10/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-005.cfm,HUD Makes $2 Million Available for Housing Counseling Training,"WASHINGTON - As part of its continuing effort to provide quality housing counseling to the nation's homeowners, buyers and renters, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced the availability of $2 million in grants for housing counseling training. HUD's goal is to fund eligible organizations to deliver training across the full spectrum of counseling services.
""These funds for training will help HUD-approved housing counseling organizations be better prepared to offer valuable services assisting families in making better choices in buying or renting homes and in helping thousands of struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure and remain in their homes,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""We are pleased that Congress heard our arguments for the vital role housing counseling plays and restored funding for housing counseling in HUD's Fiscal Year 2012 budget. We are now working to ensure these resources are used as effectively as possible and this training will help us do that.""
HUD-approved counseling agencies provide homeownership counseling as well as financial literacy education to renters and homeless individuals and families. This year, HUD's Housing Counseling Grant program will provide more than $40 million for comprehensive counseling, Reverse Mortgage Counseling, and supplemental funding for Mortgage Modification and Mortgage Scam Assistance.
The counseling training funds announced today are available to provide training activities designed to improve and standardize the quality of counseling provided by HUD-approved housing counseling agencies, multi-state organizations, and state housing finance agencies. The Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) provides funding details and requirements. It is posted on the HUD website.
Applicants must be public or private nonprofit organizations and must have ""tax exempt"" status under section 501(a) pursuant to section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 USC 501(a) and (c)(3). Applicants must have at least two years of experience providing housing counseling training services nationwide. They must propose to provide training nationwide.
Instructions are posted on Grants.gov. Applications must be submitted electronically through http://www.grants.gov and must be received by Grants.gov no later than 11:59:59 pm eastern time on February 7, 2012.

01/10/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-006.cfm,HUD Makes $110 Million Available to Revitalize Communities,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced today that it is making available $110 million in grants to transform public and assisted housing and to revitalize communities. Appearing in today's Federal Register is the Notice of Funding Availability, the federal application, for the FY 2012 Choice Neighborhoods Implementation Program. Read HUD's funding notice (www.grants.gov/search/search.do;jsessionid=KS17PMrRLP1B14vxvRjht8tg5hBvJRhdGQpnflnkTWk5H8v1GJnB!-408580364?oppId=137313&mode=VIEW).
For nearly 20 years, HUD's HOPE VI Revitalization Program successfully transformed severely distressed public housing into revitalized mixed-income communities. By contrast, HUD's Choice Neighborhoods Initiative seeks a more comprehensive approach to neighborhood transformation.
""We make these funds available for communities that are serious about breathing new life into areas that have seen very little public investment over the years,"" said HUD Assistant Secretary Sandra Henriquez. ""These grants will help provide communities the building blocks they need to take a holistic approach toward transforming these neighborhoods where anyone would be proud to call home.""
Earlier today, HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan awarded $3.6 million in Choice Neighborhoods Planning Grantsto help 13 communities across the country lay the foundation for neighborhood revitalization. The Choice Neighborhoods Implementation Grants made available today are intended to put community planning from the drawing board and put them into action. Choice Neighborhoods is focused on three core goals:
Housing: Transform distressed public and assisted housing into energy efficient, mixed-income housing that is physically and financially viable over the long-term; People: Support positive outcomes for families who live in the target development(s) and the surrounding neighborhood, particularly outcomes related to residents' health, safety, employment, mobility, and education; and Neighborhood: Transform neighborhoods of poverty into viable, mixed-income neighborhoods with access to well-functioning services, high quality public schools and education programs, high quality early learning programs and services, public assets, public transportation, and improved access to jobs.
• Housing: Transform distressed public and assisted housing into energy efficient, mixed-income housing that is physically and financially viable over the long-term;
• People: Support positive outcomes for families who live in the target development(s) and the surrounding neighborhood, particularly outcomes related to residents' health, safety, employment, mobility, and education; and
• Neighborhood: Transform neighborhoods of poverty into viable, mixed-income neighborhoods with access to well-functioning services, high quality public schools and education programs, high quality early learning programs and services, public assets, public transportation, and improved access to jobs.
To achieve these core goals, communities must have in place a comprehensive neighborhood revitalization strategy, or Transformation Plan. This Transformation Plan is the guiding document for the revitalization of the public and/or assisted housing units, while simultaneously directing the transformation of the surrounding neighborhood and positive outcomes for families.
Choice Neighborhoods Implementation grants are available for public housing authorities, local governments, nonprofit organizations, tribal entities, and for profit developers that apply jointly with a public entity to extend neighborhood transformation efforts beyond public and/or assisted housing. The program helps communities transform neighborhoods by revitalizing severely distressed public and/or HUD-assisted multi-family housing and investing and leveraging investments in well-functioning services, high quality public schools and education programs, high quality early learning programs and services, public assets, public transportation, and improved access to jobs.
Last August, HUD awarded its first-ever Choice Neighborhoods Implementation grants, a combined $122 million, to stimulate neighborhood revitalization in Boston, Chicago, New Orleans, San Francisco and Seattle.
Choice Neighborhoods links housing improvements with a wider variety of public services including schools, public transit and employment opportunities. The program also widens the traditional pool of eligible applicants by allowing local governments, nonprofits and for-profit developers that submit joint applications with a public entity.
Choice Neighborhoods is a centerpiece of the Obama Administration's interagency Neighborhood Revitalization Initiative, a partnership between HUD and the Departments of Education, Justice, Treasury and Health and Human Services. With support from the White House Domestic Policy Council and White House Office of Urban Affairs, the interagency partnership supports local solutions for sustainable, mixed-income neighborhoods with the affordable housing, safe streets and good schools all families need.
Applicants have until April 10, 2012 to apply for FY 2012 Choice Neighborhoods Implementation grants. HUD anticipates awarding four to five grants with a maximum award of $30,000,000 each in December 2012. Applicants must submit their applications electronically through www.grants.gov."
01/18/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-007.cfm,HUD Expands Job and Contracting Opportunities for Low-Income Individuals and the Businesses that Hire Them,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced that it is launching a Section 3 Business Registry pilot program in Washington, D.C. that will expand job opportunities for low-income people and public housing residents by maintaining a registry of businesses that currently hire them. Additionally, HUD will implement the pilot program in New Orleans, Detroit, Los Angeles and Miami, to give contracting agencies and low-income residents a single source of information to find eligible Section 3 businesses and job opportunities.
Section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 promotes employment, training, and contracting opportunities to low-income residents who live in communities where HUD funds are spent. As a result, Section 3 promotes self-sufficiency for low-income persons, fosters the creation of small businesses, and helps build strong local economies. Based on the data received so far, 2010 HUD investments led to 38,000 new jobs- of which 47% were Section 3 hires. Almost 4,000 Section 3 business concerns received over $475 million in contracts. These numbers will increase as reporting continues.
Under the pilot, HUD's Section 3 Business Registry will offer a searchable online database that housing authorities, local government agencies, and contractors can use to identify firms that have self-certified their status as Section 3 businesses and that hire low-income individuals.
""This business registry will maximize the impact of HUD investments on jobs and contracting opportunities,"" said John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""It's a win-win situation for D.C. residents who arelooking for training and job opportunities as well as for businesses that hire them.""
Since 2009, HUD has increased Section 3 reporting from 20% to 80% of eligible HUD recipients. HUD has supported recipients by providing technical assistance and training in Section 3 compliance and conducted a listening session of stakeholders from various sectors to hear ideas for improvement. Recent HUD funding enabled 12 local recipients (public housing authorities, states, counties, and cities) to hire full-time Section 3 coordinators.
In 2010, 331 new jobs were created HUD-funding recipients in the Washington, DC metropolitan area, 275 (83%) of which were provided to local low-income residents (i.e., Section 3 residents). Additionally, more than $55 million in HUD funding was used for construction projects throughout the Capital Region, approximately $8 million of these funds were awarded to local businesses that hire low-income residents.
Recently, the District of Columbia passed a historic Jobs Bill that will require 51% of new employment opportunities created with local funding to be provided to DC residents. This bill is closely related to Section 3, and HUD plans to work closely with the District government to ensure that the maximum amount of jobs and contracting opportunities are provided to local residents with the greatest economic needs.
The Section 3 Business Registry's online database is also intended to make compliance easier for recipients. It will increase the visibility of Section 3 firms and afford them better access to contracting opportunities. In addition, Section 3 residents will be encouraged to use the Section 3 Business Registry to identify businesses that may have employment opportunities they can apply for.
The Section 3 business registry pilot program will run until the fall of 2012. For more information about or to search HUD's new Section 3 Business Registry, go to www.hud.gov/Sec3biz."
01/18/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-008.cfm,HUD Awards $6.8 Million to Help Local Communities Understand the Scale of Homelessness in Their Areas,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today awarded $6.8 million to help local communities across this country to assess the nature and scope of their homeless challenge as part of a broader Administration goal of preventing and ending homelessness. The technical assistance grants awarded today will ultimately help state and local planning organizations or 'continuums of care' to improve data collection and reporting that is a critical part of designing their responses to homelessness.
""You can't solve homelessness unless you understand homelessness,"" said Mercedes Márquez, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development. ""These grants will offer critical assistance to state and local planners as they gather the necessary data they'll need to prevent and end homelessness as we know it.""
The grants announced today are provided through HUD's Homeless Management Information Systems Technical Assistance Program. The purpose of these technical assistance grants is to provide the highest level of performance among continuums of care in the collection and reporting of homelessness data. HUD is awarding grants to the following technical assistance providers:
Next week, tens of thousands of volunteers across the U.S. will conduct one-night counts of homeless persons and families living in shelters and on the streets. These point-in-time snapshot counts, along with annual data collected through local Homeless Management Information Systems (HMIS), provide a clear and continually improving picture of homelessness throughout the country and at the state and local level. The grant funding announced today will support this effort and Opening Doors (www.usich.gov/opening_doors/), the Obama Administration's strategic plan to prevent and end homelessness.
Homeless Management Information Systems (HMIS) are used by state and local planners to understand the dynamic nature of homelessness in their communities and to assess what programs are working. Local ""continuums"" that require help in their data collection and reporting system will request technical assistance from HUD. The technical assistance offered by the providers awarded funding today will help these planners better understand their homeless population and design the most effective system of care."
01/20/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-010.cfm,FHA Announces Additional Steps to Limit Risk and Strengthen Finances,"WASHINGTON - Today, Acting Federal Housing Administration (FHA) Commissioner Carol J. Galante announced the latest in a series of steps to protect and strengthen the FHA's Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund, while enabling the agency to continue to fulfill its mission to provide access to homeownership for qualified borrowers.
These new regulations strengthen the process by which FHA requires certain lenders to indemnify the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for insurance claims paid on mortgages that are found not to meet the agency's guidelines. In addition, the final rule requires all lenders with the authority to insure mortgages on HUD's behalf (""Lender Insurance"" mortgagee) to meet stricter performance standards to gain and maintain their approval status. More than 80 percent of all FHA forward mortgage loans are insured by Lender Insurance lenders.
""Taken together, the changes announced today will protect FHA's insurance fund from unnecessary and inappropriate risks while offering clear guidance to lenders regarding HUD's underwriting expectations,"" said Acting Commissioner Galante. ""FHA must continue to strike a balance between managing risks to its insurance funds and ensuring that FHA products are offered as widely as possible to qualified borrowers. We hope that the added clarity and certainty provided through these rules will enable lenders to extend financing opportunities to larger numbers of American families as the nation's housing market and economy continue to recover.""
For those loans insured by Lender Insurance lenders, HUD may require indemnification for 'serious and material' violations of FHA origination requirements and for fraud and misrepresentation such that the mortgage never should have been endorsed by the lender. Additionally, the regulation changes the basis under which lenders qualify for Lender Insurance authority.
A Lender Insurance mortgagee must demonstrate a two-year seriously delinquent and claim rate at or below 150 percent of the aggregate rate for the states in which the lender does business. Further, FHA will also monitor lender performance on an ongoing basis to ensure that participating lenders continue to meet the program's eligibility standards. Finally, the regulation establishes a process by which new HUD-approved lenders created through corporate mergers, acquisitions or reorganizations may be considered for Lender Insurance authority.
In a separate Federal Register notice to be published soon, the FHA will propose to reduce the maximum allowable seller concession from its current level to one more in line with industry norms. The current level exposes the FHA to excess risk by creating incentives to inflate appraised value. The revised proposal reflects public comments received on an earlier proposal published in a Federal Register notice on July, 15, 2010. The revised proposal calls for a 30 day comment period. Following an analysis of the public comments received, a final rule will be issued.
Details of the changes announced today are available on the HUD website and will soon be published in the Federal Register as a final rule."
01/20/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-011.cfm,HUD Provides $400 Million to Help Communities in Eight States to Recover from 2011 Disasters,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Shaun Donovan today allocated $400 million in emergency aid to help communities in eight states to recover from presidentially declared natural disasters in 2011. Provided through HUD's Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program, these grants will support long-term disaster recovery efforts in areas with the greatest extent of 'unmet need.'
""Last year, I personally saw the extent of the destruction left behind by several of these disasters, the hardship these communities are feeling, and the work that lies ahead,"" said Donovan. ""These funds will supplement other forms of disaster assistance to put these states and local areas on the path toward long-term recovery.""
On November 18, 2011, Congress appropriated $300 million in CDBG funds to support long-term disaster recovery in the most impacted and distressed areas resulting from a major disaster in 2011 (Public Law 112-55). Concurrently, Congress gave HUD the authority to allocate up to an additional $100 million for the recovery efforts. Secretary Shaun Donovan exercised HUD's full authority by targeting the maximum amount of CDBG funding allowed toward helping these most impacted state and local areas.
These funds are intended to confront unmet housing, business and infrastructure needs beyond those addressed by other forms of public and private assistance. Using a combination of federal data from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Small Business Administration (SBA), HUD identified those states and local communities most impacted and requiring the greatest assistance to recover due to the devastating tornadoes in the Southeast and Missouri; the remnants of Hurricanes Irene and Lee in the Northeast and New England; severe flooding in parts of North Dakota; and destructive wildfires in Texas. As a result of HUD's analysis of disaster data, Donovan made the following allocations within the following states:
New York - $93,213,963 The State of New York will receive $71,654,116 and will target at least 80 percent of these funds to assist Schoharie, Tioga, Broome, Greene, and/or Orange Counties in recovering from the extensive flooding from Hurricane Irene and the remnants of Tropical Storm Lee. In addition, Orange County will receive $11,422,029 and Union Township will receive $10,137,818 directly from HUD to support recovery efforts.
North Dakota - $79,358,648 The State of North Dakota will receive $11,782,684. The state will direct at least 80 percent of this grant to help Ward County to recover from severe flooding. In addition, HUD is providing $67,575,964 directly to the City of Minot which was especially hard hit by the flooding and had the greatest extent of unmet needs in the state.
Alabama - $55,566,078 HUD will allocate $24,697,966 to the State of Alabama to support long-term disaster recovery, at least 80 percent of which will be targeted to Tuscaloosa, Marion, Jefferson and/or DeKalb Counties. HUD will also directly provide $16,634,702 to City of Tuscaloosa; $7,847,084 to Jefferson County; and $6,386,326 to the City of Birmingham to recover from last April's severe storms, tornadoes, straight-line winds and flooding.
Missouri - $53,985,768 The State of Missouri will receive $8,719,059, at least 80 percent of which will support long-term recovery activities in Jasper County following last spring's severe storms, tornadoes and flooding. In addition, the City of Joplin will receive $45,266,709 directly from HUD to support its efforts to recover from last year's devastating tornado.
Pennsylvania - $49,297,140 HUD is allocating $27,142,501 to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, at least 80 percent of which will be directed to Bradford, Dauphin, Columbia, Wyoming, and/or Luzerne Counties which had significant damage following Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee. In addition, Luzerne County will receive $15,738,806 and Dauphin County will receive $6,415,833 directly from HUD.
Texas - $31,319,686 The State of Texas will receive $31,319,686 and will target at least 80 percent of this assistance to Bastrop County which suffered the greatest extent of damage and destruction from a series of wildfires that occurred from late summer through the autumn.
Vermont - $21,660,211 HUD is allocating $21,660,211 to the State of Vermont which will target at least 80 percent of these funds in Washington and Windsor Counties which saw the greatest degree of damage, primarily flooding, from Tropical Storm Irene.
New Jersey - $15,598,506 The State of New Jersey will receive $15,598,506, at least 80 percent of which will assist Passaic County to recover from the severe impacts of Hurricane Irene.
Before these grants can be obligated, grantees will submit an action plan to HUD identifying the proposed use of all funds and how their use will address long-term recovery. All State and local grantees must also certify that they have the capacity to adequately manage these funds in a timely and compliant manner. CDBG disaster recovery funds cannot be used to reimburse costs for which funds are made available by FEMA or the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers."
01/25/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-012.cfm,"HUD, Mayor Bing Announce ""Transition Plan"" to Return Detroit Housing Commission to Local Control","DETROIT - U.S. Housing and Urban Development Assistant Secretary Sandra B. Henriquez today joined Detroit Mayor Dave Bing to announce a transition plan to return the Detroit Housing Commission to local control. HUD assumed control of the agency in 2005.
""The Detroit Housing Commission made significant progress since 2005 and we believe it's time to begin the process to return it to local control,"" said Henriquez. ""We want to ensure we're giving Mayor Bing, and this city, an agency that is solvent and able to meet the needs of Detroit families.""
""With this transition, Detroit once again takes control of our destiny,"" said Bing. ""In the spirit of collaboration with HUD, the City of Detroit is taking a significant step towards returning the Detroit Housing Commission to local governance.""
After a tour of new public housing units at Emerald Springs public housing development, formerly Charles Terrace, Henriquez announced the DHC Transition Plan, which lays out the plan for transition back to local control.
The objectives of the plan are:
Sustainable Governance: The city to finalize DHC Board appointments, ensuring they are consistent with applicable law and requirements. Appointed board will also have to complete training and certification prior to completion of transition. Sustainable Performance: The city, HUD and DHC to execute an Oversight Agreement to address monitoring and oversight and outline actions that need to be taken to ensure progress and performance can be maintained into the future.

• Sustainable Performance: The city, HUD and DHC to execute an Oversight Agreement to address monitoring and oversight and outline actions that need to be taken to ensure progress and performance can be maintained into the future.
During the period of Transition, the mayoral appointed board will serve in an advisory capacity with HUD remaining in control of the commission's assets, including properties, and programs.
HUD assumed control of DHC in 2005, citing serious administrative, financial and management shortfalls. Both the city and HUD agreed the agency had been troubled for more than a decade and required extraordinary attention to improve the quality of life for Detroit's public housing and Housing Choice Voucher residents. HUD entered into a Cooperative Endeavor Agreement with the city to begin improving the Commission's management and financial operations.
As operations improved, HUD determined the agency was ready for stable leadership and in January 2008, selected Eugene Jones to lead DHC's day-to-day operations, with HUD maintaining control through a HUD-appointed representative serving as Board of Commissioners. From the beginning, HUD took aggressive steps to spur development of DHC's three HOPE VI grants, which languished for years because of numerous management changes at the Commission. Today, all three grants are underway, including Jeffries Homes and Parkside Homes. Through HUD's receivership, DHC has made significant progress in redeveloping both low-income and affordable housing in the city.
The site of the announcement today, Emerald Springs, will have more than 200 public and affordable housing units, and 83 new market rate units when completed. The community will also have a new community center, where residents can hold meetings and educational and employment services. Development is expected to be completed 2014. The DHC leveraged nearly $35 million in both public and private funding to construct the new community.
Detroit is also one of seven cities selected for the HUD pilot program Strong Cities, Strong Communities. This White House-led, interagency program focuses on retooling and rebuilding the capacity of cities facing long-term economic challenges"
01/25/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-013.cfm,HUD Charges Massachusetts Apartment Building Owner with Discriminating Against Families with Children,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is charging the owner of a 24-unit apartment building in Holyoke, Massachusetts, with housing discrimination for denying units to families that have children. HUD's charge alleges that Nilma Fichera, who owns and manages New York-based N.A.G. Realty, LLC, violated the Fair Housing Act when she refused to show or rent apartments to families with children because she could not certify that the building was free of lead-based paint.
HUD guidance on the investigation of Fair Housing Act and in its lead regulations (www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-1999-09-15/pdf/99-23016.pdf#page=19) makes clear that while property owners may tell families about housing units that have not been remediated for lead paint, the presence of lead-based paint cannot be used as a reason to refuse to rent.
""Laws to make apartment buildings lead free should not be used as an excuse to make them child-free,"" said John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will continue to enforce the law to ensure that landlords uphold fair housing principles.""
According to HUD's charge, Fichera posted an ad on Craigslist for a three-bedroom apartment. In response to the ad, the Housing Discrimination Project, a non-profit organization located in Holyoke, Massachusetts, that promotes fair housing, arranged for testers to call the number listed in the ad. In a phone conversation with one tester who said she had a five-year-old and a six-year-old, Fichera allegedly said, ""This apartment does not have a lead certificate and the law says I can't rent to anyone with children under five.""
HUD's charge further claims that Fichera refused to show a unit to another tester with a two-year-old son, because the unit did not have a lead certificate.
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, she may award damages to aggrieved persons for the damages caused them by the discrimination.
The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief to deter further discrimination, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose fines in order to vindicate the public interest. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages to aggrieved persons.
FHEO and its partners in the Fair Housing Assistance Program investigate approximately 10,000 housing discrimination complaints annually. People who believe they are the victims of housing discrimination should contact HUD at 1-800-669-9777 (voice), (800) 927-9275 (TTY)."
01/30/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-014.cfm,HUD Secretary Donovan Announces New Regulations to Ensure Equal Access to Housing for All Americans Regardless of Sexual Orientation or Gender Identity,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Shaun Donovan announced today new regulations intended to ensure that HUD's core housing programs are open to all eligible persons, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. Donovan previewed the announcement at the 24th National Conference on Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) Equality - Creating Change. View the final rule here.
""The Obama Administration has viewed the fight for equality on behalf of the LGBT community as a priority and I'm proud that HUD has been a leader in that fight,"" said Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""With this historic rule, the Administration is saying you cannot use taxpayer dollars to prevent Americans from choosing where they want live on the basis sexual orientation or gender identity - ensuring that HUD's housing programs are open, not to some, not to most, but to all.""
The new regulations, published as final in the Federal Register next week, will go into effect 30 days after the rule is published.
U.S. Congressman Barney Frank (D-Mass.) also expressed support for the publishing of final LGBT housing guidelines, ""I am grateful to the Obama administration for instituting this important policy.""
The final rule, published as Equal Access to Housing in HUD Programs - Regardless of Sexual Orientation or Gender Identity, makes the following provisions:
Requires owners and operators of HUD-assisted housing, or housing whose financing is insured by HUD, to make housing available without regard to the sexual orientation or gender identity of an applicant for, or occupant of, the dwelling, whether renter- or owner-occupied. HUD will institute this policy in its rental assistance and homeownership programs, which include the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) mortgage insurance programs, community development programs, and public and assisted housing programs. Prohibits lenders from using sexual orientation or gender identity as a basis to determine a borrower's eligibility for FHA-insured mortgage financing. FHA's current regulations provide that a mortgage lender's determination of the adequacy of a borrower's income ""shall be made in a uniform manner without regard to"" specified prohibited grounds. The rule will add actual or perceived sexual orientation and gender identity to the prohibited grounds to ensure FHA-approved lenders do not deny or otherwise alter the terms of mortgages on the basis of irrelevant criteria. Clarifies that all otherwise eligible families, regardless of marital status, sexual orientation, or gender identity, will have the opportunity to participate in HUD programs. In the majority of HUD's rental and homeownership programs the term ""family"" already has a broad scope, and includes a single person and families with or without children. HUD's rule clarifies that otherwise eligible families may not be excluded because one or more members of the family may be an LGBT individual, have an LGBT relationship, or be perceived to be such an individual or in such relationship. Prohibits owners and operators of HUD-assisted housing or housing insured by HUD from asking about an applicant or occupant's sexual orientation and gender identity for the purpose of determining eligibility or otherwise making housing available. In response to comments on the proposed rule, HUD has clarified this final rule to state that this provision does not prohibit voluntary and anonymous reporting of sexual orientation or gender identity pursuant to state, local, or federal data collection requirements.

Other actions HUD has taken for LGBT Americans include:
HUD conducted the first-ever national study of discrimination against members of the LGBT community in the rental and sale of housing. Every ten years, HUD does a study of the impact of housing discrimination on the basis of race and color. HUD undertook this important research in 1977, 1989 and 2000 and is currently undertaking this study again. It is believed that LGBT individuals and families may remain silent because in many local jurisdictions, they may have little or no legal recourse. While there are no national assessments of LGBT housing discrimination, there are state and local studies that have shown evidence of this sort of bias. For example, a 2007 report by Michigan's Fair Housing Centers (www.fhcmichigan.org/images/Arcus_web1.pdf) found that nearly 30 percent of same-sex couples were treated differently when attempting to buy or rent a home. HUD currently requires its recipients of discretionary funds to comply with local and state non-discrimination laws that cover sexual orientation or gender identity. In 2011 HUD issued new guidance that treats discrimination based on gender nonconformity or sex stereotyping as sex discrimination under the Fair Housing Act, and instructs HUD staff to inform individuals filing complaints about state and local agencies that have LGBT-inclusive nondiscrimination laws. The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in rental, sales and lending on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, disability and familial status. Approximately 20 states, and the District of Columbia, and more than 150 cities, towns and counties across the nation have additional protections that specifically prohibit such discrimination against LGBT individuals. Under the guidance issued in June 2010, HUD will, as appropriate, retain its jurisdiction over complaints filed by LGBT individuals or families but also jointly investigate or refer matters to those state, district and local governments with other legal protections. HUD, HHS and the National Center for Lesbian Rights (NCLR) hosted the first ever federal government summit addressing issues for LGBT seniors in December 2011.

01/31/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-015.cfm,HUD Awards $20 Million in Technical Assistance to Help Local Communities Stabilize Neighborhoods Hard-Hit by Foreclosure,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today awarded $20 million in technical assistance funding to 12 organizations that will, in turn, help local communities across this country stabilize neighborhoods hard-hit by foreclosure through HUD's Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP).
""This assistance can make all the difference for communities struggling against abandonment and blight,"" said Mercedes Márquez, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development. ""The funds we award today will offer critical assistance to NSP grantees as they work to target their funds in a way that has the greatest impact at the neighborhood level.""
The funding agreements announced today are provided through HUD's Neighborhood Stabilization Program Technical Assistance and Capacity Building Program, as part of the NSP3 allocation, authorized under Dodd-Frank, and is continuation of the technical assistance provided under NSP2, authorized under ARRA. The purpose of this technical assistance is to provide the highest level of performance among NSP grantees. HUD is making the following technical assistance awards:
NSP technical assistance and capacity building is an assessment-based and outcome-focused delivery system. Its key objectives are to improve grantees' ability to: (1) assess conditions in the affordable segment of their local housing market; (2) design and appropriately implement neighborhood stabilization programs based upon an accurate assessment of the affordable segment of their local housing market; (3) increase organizational capacity to leverage private and public dollars; (4) understand and comply with statutory and regulatory requirements; and (5) impact vacancy rates in target areas. These awards allow HUD to deploy experts, based on grantee need, to achieve these objectives.
The funds awarded today are part of Office of Community Planning and Development's new OneCPD Integrated Practitioner Assistance System. OneCPD represents a fundamental change in the way HUD's traditional program-specific technical assistance has been structured and delivered over the years. This approach is intended to build the kind of grantee management systems and capacity necessary to successfully carry out comprehensive and sustainable place-based development and revitalization strategies.
OneCPD allow allows grantees to tell their story of accomplishment by measuring not only the outputs of this technical and capacity building assistance but the outcomes and the impact on their communities as well. The technical and capacity building assistance awards announced today are provided through the Department's Office of Community Planning and Development (CPD)."
01/31/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-016.cfm,Temporary Disaster Program for Victims of Hurricanes Ike & Gustav Ends Today - Remaining Families Given More Time to Transition,"WASHINGTON - A rental assistance program that temporarily housed nearly 20,000 families who were displaced by Hurricanes Ike and Gustav in 2008 officially ends today with only 3,500 households still enrolled in the program. To help these families find permanent housing solutions, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) will provide $28 million to convert eligible families to its Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program.
Since these two powerful hurricanes struck nearly five years ago, the Disaster Housing Assistance Program Ike (DHAP- Ike) assisted approximately 17,500 families in the Gulf Coast region, primarily in Texas and Southeastern Louisiana. Originally designed as a 17-month temporary assistance program, DHAP-Ike, HUD and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) extended the program several times to give families an opportunity to find stable housing. The program was administered by public housing authorities and thousands of private landlords.
""Over these past five years, we've worked to help tens of thousands of families get back on their feet and we are committed to helping the families remaining in the Disaster Housing Assistance Program make that transition too,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""I'm pleased Congress answered HUD's call for more funding to help these last remaining families find a permanent place they can finally call home.""
Since last September, HUD and local public housing authorities worked to inform the remaining 3,500 families of the conclusion of DHAP-Ike and to encourage them to apply for HUD's Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program. To provide additional time for families to make this transition, HUD and FEMAwill provide interim rental payments on behalf of DHAP-Ike families deemed eligible for the HCV for up to up to two months, from February 1, 2012, through March 31, 2012.
Families must meet income eligibility requirements to convert to the HCV program, which allows families to generally pay not more than 30 percent of their income for rent.
President Obama's 2012 budget requested additional funding specifically directed to allow HUD to support vouchers for families affected by Hurricanes Ike and Gustav. The Administration worked with Congress through the 2012 appropriations process to provide the funding necessary to transition the remaining families to more permanent accommodations."

02/03/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-019.cfm,HUD Announces Additional $31.5 Million to Fund Housing for Very Low-Income Seniors,"WASHINGTON - Hundreds of very low-income senior citizens will have access to affordable supportive housing thanks to $31.5 million in housing assistance announced today by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The funding announced today (see attached list) will help non-profit organizations in five states produce additional accessible housing, offer rental assistance, and facilitate supportive services for the elderly. Read a detailed summary of each grant.
The capital advances and rental subsidies are provided through HUD's Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly. Last November, HUD announced $545 million in Section 202 grants nationwide to 97 grantees in 31 States and Puerto Rico. In addition to funding the construction, acquisition, and rehabilitation of multifamily developments, HUD's Section 202 program also provides million of dollars in rental assistance so that residents in selected developments only pay 30 percent of their adjusted incomes.
""The Obama Administration is committed to helping our senior citizens find an affordable place to live that is close to needed healthcare services and transportation,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""These grants and continued rental subsidies will help provide critically needed housing to some of our most vulnerable citizens.""
Section 202 grants provide very low-income elderly persons 62 years of age or older with the opportunity to live independently in an environment that provides support services to meet their unique needs. HUD provides these funds to non-profit organizations in two forms:
Capital Advances. This is funding that covers the cost of developing, acquiring, or rehabilitating the development. Repayment is not required as long as the housing remains available for occupancy by very low-income elderly persons for at least 40 years. Project Rental Assistance Contracts. This is funding that goes to each development to cover the difference between the residents' contributions toward rent and the cost of operating the project.
• Capital Advances. This is funding that covers the cost of developing, acquiring, or rehabilitating the development. Repayment is not required as long as the housing remains available for occupancy by very low-income elderly persons for at least 40 years.
• Project Rental Assistance Contracts. This is funding that goes to each development to cover the difference between the residents' contributions toward rent and the cost of operating the project.
Residents must be ""very low income"" with household incomes less than 50 percent of their median for that area. However, most households that receive Section 202 assistance earn less than 30 percent of the median for their area. Generally, this means that a one-person household will have an annual income of about $13,500."
02/06/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-021.cfm,Obama Administration Releases January Housing Scorecard,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of the Treasury today released the January edition of the Obama Administration's Housing Scorecard - a comprehensive report on the nation's housing market. Data in the January Housing Scorecard underscore fragility as the overall outlook remains mixed. Inventories of existing homes for sale and the overhang of homes held off market improved over the last two quarters and foreclosure starts continued to fall in December. However, data on new home sales and home prices offered mixed signals, while foreclosure completions ticked upward. The full report is available online at www.hud.gov/scorecard.
""While we should be encouraged by the positive trends on inventories and foreclosure starts, the mixed overall outlook means that we must remain diligent to improve conditions in the nation's housing market,"" said HUD Assistant Secretary Raphael Bostic. ""Responsible homeowners shouldn't have to sit and wait for the housing market to hit bottom to get some relief. That's why the Administration's recent proposals are critical to promoting healing in the market. Our efforts to ramp up economic development in fragile neighborhoods and to expand homeowner access to low-interest refinance options reflect our commitment to turning these markets towards growth.""
""The Administration's programs continue to offer real relief for homeowners while setting standards that have led to more sustainable assistance to prevent foreclosures,"" said Treasury Assistant Secretary for Financial Stability Tim Massad. ""The recent enhancements we have announced will bring further assistance to homeowners, renters and their communities as our nation continues to heal from an unprecedented housing crisis.""
On January 27, the Obama Administration announced important enhancements (www.treasury.gov/connect/blog/Pages/Expanding-our-efforts-to-help-more-homeowners-and-strengthen-hard-hit-communities.aspx) to the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) to extend the reach of the program, broaden the pool of eligible homeowners, protect tenants at risk of displacement due to foreclosure and provide more robust relief to underwater homeowners who participate in the program. And just last week, the President unveiled a broad plan to provide responsible borrowers an opportunity to refinance (www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2012/02/01/president-obama-talks-about-ways-help-homeowners), implement a Homeowner's Bill of Rights, and begin to transition foreclosed properties into rental housing, helping to stabilize neighborhoods and improve home prices.
The January Housing Scorecard features key data on the health of the housing market and the impact of the Administration's foreclosure prevention programs, including:
Market data show progress on housing overhang, but continued fragility in home prices and sales. Inventories of existing homes for sale have continued to improve over the last two quarters, declining from 3.2 million in the second quarter to 2.4 million in the fourth quarter. Housing units held off the market have also fallen, from 3.9 million in the first quarter to 3.6 million in the fourth quarter. Existing home sales continued to increase this month, while new home sales declined. In addition, foreclosure starts continued to fall in December, though foreclosure completions ticked upward. The Administration's recovery efforts continue to help millions of families deal with the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. More than 5.6 million modification arrangements were started between April 2009 and the end of December 2011 - including more than 1.7 million HAMP trial modification starts and nearly 1.2 million FHA loss mitigation and early delinquency interventions. More than 930,000 homeowners have received a HAMP permanent modification to date, saving an estimated $10.5 billion in monthly mortgage payments. The Administration's programs continue to encourage improved standards and processes in the industry, with HOPE Now lenders offering families and individuals more than 2.6 million proprietary mortgage modifications through December. Eligible homeowners entering HAMP have a high likelihood of earning a permanent modification and realizing long-term success. Eighty-four percent of homeowners entering HAMP in the past 18 months received a permanent modification, with an average trial period of 3.5 months. Quarterly re-default data shows that HAMP modifications are sustainable for the majority of homeowners. After six months in the program, more than 94 percent of homeowners remain in their permanent modification. HAMP modifications continue to show lower re-default rates than industry modifications.

Existing home sales continued to increase this month, while new home sales declined. In addition, foreclosure starts continued to fall in December, though foreclosure completions ticked upward.
• The Administration's recovery efforts continue to help millions of families deal with the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. More than 5.6 million modification arrangements were started between April 2009 and the end of December 2011 - including more than 1.7 million HAMP trial modification starts and nearly 1.2 million FHA loss mitigation and early delinquency interventions. More than 930,000 homeowners have received a HAMP permanent modification to date, saving an estimated $10.5 billion in monthly mortgage payments. The Administration's programs continue to encourage improved standards and processes in the industry, with HOPE Now lenders offering families and individuals more than 2.6 million proprietary mortgage modifications through December.
• Eligible homeowners entering HAMP have a high likelihood of earning a permanent modification and realizing long-term success. Eighty-four percent of homeowners entering HAMP in the past 18 months received a permanent modification, with an average trial period of 3.5 months. Quarterly re-default data shows that HAMP modifications are sustainable for the majority of homeowners. After six months in the program, more than 94 percent of homeowners remain in their permanent modification. HAMP modifications continue to show lower re-default rates than industry modifications.

Also featured this month is the Administration's Housing Scorecard Regional Spotlight on market strength in Tampa, Florida and surrounding communities. The Tampa metro area was one of the hardest hit areas in the nation following the housing market downturn and an area where the Administration's broad approach to stabilizing the housing market has been very active.
""The mixed signals that the national data show for the broader housing market clearly represent the situation in Tampa,"" said HUD Assistant Secretary Raphael Bostic. ""The Administration is working hard to help all homeowners who have been hit hard during the crisis and, as this Regional Spotlight shows, our efforts have helped more than 64,000 families in Tampa avoid foreclosure. But we have much more to do to reach the many households who still face trouble and to help the Tampa market recover.""
The bi-monthly Housing Scorecard Regional Spotlight features data on the health of the Tampa housing market and impact of efforts to help homeowners at the local level including:
The Tampa market is under pressure from a high percentage of distressed mortgages, deeply discounted foreclosed properties, low property values, and many severely underwater mortgages. Although the share of distressed mortgages in and around Tampa - those 90 or more days delinquent, in foreclosure, or bank owned - has been above the national average since mid-2000, the local foreclosure crisis has generally mirrored that of the nation as a whole, with a significant rise in delinquencies and defaults among high-cost subprime loans beginning in 2007. Moreover, Florida has the third longest average foreclosure processing time among states, as lender processing delays and a backlog in the courts contribute to a high share of mortgages remaining in the foreclosure pipeline. An estimated 64,000 Tampa households have received mortgage modifications, many directly through Administration programs. Since April 1, 2009 approximately 64,000 mortgage assistance interventions have been offered to homeowners in the Tampa metropolitan area. More than 37,000 interventions were offered through HAMP and the FHA loss mitigation and early delinquency intervention programs. An estimated additional 27,000 proprietary modifications have been offered through HOPE Now Alliance servicers. While some homeowners may have received help from more than one program, more assistance has been offered than foreclosures completed during this period (25,300). The Administration's Hardest Hit Fund and Neighborhood Stabilization Programs have fueled local foreclosure prevention efforts and market stability. Florida has received more than $1 billion through the Hardest Hit Fund to implement local solutions to borrower mortgage defaults and address the range of factors that contribute to a family's financial problems. Moreover, approximately $187 million has been awarded to nine jurisdictions through the Neighborhood Stabilization Program to help purchase or redevelop residential properties and address the effects of abandoned and foreclosed housing. Both programs have helped provide stability to the Tampa housing market.

02/08/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-022.cfm,HUD Announces More Than $400 Million in Indian Housing Block Grants,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today announced $404 million in Indian Housing Block Grant (IHBG) allocations to nearly 300 tribes in 27 states. These funds are distributed each year based on a formula to eligible Indian tribes or their tribally designated housing entities for a range of affordable housing activities. More than $250 million in IHBG funds are still to be allocated among Native American communities this year
IHBG funds are intended to primarily benefit low-income families living on Indian reservations or in other communities. The amount of each grant is based on a formula that considers local needs and housing units under management by the tribe or designated entity.
""These funds are making a real difference in tribal communities each and every day,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""Projects include affordable housing, infrastructure upgrades, community centers and safety programs that every community needs to thrive. These efforts are part of a broader commitment to ensure Native American communities can build their economies in response to their needs and as they see fit.""
Eligible activities for the funds include housing development, assistance to housing developed under the Indian Housing Program, housing services to eligible families and individuals, crime prevention and safety, and model activities that provide creative approaches to solving affordable housing problems. The block grant approach to housing was enabled by the Native American Housing Assistance and Self Determination Act of 1996 (NAHASDA)."
02/09/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/SettlementFeb92012.cfm,Federal Government and State Attorneys General Reach $25 Billion Agreement with Five Largest Mortgage Servicers to Address Mortgage Loan Servicing and Foreclosure Abuses,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Shaun Donovan, Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller and Colorado Attorney General John W. Suthers announced today that the federal government and 49 state attorneys general have reached a landmark $25 billion agreement with the nation's five largest mortgage servicers to address mortgage loan servicing and foreclosure abuses. The agreement provides substantial financial relief to homeowners and establishes significant new homeowner protections for the future.
The unprecedented joint agreement is the largest federal-state civil settlement ever obtained and is the result of extensive investigations by federal agencies, including the Department of Justice, HUD and the HUD Office of the Inspector General (HUD-OIG), and state attorneys general and state banking regulators across the country. The joint federal-state group entered into the agreement with the nation's five largest mortgage servicers: Bank of America Corporation, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Wells Fargo & Company, Citigroup Inc., and Ally Financial Inc. (formerly GMAC).
""This agreement--the largest joint federal-state settlement ever obtained--is the result of unprecedented coordination among enforcement agencies throughout the government,"" said Attorney General Holder."" It holds mortgage servicers accountable for abusive practices and requires them to commit more than $20 billion towards financial relief for consumers. As a result, struggling homeowners throughout the country will benefit from reduced principals and refinancing of their loans. The agreement also requires substantial changes in how servicers do business, which will ensure the abuses of the past are not repeated.""
""This historic settlement will provide immediate relief to homeowners, forcing banks to reduce the principal balance on many loans, refinance loans for underwater borrowers, and pay billions of dollars to states and consumers,"" said HUD Secretary Donovan. ""Banks must follow the laws. Any bank that hasn't done so should be held accountable and should take prompt action to correct its mistakes. And it will not end with this settlement. One of the most important ways this settlement helps homeowners is that it forces the banks to clean up their acts and fix the problems uncovered during our investigations. And it does that by committing them to major reforms in how they service mortgage loans. These new customer service standards are in keeping with the Homeowners Bill of Rights recently announced by President Obama--a single, straightforward set of commonsense rules that families can count on.""
""This monitored agreement holds the banks accountable, it provides badly needed relief to homeowners, and it transforms the mortgage servicing industry so now homeowners will be protected and treated fairly,"" said Iowa Attorney General Miller.
""This settlement has broad bipartisan support from the states because the attorneys general realize that the partnership with the federal agencies made it possible to achieve favorable terms and conditions that would have been difficult for the states or the federal government to achieve on their own,"" said Colorado Attorney General Suthers.
The joint federal-state agreement requires servicers to implement comprehensive new mortgage loan servicing standards and to commit $25 billion to resolve violations of state and federal law. These violations include servicers' use of ""robo-signed"" affidavits in foreclosure proceedings; deceptive practices in the offering of loan modifications; failures to offer non-foreclosure alternatives before foreclosing on borrowers with federally insured mortgages; and filing improper documentation in federal bankruptcy court.
Under the terms of the agreement, the servicers are required to collectively dedicate $20 billion toward various forms of financial relief to borrowers. At least $10 billion will go toward reducing the principal on loans for borrowers who, as of the date of the settlement, are either delinquent or at imminent risk of default and owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth. At least $3 billion will go toward refinancing loans for borrowers who are current on their mortgages but who owe more on their mortgage than their homes are worth. Borrowers who meet basic criteria will be eligible for the refinancing, which will reduce interest rates for borrowers who are currently paying much higher rates or whose adjustable rate mortgages are due to soon rise to much higher rates. Up to $7 billion will go towards other forms of relief, including forbearance of principal for unemployed borrowers, anti-blight programs, short sales and transitional assistance, benefits for service members who are forced to sell their home at a loss as a result of a Permanent Change in Station order, and other programs. Because servicers will receive only partial credit for every dollar spent on some of the required activities, the settlement will provide direct benefits to borrowers in excess of $20 billion.
Mortgage servicers are required to fulfill these obligations within three years. To encourage servicers to provide relief quickly, there are incentives for relief provided within the first 12 months. Servicers must reach 75 percent of their targets within the first two years. Servicers that miss settlement targets and deadlines will be required to pay substantial additional cash amounts.
In addition to the $20 billion in financial relief for borrowers, the agreement requires the servicers to pay $5 billion in cash to the federal and state governments. $1.5 billion of this payment will be used to establish a Borrower Payment Fund to provide cash payments to borrowers whose homes were sold or taken in foreclosure between Jan. 1, 2008 and Dec. 31, 2011, and who meet other criteria. This program is separate from the restitution program currently being administered by federal banking regulators to compensate those who suffered direct financial harm as a result of wrongful servicer conduct. Borrowers will not release any claims in exchange for a payment. The remaining $3.5 billion of the $5 billion payment will go to state and federal governments to be used to repay public funds lost as a result of servicer misconduct and to fund housing counselors, legal aid and other similar public programs determined by the state attorneys general.
The $5 billion includes a $1 billion resolution of a separate investigation into fraudulent and wrongful conduct by Bank of America and various Countrywide entities related to the origination and underwriting of Federal Housing Administration (FHA)-insured mortgage loans, and systematic inflation of appraisal values concerning these loans, from Jan. 1, 2003 through April 30, 2009. Payment of $500 million of this $1 billion will be deferred to partially fund a loan modification program for Countrywide borrowers throughout the nation who are underwater on their mortgages. This investigation was conducted by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York, with the Civil Division's Commercial Litigation Branch of the Department of Justice, HUD and HUD-OIG. The settlement also resolves an investigation by the Eastern District of New York, the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (SIGTARP) and the Federal Housing Finance Agency-Office of the Inspector General (FHFA-OIG) into allegations that Bank of America defrauded the Home Affordable Modification Program.
The joint federal-state agreement requires the mortgage servicers to implement unprecedented changes in how they service mortgage loans, handle foreclosures, and ensure the accuracy of information provided in federal bankruptcy court. The agreement requires new servicing standards which will prevent foreclosure abuses of the past, such as robo-signing, improper documentation and lost paperwork, and create dozens of new consumer protections. The new standards provide for strict oversight of foreclosure processing, including third-party vendors, and new requirements to undertake pre-filing reviews of certain documents filed in bankruptcy court.
The new servicing standards make foreclosure a last resort by requiring servicers to evaluate homeowners for other loss mitigation options first. In addition, banks will be restricted from foreclosing while the homeowner is being considered for a loan modification. The new standards also include procedures and timelines for reviewing loan modification applications and give homeowners the right to appeal denials. Servicers will also be required to create a single point of contact for borrowers seeking information about their loans and maintain adequate staff to handle calls.
The agreement will also provide enhanced protections for service members that go beyond those required by the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA). In addition, the four servicers that had not previously resolved certain portions of potential SCRA liability have agreed to conduct a full review, overseen by the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, to determine whether any servicemembers were foreclosed on in violation of SCRA since Jan. 1, 2006. The servicers have also agreed to conduct a thorough review, overseen by the Civil Rights Division, to determine whether any servicemember, from Jan. 1, 2008, to the present, was charged interest in excess of 6% on their mortgage, after a valid request to lower the interest rate, in violation of the SCRA. Servicers will be required to make payments to any servicemember who was a victim of a wrongful foreclosure or who was wrongfully charged a higher interest rate. This compensation for servicemembers is in addition to the $25 billion settlement amount.
The agreement will be filed as a consent judgment in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Compliance with the agreement will be overseen by an independent monitor, Joseph A. Smith Jr. Smith has served as the North Carolina Commissioner of Banks since 2002. Smith is also the former Chairman of the Conference of State Banks Supervisors (CSBS). The monitor will oversee implementation of the servicing standards required by the agreement; impose penalties of up to $1 million per violation (or up to $5 million for certain repeat violations); and publish regular public reports that identify any quarter in which a servicer fell short of the standards imposed in the settlement.
The agreement resolves certain violations of civil law based on mortgage loan servicing activities. The agreement does not prevent state and federal authorities from pursuing criminal enforcement actions related to this or other conduct by the servicers. The agreement does not prevent the government from punishing wrongful securitization conduct that will be the focus of the new Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities Working Group. The United States also retains its full authority to recover losses and penalties caused to the federal government when a bank failed to satisfy underwriting standards on a government-insured or government-guaranteed loan. The agreement does not prevent any action by individual borrowers who wish to bring their own lawsuits. State attorneys general also preserved, among other things, all claims against the Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems (MERS), and all claims brought by borrowers.
Investigations were conducted by the U.S. Trustee Program of the Department of Justice, HUD-OIG, HUD's FHA, state attorneys general offices and state banking regulators from throughout the country, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Colorado, the Justice Department's Civil Division, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of North Carolina, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of South Carolina, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, SIGTARP and FHFA-OIG. The Department of Treasury, the Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Department of Veterans Affairs and the U.S. Department of Agriculture made critical contributions.

The funds will help local communities learn more about their fair housing rights and housing providers meet their fair housing obligations, including those related to HUD's new Equal Access to Housing regulation."
02/09/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-026.cfm,$1 Billion to Be Paid by the Bank of America to the United States Largest False Claims Act Settlement Relating to Mortgage Fraud,"As part of the global resolution between the United States of America and the five largest mortgage servicing banks in the country, which will bring much needed relief to financially distressed homeowners nationwide, Loretta E. Lynch, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, today announced that the government will also resolve its claims against the Bank of America, Countrywide Financial Corporation and certain Countrywide subsidiaries and affiliates (Countrywide) for underwriting and origination mortgage fraud.
Since 2009, the office has been investigating the Bank of America's lending practices to determine whether the bank, through Countrywide, which the bank acquired in 2008, knowingly made loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) to unqualified home buyers. To date, the FHA has incurred hundreds of millions of dollars in damages as a result of this conduct. The investigation also encompassed allegations that the bank and Countrywide defrauded the FHA insurance fund by originating mortgage loans that were based upon inflated appraisals. During the investigation, the office determined that the bank's conduct provides a basis for affirmative civil enforcement under, among other legal remedies, the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. §§ 3729-33.
As part of the global settlement, Bank of America will pay $1 billion to resolve the wrongdoing uncovered during the office's investigation. The settlement will entail an immediate payment of $500 million to provide a recovery for the harm done to the FHA by Countrywide's conduct. Payment of the second $500 million will be deferred to fund a loan modification program for Countrywide borrowers across the nation with underwater mortgages. Under the terms of the program, Bank of America will solicit all potentially eligible borrowers and provide a loan modification to anyone with an eligible mortgage who accepts the offer. If, after the expiration of three years, the bank has not met its obligation to apply the full $500 million to provide such relief, any remainder will be paid directly to the United States.
""We announce today the largest ever False Claims Act settlement relating to mortgage fraud. Through their underwriting and origination of tens of thousands of government-insured loans to unqualified borrowers, Countrywide Financial subsidiaries systematically abused the Federal Housing Administration and became some of the main players in this country's financial crisis. We are committed to protecting the FHA's ability to provide assistance to qualified low income and first-time home-buyers, and this settlement goes a long way toward that end. It also puts lenders on notice that they will face serious financial consequences for violating their obligations under the FHA's programs,"" stated United States Attorney Lynch.
Ms. Lynch expressed her grateful appreciation for the assistance provided by Shaun Donovan, Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD); Helen Kanovsky, General Counsel for HUD; David Montoya, Inspector General for HUD; and Julie Shaffer, Director of the HUD Philadelphia Home Ownership Center.
""It is fundamental that lending institutions that earn the authority to directly endorse FHA-insured mortgages apply our standards,"" said HUD Secretary Donovan. ""This is the largest false claims act settlement related to mortgage fraud and will not only compensate FHA but will also ensure assistance for homeowners who have been harmed by Countrywide.""
""This agreement is demonstrative, and should serve as a model, of what results can be achieved when agencies of the United States Government join forces in a united effort to combat fraud in the FHA insured mortgage program,"" said Inspector General Montoya. ""OIG staff served IG subpoenas, conducted multiple interviews, reviewed loan files, and worked closely with the U.S. Attorney's office in developing this case."" He further added, ""I am appreciative of the tenacity with which the Assistant United States Attorneys approached this matter, the expertise and effort of my OIG auditors, investigators and legal team, and the assistance of the HUD Office of General Counsel and its Office of Program Enforcement and Philadelphia Home Ownership Center throughout this endeavor.""
The settlement announced today also resolves the office's investigation, conducted with the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program and the Inspector General for the Federal Housing Finance Agency, of allegations that Bank of America defrauded the government by failing to determine the eligibility of homeowners to participate in the government's Home Affordable Modification Program. Ms. Lynch thanked Christy L. Romero, Acting Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, and Steve A. Linick, the Inspector General for the Federal Housing Finance Agency, for their assistance in this investigation.
The Eastern District's investigation was conducted by Assistant United States Attorneys Richard K. Hayes and Kenneth M. Abell, Affirmative Civil Enforcement Auditor Emily Rosenthal, Senior Trial Counsel, Commercial Litigation Branch, United States Department of Justice, William C. Edgar, and Trial Attorney, Commercial Litigation Branch, United States Department of Justice, John Warshawsky.

02/10/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-025.cfm,"HUD Awards Nearly $1.8 Billion to Improve, Preserve Nation's Public Housing Stock","WASHINGTON - U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan awarded today nearly $1.8 billion to public housing authorities in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The funds will allow these agencies to make major large-scale improvements to their public housing units. View funding by public housing authority here.
Today's grants are provided through HUD's Capital Fund Program, which provides annual funding to all public housing authorities to build, repair, renovate and/or modernize the public housing in their communities. This funding can be used to make large-scale improvements such as new roofs and to make energy-efficient upgrades to replace old plumbing and electrical systems.
""This funding will help housing authorities address long-standing capital improvements, but it only scratches the surface in addressing the deep backlog we're seeing across the country,"" said Donovan. ""Today, we are closer to helping housing authorities and our private sector partners undertake their capital needs over the long haul. With the passage of HUD's 2012 budget, Congress gave HUD the go-ahead for a new, comprehensive and critical demonstration tool that we believe will help preserve and enhance America's affordable housing, including public housing.""
In November 2011, Congress gave HUD the approval to test a comprehensive tool to preserve public housing and other HUD-assistant housing. Congress authorized HUD to begin a Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) as part of the Obama Administration's comprehensive strategy to keep these public and other HUD affordable homes on firm financial footing. Public housing authorities need nearly $26 billion to keep these homes safe and decent for families. But given our budget realities, HUD proposed this innovative way to confront the decline of the nation's public and affordable housing stock.
In FY 2012, RAD will enable public housing authorities and owners to continue to make standard life-cycle improvements to their inventory and modernize or replace obsolete units to stem the loss of stock from private sector partners choosing to opt-out of affordable housing programs. The demonstration will bring more than 60,000 units into a reliable, long term, project-based rental assistance contract - and allow public housing authorities to raise more than $6.1 billion in private financing to reduce the large backlog of capital repair needs and in the process, support significant job creation in communities across the country.
Sandra B. Henriquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, added, ""We see Congress' decision to allow this demonstration to begin as a victory, not only for HUD, but for countless communities that desperately want to improve their public housing and other affordable housing, as well as a victory for families who need quality housing they can afford and who want more options on where they might choose to live.""
Last year, HUD released Capital Needs in the Public Housing Program, a study that updated the national estimate of capital needs in the public housing stock in the U.S. The study found the nation's 1.2 million public housing units are facing an estimated $25.6 billion in much-needed large scale repairs. Unlike routine maintenance, capital needs are the large-scale improvements required to make the housing decent and economically sustainable, such as replacing roofs or updating plumbing and electrical systems to increase energy efficiency. This study updates a 1998 analysis and includes costs to address overdue repairs, accessibility improvements for disabled residents, lead abatement, and water and energy conservation that would make the homes more cost effective and energy efficient.
Over the last 75 years, the federal government has invested billions in the development and maintenance of public and multifamily housing - including providing critical support through HUD's Capital Fund, the grants announced today. Still, the nation continues to lose thousands of public housing units annually, primarily due to disrepair. To protect the considerable federal investment and respond to the growing demand for affordable rental housing, the Obama Administration proposed RAD. The details of the demonstration's timeline and application are being prepared and HUD expects to issue a notice for public comment in the coming months.

02/10/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-028.cfm,FHA Announces Pilot Program to Accelerate Financing of Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Projects,"WASHINGTON - The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) today unveiled a new pilot program to test an accelerated approval process for the purchase or refinancing of multi-family rental properties assisted through the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) Program.
In launching this pilot program in Chicago, Detroit, Boston, and Los Angeles, FHA's Office of Multifamily Housing Programs believes it can cut the time needed to review and approve financing applications for LIHTC-assisted transactions from approximately one year to just 90 - 120 days. The Hubs will process LIHTC loans for all of their related program centers.
Reducing the time required to review and approve applications under FHA's Section 223(f) Program helps align FHA-insured financing with the LIHTC Program standards including the need to meet strict time deadlines. Expediting FHA review and approval is needed since failure to meet bond closing or other LIHTC performance deadlines may result in forfeit of the credit allocation or bond reservation and may impair the borrower's ability to secure tax credits for future transactions. Read FHA's Housing Notice for details of this pilot program.
""It has become clear that we need to rethink our process at FHA if we hope to leverage LIHTC to the maximum degree possible,"" said FHA's Acting Commissioner Carol Galante. ""This pilot program will test our ability to significantly cut our review process so we can put people in affordable homes and provide unique financing options for developers.""
Marie Head, HUD's Deputy Assistant Secretary for Multi-family Housing said, ""If we can successfully cut the time it takes to approve these lower risk LIHTC projects in these four cities, we have the potential to dramatically increase the production of affordable rental projects nationwide.""
The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA) required FHA to streamline mortgage insurance applications for projects with equity from the Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program. Last year, FHA endorsed approximately $561 million in firm commitments for LIHTC projects, a 35 percent increase over Fiscal Year 2010. This new pilot should help to increase those numbers even more.
The housing notice published today launches the first phase of the Tax Credit Pilot by providing permanent financing on transactions that are low risk, to allow FHA to significantly streamline the review process and create efficiencies without increasing risk. The first phase of the Pilot will permit applications for permanent financing processed under Section 223(f) for properties that are recently constructed and occupied, for preservation and moderate rehabilitation of properties with Section 8 rental assistance or for older, stabilized tax credit properties through the syndication of new credits."

""As the President made clear in his State of the Union address, this is a make or break moment for the middle class - both for those who are in it and for those who aspire to it,"" said Donovan. ""What's at stake is the survival of the basic American promise - the idea that if you work hard, you can do well enough to raise a family, own a home in a strong, affordable neighborhood, and put a little away for retirement. This budget request reflects the President's vision, but also reflects the reality that robust growth requires tough choices - doing more with less and holding ourselves accountable for results.""
The Administration's overall budget outlines the President's commitment to ensuring every American gets a fair shot, everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same rules. For HUD, that includes:
Giving Hard-Working, Responsible Americans a Fair Shot - by helping responsible homeowners; by maintaining the Department's commitment to core rental assistance programs; and by reducing the number of homeless veterans on our streets; Ensuring Everybody Plays By the Same Rules - by establishing a Homeowner Bill of Rights; and by bringing HUD-assisted housing into the mainstream of real estate finance; Creating New Jobs Here in America to Discourage Outsourcing and Encourage Insourcing - by maintaining funding for job-creating programs like the Community Development Block Grant; and by helping regions reduce the combined cost of housing and transportation to attract private investment and speed economic growth. Reforming the Federal Government So It's Leaner, Smarter, and More Transparent - by streamlining bureaucracy and identifying savings in our largest rental programs; and by making the agency more accountable for results through continued Transformation Initiative investments and the innovative HUDStat performance measurement system.

An economy that meets the needs of the future requires a federal government that is streamlined, transparent and efficient. This budget continues this Administration's work to transform how HUD, and the federal government as a whole, does business so that state and local government, private sector, and individual Americans have a real federal partner accountable for measurable outcomes.
HUD's FY2013 budget includes several proposals to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of HUD programs:
By merging its Public Housing Operating and Capital Fund programs into a single subsidy stream, HUD proposes to reduce the administrative burden on state and local public housing authorities that provide safe and sanitary housing for 1.1 million of the nation's poorest families. This budget request also outlines a proposal to streamline and enhance the Family Self-Sufficiency program. HUD's plan would allow PHAs to connect residents in public housing - as well as those who receive housing choice vouchers - to resources and services to find and retain jobs that lead to economic independence and self-sufficiency. The budget also includes a series of reforms to HUD rental assistance programs that save over $500 million in 2013, without reducing the number of families served - including capping annual increases to Project Based Rental Assistance subsidies; aligning the minimum rent policy across HUD-assisted households; and simplifying how HUD administers deduction for medical expenses.

HUD's FY2013 budget also reflects the need to ensure that America's future isn't built on a mountain of debt. As a down payment toward reducing the deficit, the 2011 Budget Control Act capped discretionary spending for the next ten years, cutting the deficit by $907 billion over 10 years and bringing non-security discretionary spending to the lowest share of the economy since President Eisenhower. HUD's proposed budget achieves substantial results for vulnerable people and distressed communities in the new fiscal environment. The budget:
Maintains housing assistance for all families currently receiving rental subsidies; Serves almost 2.5 million families living in public housing and project-based Section 8 developments (over 60% elderly and disabled); Supports tenant-based vouchers for more than 2.2 million families (over 45% elderly and disabled); Provides 10,000 new vouchers to homeless and funds 5,300 more supportive housing units for the elderly and disabled; Enables FHA and Ginnie Mae to continue crucial, temporary countercyclical role, with 1.2 million single family mortgages expected in 2013 and $239 billion in new GNMA guarantees; Brings private capital back to the market through FHA premium increases and other measures; Assists nearly 5.5 million households, over 82,000 more than at the end of fiscal year 2011; and Creates or retains 423,000 jobs directly and 360,000 more jobs indirectly.

Added Donovan, ""In this new fiscal environment, every department shares a responsibility to make tough cuts so there's room for investments to speed economic growth. That's why, while this budget makes those critical investments—from growing neighborhoods of opportunity through our Choice Neighborhoods initiative to restoring Sustainable Communities planning grant funding—it also includes new savings proposals and some very difficult choices we would not have made in a better fiscal environment."""
02/14/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-030.cfm,HUD Budget Calls for Renewal of Sustainable Communities Grants,"WASHINGTON - Today, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Shaun Donovan addressed the National Association of Regional Councils and announced that HUD's fiscal year 2013 budget proposal includes $100 million to fund Regional Planning and Community Challenge Grants. The grants are part of the Partnership for Sustainable Communities, which is an association between HUD, the U.S. Department of Transportation, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency joining the federal government with local partners in taking a pragmatic, regional approach to problem solving that supports local leadership, local resources, and local innovation.
""An American economy built to last needs strong local and regional economies that include a wide range of businesses and attract a diverse workforce,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""The Sustainable Community Grants are a blue print for regional and local governments to plan for their economic future, and in this budget we are seeking restoration of those funds from Congress.""
The Sustainability Grants have been critical to the nation's economic recovery and over the last two years, HUD has awarded 152 grants, totaling $240 million that have in turn secured almost $253 million in private investment and commitments from local partners. The communities that have received these grants vary from rural communities in West Virginia and South Dakota to cities like Pittsburgh, Indianapolis, Austin and Memphis; who through these grants have partnered with their local business community to create sustainable economic development plans.
""In Memphis, our Community Challenge Grant has helped the city revitalize the neighborhoods surrounding the airport, while working with local businesses to create an economic development and workforce development plan to help them meet their workforce needs. FedEx has created over 3,000 jobs, and the grant is poised to create another 1,500 by attracting companies like Electrolux, Mitsubishi, and Nucor Steel,"" added Donovan.
In his address, Secretary Donovan also unveiled the creation of a Sustainability Resource Center webpage (http://www.huduser.org/portal/sustainability/home.html), which will function as a one-stop resource that highlights projects and best-practices from sustainability projects around the nation. Categories in the Resource Center include: economic competiveness, housing and transportation choices, regional planning, green building and rural and tribal sustainability.
""The Sustainable Communities Resource Center provides information to communities who are interested in implementing these principles, providing an equal playing field for those who want to apply for the grants in 2013, and allowing them to compare their vision to that of other similar cities or regions,"" said Shelley Poticha, Director of HUD's Office of Sustainable Housing and Communities.
HUD's Community Challenge Grants aim to reform and reduce barriers to achieving affordable, economically vital and sustainable communities. The funds are awarded to communities, large and small, to address local challenges to integrating transportation and housing. Such efforts may include amending or updating local master plans, zoning codes, and building codes to support private sector investment in mixed-use development, affordable housing and the re-use of older buildings. Other local efforts may include retrofitting main streets to provide safer routes for children and seniors, or preserving affordable housing and local businesses near new transit stations.
The Regional Planning Grant program supports regional planning efforts that integrate housing, economic and workforce development, and infrastructure investments to consider how all of these factors work together to create more jobs and economic opportunities. The program will place a priority on partnerships, including the collaboration of regional employers, philanthropy, and traditionally underrepresented groups. Recognizing that areas are in different stages of sustainability planning, HUD has established two categories for the Regional Planning Grant program. The first supports communities that are beginning the conversation about how best to align their housing, transportation, environment, and other infrastructure investments. The second recognizes that some communities have already achieved significant momentum and are prepared to move toward completion and implementation of regional plans for sustainable development.
In FY 2012 Congress did not fund HUD's Sustainable Community Grants.

OneCPD will fund three types of results-oriented technical assistance and capacity building: comprehensive assistance to help grantees improve their basic program performance; limited assistance to grantees that have clearly identified program gaps; and innovative assistance to assist grantees in restructuring their housing and community development programs to better meet the needs in their communities.
""These funds will help our partners work smarter and stretch federal investments for the greatest possible benefit to the people and places we serve,"" said Mercedes Márquez, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development. ""In today's budget environment, we not only have to do more with less, we have to perform at a very high level to make certain limited taxpayer dollars have the real and lasting impact.""
Through this Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA)/Request for Qualifications, HUD is offering up to $61 million for OneCPD and up to $995,000 for Core Curricula.

02/15/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-032.cfm,"Federal Government Settles Fraud Lawsuit Against Citimortgage, Inc. for Reckless Mortgage Lending Practices","Preet Bharara, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Helen Kanovsky, General Counsel of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (""HUD""), and David A. Montoya, the Inspector General of HUD, announced today that the United States has filed, and simultaneously settled, a civil fraud lawsuit against CITIMORTGAGE, INC. (""CITIMORTGAGE""), a subsidiary of CITIBANK, N.A. The Government's Complaint seeks damages and civil penalties under the False Claims Act and the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (""FIRREA"") for over six years of misconduct in connection with CITIMORTGAGE's participation in the Federal Housing Administration (""FHA"") Direct Endorsement Lender Program. In the settlement, CITIMORTGAGE ""admits, acknowledges, and accepts responsibility"" for certain conduct alleged in the Complaint including, ""[failing] to comply fully with all HUD-FHA requirements with respect to certain loans,"" and ""[submitting] to HUD-FHA certifications stating that certain loans were eligible for FHA mortgage insurance when in fact they were not."" CITIMORTGAGE also admitted that, as a result of its conduct, HUD incurred losses when certain loans that should never have been endorsed defaulted and agreed to pay $158.3 million to the United States in damages under the False Claims Act. The settlement was approved today by United States District Judge Victor Marrero.
Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara stated: ""For far too long, lenders treated HUD's insurance of their mortgages like they were playing with house money. In fact, they were playing with other people's money and other people's homes. CITIMORTGAGE is the latest in a series of cases this office has filed against lenders who flouted HUD requirements for making government-backed loans. We are pleased that, with today's settlement, CITIMORTGAGE has accepted responsibility for its conduct and agreed to pay damages in an amount that will significantly compensate HUD in this case for losses to the FHA insurance fund.""
HUD General Counsel Helen Kanovsky stated: ""It is critically important that FHA approved lenders meet our requirements for origination and underwriting of FHA loans. Lenders with authority to directly endorse FHA-insured mortgages must be serious about applying our underwriting guidelines and implement a quality control program that ensures compliance. This is a federal program and lenders who violate these requirements face potential False Claims Act liability.""
HUD Inspector General David A. Montoya stated: ""This settlement demonstrates that lenders are held accountable to strict underwriting standards. I want to assure all Americans that my office will remain vigilant in defending their interests, especially during this critical time for our country's economic recovery. We are committed to aggressively pursuing those whose misconduct contributed to the housing crisis and those who flagrantly continue to do so.""
The following allegations are based on the Complaint filed today in Manhattan federal court:
Since 1981, CITIMORTGAGE has been a participant in the Direct Endorsement Lender program (""DEL program""), a federal program administered by the FHA. As a Direct Endorsement Lender, CITIMORTGAGE has the authority to originate, underwrite, and endorse mortgages for FHA insurance. If a Direct Endorsement Lender approves a mortgage loan for FHA insurance and the loan later defaults, the holder of the loan may submit an insurance claim to HUD for the costs associated with the defaulted loan, which HUD must then pay. Under the DEL program, neither the FHA nor HUD reviews a loan before it is endorsed for FHA insurance. Direct Endorsement Lenders are therefore required to follow program rules designed to ensure that they are properly underwriting and endorsing mortgages for FHA insurance and maintaining a quality control program that can prevent and correct any deficiencies in their underwriting. These requirements include maintaining a quality control program that is independent of the lender's business operations; conducting a full review of all loans that go into default within the first six payments, known as ""early payment defaults""; and disclosing to HUD, within 60 days of initial discovery, all loans containing evidence of fraud or other serious underwriting problems. CITIMORTGAGE failed to comply with these basic requirements.
For example, the Complaint alleges that CITIMORTGAGE's business units routinely interfered with, and exerted pressure on, CITIMORTGAGE's quality control personnel in an effort to improperly reduce the quantity and severity of defects reported by the quality control unit. Among other things, the business units were instructed to apply ""brute force"" to pressure quality control personnel to reduce or downgrade their findings of defects, and to challenge all adverse findings by the quality control unit in an effort to drive down the defect rates. These practices caused a systemic breakdown of CITIMORTGAGE's quality control program. CITIMORTGAGE also failed to disclose to HUD loans containing fraud or other serious violations of HUD requirements and did not report a single fraudulent loan that it underwrote until July 2011, shortly after having received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorney's Office. CITIMORTGAGE did not review approximately 1,000 cases of potential fraud referred by its quality control unit. Its failure to maintain a compliant quality control program allowed widespread underwriting deficiencies to continue unabated.
As the Complaint further alleges, CITIMORTGAGE is also required to execute certifications for every mortgage loan that it endorses for FHA insurance. Since 2004, CITIMORTGAGE has endorsed nearly 30,000 mortgages for FHA insurance. Although CITIMORTGAGE certified that each of these loans was eligible for FHA insurance, it repeatedly submitted certifications that were knowingly or recklessly false. CITIMORTGAGE failed to perform basic due diligence, failed to verify information in the loan file that bore directly on the borrower's ability to make payments on the mortgage, and repeatedly endorsed mortgage loans that contained serious defects and departures from HUD's underwriting standards and thus were not eligible for FHA insurance. As a result, since 2004, more than 30% of loans originated or underwritten by CITIMORTGAGE have gone into default. CITIMORTGAGE's default rate soared to more than 47% for loans originated in 2006 and 2007, resulting in foreclosures, evictions, and ultimately depressed real estate values, all to the detriment of the national housing market and the national economy. These defaulted loans have resulted in HUD having to pay millions of dollars in insurance claims.
By filing its Complaint, the Government joined a private whistleblower lawsuit that had been filed against CITIMORTGAGE under the False Claims Act in August of last year. As part of the settlement, CITIMORTGAGE has admitted, acknowledged, and accepted responsibility for the following conduct:
CitiMortgage failed to comply fully with all HUD-FHA requirements with respect to certain loans. CitiMortgage failed to conduct a full review of certain loans that it endorsed for FHA mortgage insurance pursuant to the DEL Program that experienced early payment defaults: i.e., became 60 days past due within the first six payments. CitiMortgage endorsed for FHA mortgage insurance pursuant to the DEL Program certain loans that did not meet underwriting requirements contained in HUD's handbooks and mortgagee letters, and therefore were not eligible for FHA mortgage insurance under the DEL Program. As a result, CitiMortgage submitted to HUD-FHA certifications stating that certain loans were eligible for FHA mortgage insurance when in fact they were not; FHA insured certain loans endorsed by CitiMortgage that were not eligible for FHA mortgage insurance and that FHA would not otherwise have insured; and HUD consequently incurred losses when those CitiMortgage-endorsed loans defaulted.
• CitiMortgage failed to comply fully with all HUD-FHA requirements with respect to certain loans.
• CitiMortgage failed to conduct a full review of certain loans that it endorsed for FHA mortgage insurance pursuant to the DEL Program that experienced early payment defaults: i.e., became 60 days past due within the first six payments.
• CitiMortgage endorsed for FHA mortgage insurance pursuant to the DEL Program certain loans that did not meet underwriting requirements contained in HUD's handbooks and mortgagee letters, and therefore were not eligible for FHA mortgage insurance under the DEL Program.
• As a result, CitiMortgage submitted to HUD-FHA certifications stating that certain loans were eligible for FHA mortgage insurance when in fact they were not; FHA insured certain loans endorsed by CitiMortgage that were not eligible for FHA mortgage insurance and that FHA would not otherwise have insured; and HUD consequently incurred losses when those CitiMortgage-endorsed loans defaulted.
Pursuant to the settlement, CITIMORTGAGE will pay the United States $158.3 million within 30 days of the settlement. The $158.3 million that CITIMORTGAGE is paying to the United States to settle this lawsuit is in addition to the payments CITIGROUP, INC. has committed to make in connection with the $25 billion mortgage loan servicing settlement announced by the Department of Justice on February 9, 2012. Under the servicing settlement, the Government retained its full authority to pursue civil fraud lawsuits, such as this one, for damages and penalties when a bank fails to satisfy underwriting standards on government-insured loans.
The case is being handled by the Office's Civil Frauds Unit. Mr. Bharara established the Civil Frauds Unit in March 2010 to bring renewed focus and additional resources to combating financial fraud, including mortgage fraud.
The Complaint filed today against CITIMORTGAGE is the third civil fraud lawsuit brought by this Office in the last nine months against lenders for misconduct in connection with the FHA insurance program. On May 3, 2011, the Government sued DEUTSCHE BANK AG and MORTGAGEIT, INC., in connection with $386 million of FHA insurance claims paid by HUD for defaulted mortgage loans. On November 1, 2011, the Government sued ALLIED HOME MORTGAGE CORPORATION, one of its affiliates, its president and chief executive officer, and its executive vice president, in connection with $834 million of FHA insurance claims paid by HUD. The Office's Civil Frauds Unit is handling all three cases as part of its continuing investigation of reckless lending practices.
The Civil Frauds Unit works in coordination with President Barack Obama's Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force, on which Mr. Bharara serves as a Co-Chair of the Securities and Commodities Fraud Working Group. President Obama established the interagency Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force to wage an aggressive, coordinated, and proactive effort to investigate and prosecute financial crimes. The task force includes representatives from a broad range of federal agencies, regulatory authorities, inspectors general, and state and local law enforcement who, working together, bring to bear a powerful array of criminal and civil enforcement resources. The task force is working to improve efforts across the federal executive branch, and with state and local partners, to investigate and prosecute significant financial crimes, ensure just and effective punishment for those who perpetrate financial crimes, combat discrimination in the lending and financial markets, and recover proceeds for victims of financial crimes.
Mr. Bharara thanked HUD and HUD-OIG for their extraordinary assistance in this case. He also expressed his appreciation for the support of the Commercial Litigation Branch of the U.S. Department of Justice's Civil Division in Washington, D.C.
Assistant U.S. Attorneys Robert William Yalen, Joseph N. Cordaro, and Jaimie L. Nawaday are in charge of the case."

These funds are distributed each year based on a formula to eligible Indian tribes or their tribally designated housing entities for a range of affordable housing activities.
IHBG funds are intended to primarily benefit low-income families living on Indian reservations or in other communities. The amount of each grant is based on a formula that considers local needs and housing units under management by the tribe or designated entity.
""These funds are making a real difference in tribal communities each and every day,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""Projects include affordable housing, infrastructure upgrades, community centers and safety programs that every community needs to thrive. These efforts are part of a broader commitment to ensure Native American communities can build their economies in response to their needs and as they see fit.""
Eligible activities for the funds include housing development, assistance to housing developed under the Indian Housing Program, housing services to eligible families and individuals, crime prevention and safety, and model activities that provide creative approaches to solving affordable housing problems. The block grant approach to housing was enabled by the Native American Housing Assistance and Self Determination Act of 1996 (NAHASDA).

02/22/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-035.cfm,HUD and the National Fair Housing Alliance Launch Media Campaign to Fight Housing Discrimination,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the National Fair Housing Alliance (NFHA) announced today the launch of a new series of radio and print public service advertisements (PSAs). The advertisements are designed to teach individuals and families how to recognize and report discrimination in housing because of race, color, sex, religion, national origin, familial status and disability, including discrimination in mortgage lending because of issues related to pregnancy and/or parental leave.
The campaign includes print ads in English, Spanish, and Chinese. One print ad features a veteran who fought to defend our freedom yet faced discrimination because housing units were not accessible to people using wheelchairs. A second ad shows a doormat with the phrase ""Not Welcome"" which is designed to capture the attention of consumers so they can identify and report possible acts of housing discrimination. Another ad portrays an expectant mother who qualified for a mortgage but was illegally turned down for a loan because she was on maternity leave.
""Whether it's a veteran who is turned down for an apartment because he is in a wheelchair or a mother who is denied a loan because she is on maternity leave, housing discrimination is wrong in whatever form it takes,"" said John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""I'm thrilled that the National Fair Housing Alliance, in partnership with HUD, is helping us inform people across the nation about their rights and responsibilities under the Fair Housing Act. Now is the time to end housing discrimination.""
""The National Fair Housing Alliance is proud to work with HUD to combat housing discrimination through a creative set of public service announcements designed to educate millions of people about their rights,"" said Shanna L. Smith, President and CEO of the National Fair Housing Alliance. ""Where we live determines so much in life, including access to good education, health care and job opportunities. It is vital that people around the country be aware of their rights under the Fair Housing Act.""
The campaign also includes two sets of radio PSAs, in both English and Spanish. The PSAs portray people who experienced housing discrimination and encourage those who suspect discrimination to report it to HUD, and promote the Fair Housing Act's goal of inclusive neighborhoods. The PSAs are available at HUD.gov/fairhousing and www.nationalfairhousing.org.
The Fair Housing Act makes it illegal to discriminate in housing because of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, familial status and disability.
The PSAs encourage consumers to call 1-800-669-9777 or to visit www.hud.gov/fairhousing. The PSAs will be distributed to media outlets nationwide and will run and air in advertising time and space donated by the media."

FLAGSTAR agreed to pay $132.8 million to the United States in damages and penalties under the False Claims Act and to reform its business practices. The settlement was approved today by United States District Judge Katherine B. Forrest.
Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara stated: ""The lawsuit filed today is another stark example of how certain lenders put profit ahead of responsibility by recklessly churning out mortgage loans without regard to the risk that those loans would default or the significant consequences for the individual homeowners who would inevitably default on their loans, the housing market, and in the aggregate, our nation's economy. With today's settlement FLAGSTAR has accepted responsibility for its conduct, and committed to reform its business practices to ensure compliance with HUD requirements. Participation in this federally subsidized program is a privilege, not a right, and the cases this office has filed against banks that abuse this privilege should underscore our commitment to holding them to account.""
HUD General Counsel Helen Kanovsky stated: ""It is absolutely fundamental that lending institutions that earn the authority to directly endorse FHA-insured mortgages apply our standards. Lenders that play fast and loose with FHA requirements, placing families at unnecessary risk, do so at their own peril.""
HUD Inspector General David A. Montoya stated: ""Today's settlement is the latest example of our continued work of holding FHA Direct Endorsement Lenders accountable for adhering to strict underwriting standards. I laud the cooperation between my office and the Departments of Housing and Urban Development and Justice to bring this matter to closure. This success could not have happened without the untold energy and effort of my audit, investigative and legal staff, and their foundational role in enabling today's settlement.""
The following allegations are based on the Complaint filed today in Manhattan federal court:
FLAGSTAR has been a participant in the Direct Endorsement Lender program (""DEL program""), a federal program administered by the FHA, since 1988. The DEL program authorizes private-sector mortgage lenders (""Direct Endorsement Lenders"") to approve mortgage loans for insurance by the FHA. If a Direct Endorsement Lender approves a mortgage loan for FHA insurance and the loan later defaults, the holder of the loan may submit an insurance claim to HUD for the costs associated with the defaulted loan that HUD must then pay. Under the DEL program, neither the FHA nor HUD reviews a loan before it is endorsed for FHA insurance. Consequently, it is crucial that Direct Endorsement Lenders follow the DEL program rules in determining which loans to approve for FHA insurance. One such rule requires that Direct Endorsement Lenders employ experienced underwriters who have demonstrated knowledge and skill in mortgage evaluation and the principles of mortgage underwriting (""DE underwriters"") to conduct due diligence on loans before they are endorsed for FHA insurance.
From January 1, 2002 to the present (the ""Covered Period""), FLAGSTAR routinely delegated key underwriting functions to staff employees who were not DE underwriters. Notwithstanding the fact that these ""underwriting assistants"" lacked the qualifications necessary to be DE underwriters, they were frequently assigned by FLAGSTAR to review conditions that had been placed on FHA loans and to make the final decision on whether the requisite conditions for FHA insurance had been met. Even though FLAGSTAR permitted these key underwriting responsibilities and decisions to be delegated to underwriting assistants, FLAGSTAR's DE underwriters falsely certified to HUD, for each loan they manually underwrote and endorsed for government insurance, that the DE underwriters had themselves reviewed all of the loan documents and had exercised due diligence in underwriting the loans.
The Complaint also alleges that FLAGSTAR's DE underwriters repeatedly endorsed loans for FHA insurance that did not comply with HUD's underwriting requirements and thus were not eligible for government insurance. FLAGSTAR's DE underwriters nevertheless falsely certified to HUD, for each loan they endorsed for FHA insurance, that it was eligible for such insurance.
FLAGSTAR also set daily quotas for its DE underwriters and underwriting assistants, specifying the number of loans and conditions that they had to process per day, and paid these employees substantial incentive awards for exceeding their daily quotas. For example, in 2008, 10 FLAGSTAR DE underwriters earned at least $30,000 in incentive awards, with the top earner receiving $82,180.33 in extra compensation. The default rates on the loans that these 10 DE underwriters manually underwrote and approved for FHA insurance in 2008 were higher than the average default rate for all of the manually-underwritten loans that Flagstar approved for FHA insurance that year.
As part of the settlement, FLAGSTAR has admitted, acknowledged, and accepted responsibility for the following conduct:
Notwithstanding loan-level certifications to the contrary, a Flagstar DE underwriter did not, in every instance, 'personally review' 'all associated documents' for the loans that Flagstar manually underwrote and endorsed for FHA insurance during the Covered Period. Ina number of instances, underwriting assistants were the only ones to review documents associated with material conditions on the loans that Flagstar manually underwrote and approved for FHA insurance during the Covered Period. In a number of instances, underwriting assistants cleared material conditions — without DE underwriter supervision — relating to the borrower's income, assets and credit. Ina number of instances, notwithstanding loan-level certifications to the contrary, loans that Flagstar underwrote and approved for FHA insurance during the Covered Period, and for which HUD has paid insurance claims, did not comply with certain underwriting requirements contained in HUD's handbooks and Mortgagee Letters and were therefore ineligible for mortgage insurance under the DEL program. Flagstar made false certifications on loans that induced the FHA to accept for Government insurance loans that were ineligible and that the FHA otherwise would not have insured, and that resulted in losses to HUD when the loans defaulted.
• Notwithstanding loan-level certifications to the contrary, a Flagstar DE underwriter did not, in every instance, 'personally review' 'all associated documents' for the loans that Flagstar manually underwrote and endorsed for FHA insurance during the Covered Period.
• Ina number of instances, underwriting assistants were the only ones to review documents associated with material conditions on the loans that Flagstar manually underwrote and approved for FHA insurance during the Covered Period.
• In a number of instances, underwriting assistants cleared material conditions — without DE underwriter supervision — relating to the borrower's income, assets and credit.
• Ina number of instances, notwithstanding loan-level certifications to the contrary, loans that Flagstar underwrote and approved for FHA insurance during the Covered Period, and for which HUD has paid insurance claims, did not comply with certain underwriting requirements contained in HUD's handbooks and Mortgagee Letters and were therefore ineligible for mortgage insurance under the DEL program.
• Flagstar made false certifications on loans that induced the FHA to accept for Government insurance loans that were ineligible and that the FHA otherwise would not have insured, and that resulted in losses to HUD when the loans defaulted.
Under the settlement, FLAGSTAR has agreed to pay $15 million within 30 days after approval of the settlement by the Court, and to make additional payments totaling an additional $117.8 million as soon as FLAGSTAR meets certain financial benchmarks. The settlement payments represent the maximum that FLAGSTAR can pay, consistent with its banking regulatory requirements and other requirements, including capital requirements imposed by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the obligation of its parent holding company to satisfy its obligations in connection with the Troubled Asset Relief Program.
FLAGSTAR has also agreed to comply with all relevant HUD/FHA rules applicable to Direct Endorsement Lenders. FLAGSTAR has further agreed that, in addition to complying with all relevant HUD/FHA rules applicable to Direct Endorsement Lenders, FLAGSTAR's continued participation in the DEL program is conditioned on: (1) FLAGSTAR's completion of a one-year period during which FLAGSTAR's compliance with all HUD/FHA rules applicable to Direct Endorsement Lenders shall be monitored by a third party at FLAGSTAR's own expense (under certain conditions, this monitoring period may be extended by HUD for an additional two years); (2) FLAGSTAR's implementation of a training program for all employees involved in the origination and underwriting of FHA loans regarding all relevant HUD/FHA rules applicable to Direct Endorsement Lenders; and (3) FLAGSTAR's certification to HUD that the individuals in senior leadership positions who previously hadprimary responsibility for, respectively, initiating and overseeing FLAGSTAR's manual underwriting process are no longer employed by FLAGSTAR.
The case is being handled by the Office's Civil Frauds Unit. Mr. Bharara established the Civil Frauds Unit in March 2010 to bring renewed focus and additional resources to combating financial fraud, including mortgage fraud.
The Complaint filed today against FLAGSTAR represents the fourth civil fraud lawsuit brought by this Office in the last nine months alleging reckless or fraudulent lending practices by residential mortgage lenders. On May 3, 2011, the Government sued DEUTSCHE BANK and its subsidiary, MORTGAGEIT, INC., in connection with $386 million of FHA insurance claims paid by HUD for defaulted mortgage loans. On November 1, 2011, the Government sued ALLIED HOME MORTGAGE CORPORATION and its CEO in connection with $834 million of FHA insurance claims paid by HUD. On February 15, 2012, the Government sued and settled with CITIMORTGAGE, INC. (""CITIMORTGAGE""), a subsidiary of CITIBANK, N.A., for engaging in over six years of misconduct in connection with CITIMORTGAGE's participation in the DEL program. In the settlement, CITIMORTGAGE admitted and accepted responsibility for failing to comply with certain DEL program requirements, and agreed to pay $158.3 million in damages. The Office's Civil Frauds Unit is handling all four cases as part of its continuing investigation of reckless mortgage lending practices.
The Civil Frauds Unit works in coordination with President Barack Obama's Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force, on which Mr. Bharara serves as a Co-Chair of the Securities and Commodities Fraud Working Group. President Obama established the interagency Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force to wage an aggressive, coordinated, and proactive effort to investigate and prosecute financial crimes. The task force includes representatives from a broad range of federal agencies, regulatory authorities, inspectors general, and state and local law enforcement who, working together, bring to bear a powerful array of criminal and civil enforcement resources. The task force is working to improve efforts across the federal executive branch, and with state and local partners, to investigate and prosecute significant financial crimes, ensure just and effective punishment for those who perpetrate financial crimes, combat discrimination in the lending and financial markets, and recover proceeds for victims of financial crimes.
Mr. Bharara thanked HUD and HUD-OIG for their extraordinary assistance in this case. He also expressed his appreciation for the support of the Commercial Litigation Branch of the U.S. Department of Justice's Civil Division in Washington, D.C.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Christopher B. Harwood is in charge of the case."
02/27/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-036.cfm,HUD Charges Bank of America with Discriminating Against Homebuyers with Disabilities,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced that it is charging Bank of America with discriminating against homebuyers with disabilities. HUD alleges that Bank of America imposed unnecessary and burdensome requirements on borrowers who relied on disability income to qualify for their home loans and required some disabled borrowers to provide physician statements to qualify for home mortgage loans.
The Fair Housing Act makes it illegal to discriminate in the terms and conditions of a loan to an individual based on a disability, including imposing different application or qualification criteria, and makes it illegal to inquire about the nature or severity of a disability except in limited circumstances not applicable here.
""Holding homebuyers with disabilities to a higher standard just because they rely on disability payments as a source of income is against the law,"" said John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Mortgage companies may verify income and have eligibility standards but they may not single out homebuyers with disabilities to delay or deny financing when they are otherwise eligible.""
HUD's charge is based on a ""Secretary-initiated investigation,"" and the investigation of complaints filed by two individual borrowers in Michigan and one borrower in Wisconsin who claimed that Bank of America required them to provide personal medical information and documentation regarding their disability and proof of continuance of their Social Security payment in order to qualify for a home mortgage loan. The charge is also being issued as part of the work being conducted by the Federal Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force's non-discrimination working group.
According to HUD's charge, Bank of America allegedly asked some borrowers for proof of their disabilities and sought evidence of the continuation of their Social Security income before approving loans, after first denying them. The matter will now be handled by the Department of Justice.
FHEO and its partners in the Fair Housing Assistance Program investigate approximately 10,000 housing discrimination complaints annually. People who believe they are the victims of housing discrimination should contact HUD at 1-800-669-9777 (voice), (800) 927-9275 (TTY)."
02/27/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-037.cfm,FHA Takes Additional Steps to Bolster Capital Reserves,"WASHINGTON - As part of ongoing efforts to encourage the return of private capital in the residential mortgage market and strengthen the Federal Housing Administration's (FHA) Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund, Acting FHA Commissioner Carol Galante today announced a new premium structure for FHA-insured single family mortgage loans. FHA will increase its annual mortgage insurance premium (MIP) by 0.10 percent for loans under $625,500 and by 0.35 percent for loans above that amount. Upfront premiums (UFMIP) will also increase by 0.75 percent.
These premium changes will impact new loans insured by FHA beginning in April and June of 2012. Details will soon be published in a Mortgagee Letter to FHA-approved lenders.
""After careful analysis of the market and the health of the MMI fund, we have determined that it is appropriate to increase mortgage insurance premiums in order to help protect our capital reserves and to continue encouraging the return of private capital to the housing market,"" said Galante. ""These modest increases are one of several measures we are taking towards meeting the Congressionally mandated two percent reserve threshold, while allowing FHA to remain a valuable option for low- to moderate-income borrowers.""
The Temporary Payroll Tax Cut Continuation Act of 2011 requires FHA to increase the annual MIP it collects by 0.10 percent. This change is effective for case numbers assigned on or after April 1, 2012. FHA is also exercising its statutory authority to add an additional 0.25 percent to mortgages exceeding $625,500. This change is effective for case numbers assigned on or after June 1, 2012.
The UFMIP will be increased from 1 percent to 1.75 percent of the base loan amount. This increase applies regardless of the amortization term or LTV ratio. FHA will continue to permit financing of this charge into the mortgage. This change is effective for case numbers assigned on or after April 1, 2012.
FHA estimates that the increase to the upfront premium will cost new borrowers an average of approximately $5 more per month. These marginal increases are affordable for nearly all homebuyers who would qualify for a new mortgage loan. Borrowers already in an FHA-insured mortgage, Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM), and special loan programs outlined in FHA's forthcoming Mortgagee Letter will not be impacted by the pricing changes announced today.
Taken together, these premium changes will enable FHA to increase revenues at a time that is critical to the ongoing stability of its Mutual Mortgage Insurance (MMI) Fund, contributing more than $1 billion to the Fund, based on current volume projections through Fiscal Year 2013."
02/27/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-040.cfm,HUD Launches Public Database of HUD-Assisted Households,"WASHINGTON - In another effort to advance the Obama Administration's Open Government Initiative, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today launched a public database (www.huduser.org/portal/pumd/index.html) to help the research community better understand the characteristics of households receiving assistance under the Department's main rental programs. Read more about HUD's new public data sample.
HUD's new Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) database includes household-level data for five percent of households assisted through the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV), Public Housing, Section 8 Project-based Rental, and the Section 202/811 Programs. Updated annually, this database will not identify the households in the sample but will include data on family type, household income, race, gender, and other household characteristics.
""This public database helps to provide a much clearer picture of how our programs work,"" said Raphael Bostic, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research. ""Better information makes for better public policy. We're offering the research community and, by extension, the American public, a more transparent window into our programs and the people we serve.""
In addition to household characteristics, the database will offer geographic details about where tenants live, including the state, whether the location is in a metropolitan area, whether the location is in an urban area, and the poverty rate for the location's census tract.
With this household-level dataset, researchers can calculate results and statistical relationships at levels of demographic or geographic detail not available in HUD's tabular reports. For example, the PUMS database contains data on the amount of adjusted income each family pays towards rent and utilities. The new public data reveals that 10.4 percent of HUD-assisted families living in rural areas pay at least 40 percent of their adjusted income for rent and utilities, compared to 8.8 percent of their urban counterparts.
HUD takes the protection of tenant privacy seriously. Therefore, no personally identifiable information will be released, such as social security numbers, names, birthdates or addresses to assure that it will not be possible to identify any individual or household. HUD intends to limit the sample to just five percent of available data and will mask data for variables with a high identification risk. The sample size is large enough to be statistically valid and representative of states and the nation as a whole while small enough to preserve privacy.
Those who wish to access this new database will have to formally register. Users will have to provide their names, institutions and email addresses and certify that they will use the data for legitimate research purposes and will in no way use the data to try to identify households."
02/29/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-041.cfm,"HUD Makes $5 Million Available to Help Communities Begin 'Grassroots' Plan for Housing, Community Revitalization","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today announced $5 million is being made available in Choice Neighborhoods Planning Grants to help communities begin the comprehensive neighborhood planning process to transform, rehabilitate and preserve public housing and privately-owned HUD-assisted housing. Read HUD's FY 2012 Choice Neighborhoods Notice of Funding Availability (www.grants.gov/search/search.do;jsessionid=LWCnPTBLz6QB1Q1Ln1pJ0mh0dKn3L474pv4TkTvLlYpjcK6hlFv5! 1869518295?oppId=147433&mode=VIEW).
""This is the third year communities across the U.S. will have the opportunity to compete for this funding that will allow them to begin the grassroots efforts to creatively link affordable housing with quality education, public transportation, good jobs and safe streets,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""The Choice Neighborhoods program is a central element of the Obama Administration's interagency, place-based strategy to support local communities in developing the tools they need to revitalize neighborhoods of concentrated poverty into neighborhoods of opportunity.""
The Choice Neighborhoods Planning Grants will enable communities to create a comprehensive transformation plan to transform public and/or assisted housing within a distressed.
The funding is intended to help communities transform distressed public and assisted housing into sustainable, mixed-income housing that connects to key services, such as education and transportation, and supports positive outcomes for the neighborhood's families. Eligible applicants are public housing authorities, local governments, tribal entities, nonprofit organizations, and for-profit developers that apply jointly with a public entity. Applicants must demonstrate their plan to revitalize the neighborhood through public-private partnerships that seek to develop high-quality public schools and early learning programs, improve public transportation, and improve access to jobs and well-functioning services.
Applicants have until May 1, 2012 to apply for the FY2012 Choice Neighborhoods Planning Grants. HUD anticipates awarding approximately 17-20 grants with a maximum award of $300,000 each. For more information on current grantees, please see www.partner.hud.gov.
Choice Neighborhoods is a centerpiece of the White House Neighborhood Revitalization Initiative (www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/oua/initiatives/working-groups) (NRI). HUD partners with the Departments of Treasury, Justice, Education, and Health and Human Services on the NRI, an interagency effort to align federal housing, education, justice, and health programs to transform distressed, high-poverty neighborhoods into neighborhoods of opportunity."
03/02/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-043.cfm,Obama Administration Releases February Housing Scorecard,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of the Treasury today released the February edition of the Obama Administration's Housing Scorecard - a comprehensive report on the nation's housing market. Data continues to show signs that the housing market is strengthening, although the recovery remains fragile. The supply of new and existing homes on the market continued to decline last month. However, home prices dipped again as seasonal lows continued for the fourth month in a row. The continued fragility of the housing market underscores the need for recently-announced expansions of assistance to help prevent foreclosures and strengthen hard hit communities. The full Housing Scorecard is available online at www.hud.gov/scorecard.
""Since April 2009, more than 13 million homeowners have taken advantage of our refinance programs. Following enhancements to the Home Affordable Refinance Program, another 300,000 families have already started the process of refinancing and stand to save on average $2,500 per year - the equivalent of a good-sized tax cut. So the Administration's efforts have produced significant positive benefits,"" said HUD Assistant Secretary Raphael Bostic. ""But 1 in 5 Americans still owes more than their home is worth. This lasting scar of the Great Recession driven by housing's collapse is a clear sign that we are not yet out of the woods. That is why we are asking the Congress to approve the President's housing proposals so that more homeowners can receive assistance.""
Included in this month's Making Home Affordable Program Report (www.treasury.gov/initiatives/financial-stability/results/MHA-Reports/Pages/default.aspx) are detailed assessments for the largest mortgage servicers participating in the program with results from the fourth quarter of 2011. The Servicer Assessments - first introduced in June 2011 and published quarterly - have set a benchmark for disclosure around servicer efforts to assist struggling homeowners.
""The Making Home Affordable Program has established critical standards that have changed the mortgage industry for the better, and the assessments have been a principal tool for measuring that progress,"" said Treasury Assistant Secretary for Financial Stability Tim Massad. ""By shining the spotlight on key practices, we have prompted servicers to improve their implementation of the Making Home Affordable Program. However, there is still more work to be done to ensure that the industry treats all borrowers properly. The implementation of the broader standards required by the settlement, together with our continued compliance efforts, will help bring this about.""
The standards established by the Making Home Affordable Program were also a guide for many of the servicing standards included in the historic $25 billion settlement recently announced between the federal government, 49 state Attorneys General and the five largest mortgage servicers regarding mortgage servicing and foreclosure deficiencies.
Since inception of the Making Home Affordable Program, Treasury has required participating servicers to take specific actions to improve their processes through ongoing program reviews. The latest Servicer Assessments summarize performance on metrics in three categories of program implementation: identifying and contacting homeowners; homeowner evaluation and assistance; and program reporting, management and governance. Results for the fourth quarter of 2011 show that servicers are focusing attention on areas identified in previous program reviews and, as a result, are demonstrating considerable improvement in program implementation:
Mortgage servicers show continued improvement in calculating homeowner income, which is used to determine a homeowner's eligibility and modified payment amount under the program. Servicers are more effectively evaluating homeowners under program eligibility criteria as performance in the ""second look disagree"" category, which reflects the rate at which Treasury's program reviews disagree with the servicers' decision not to assist a homeowner, remains consistently below the established benchmark.
• Mortgage servicers show continued improvement in calculating homeowner income, which is used to determine a homeowner's eligibility and modified payment amount under the program.
• Servicers are more effectively evaluating homeowners under program eligibility criteria as performance in the ""second look disagree"" category, which reflects the rate at which Treasury's program reviews disagree with the servicers' decision not to assist a homeowner, remains consistently below the established benchmark.
For the fourth quarter of 2011, seven servicers were found in need of moderate improvement and two servicers were found to need minor improvement with respect to the specific metrics tested. No servicer was found in need of substantial improvement this quarter.
In the case of JPMorgan Chase Bank, NA and Bank of America, NA, this quarter's assessments found that both servicers had improved their practices. Bank of America was found to have remedied substantially all specific areas needing improvement that were identified in the prior assessments and continued to demonstrate improved processes generally. JPMorgan Chase demonstrated marked progress in remedying a number of outstanding issues from previous quarters. This includes improving the speed at which they process eligible homeowners for permanent HAMP modifications and strengthening their internal quality assurance processes around the program.
As a result of the findings in prior Servicer Assessments, Treasury has been withholding payment of incentives from JPMorgan Chase Bank and Bank of America. As part of the mortgage servicing settlement, Treasury has agreed to release withheld incentives for past deficiencies. However, Treasury will continue compliance reviews and retains the right to withhold incentives in the future.
As the Administration continues to push servicers to provide more effective assistance to struggling homeowners, the ongoing recovery of the housing market demonstrates the need for the Administration's efforts. The February Housing Scorecard features key data on the health of the housing market and the impact of the Administration's foreclosure prevention programs, including:
Market data show progress on housing overhang and sales but continued fragility in home prices. The supply of homes on the market continued to decline last month. At the current rate, it would take 6.1 months to turn over the supply of existing homes currently on the market - and just 5.6 months to turn over the stock of new homes for sale - the lowest inventory of homes for sale since 2006. Existing home sales continued to improve this month, reaching their highest pace since May 2010. However, home prices dipped again in December, as measured by the Case-Shiller index, as seasonal lows continued for the fourth month. The Administration's foreclosure programs are providing relief for millions of homeowners as we continue to recover from an unprecedented housing crisis. More than 5.7 million modification arrangements were started between April 2009 and the end of January 2012 - including nearly 1.8 million trial modification starts through the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) and more than 1.2 million FHA loss mitigation and early delinquency interventions. The Administration's programs continue to encourage improved standards and processes in the industry, with HOPE Now lenders offering families and individuals more than 2.7 million proprietary mortgage modifications through January. Homeowners entering HAMP demonstrate a high likelihood of long-term success in the program. As of January, more than 950,000 homeowners received a permanent HAMP modification, saving more than $530 on their mortgage payments each month. Eighty-five percent of homeowners entering the program in the last 19 months have received a permanent modification, with an average trial period of 3.5 months. Homeowners in HAMP permanent modifications have saved an estimated $11 billion to date.

03/05/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-039.cfm,HUD Kicks Off Series of Consultations with Native American Leaders,"WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) kicked off a series of consultations with tribal leaders in preparation for HUD's forthcoming study on the chronic housing needs in Indian Country, ""Assessment of Native American, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian Housing Needs (www.huduser.org/portal/native_american_assessment/home.htm)."" During these consultations, tribal leaders will have an opportunity to comment on the scope and design of the pending study. HUD will hold six regional meetings and two national meetings, the first of which in Washington, DC.
""A well executed and thoughtful study of the critical housing needs of Native Americans will inform policy and allow HUD to serve these communities,"" said Raphael Bostic, HUD Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research. ""HUD's assessment will also give tribes vital data so they can use existing resources most effectively to improve housing conditions for Native American families.""
HUD's study will consider housing conditions and other socio-economic situations to give a broader context to housing needs of Assessment of Native Americans, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians. In directing this study, Congress said, ""It is clear that the housing needs of Native Americans living on reservations are substantial, but better data is needed to quantify those needs in order for HUD and Congress to better address them.""
These official consultations build on seven Native Housing Needs Outreach Sessions held between December 2010 and March 2011. An eighth session, designated specifically as tribal leader consultation, was held on July 27, 2011. These sessions introduced the Housing Needs Study to participants and stakeholders. The sessions produced many helpful comments and recommendations, which were incorporated into the latest draft of the study's outreach plan and survey instruments."
03/06/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-045.cfm,FHA Announces Price Cuts to Encourage Streamline Refinancing,"WASHINGTON - Today, Acting Federal Housing (FHA) Commissioner Carol Galante announced significant price cuts to FHA's Streamline Refinance Program that could benefit millions of borrowers whose mortgages are currently insured by FHA. Beginning June 11, 2012, FHA will lower its Upfront Mortgage Insurance Premium (UFMIP) to just .01 percent and reduce its annual premium to .55 percent for certain FHA borrowers.
To qualify, borrowers must be current on their existing FHA-insured mortgages which were endorsed on or before May 31, 2009. Late last month, FHA also announced it will increase its upfront premiums on most other loans by 75 basis points to 1.75 percent. In addition, FHA will raise annual premiums 10 basis points and 35 basis points on mortgages higher than $625,500. Read FHA's new Mortgagee Letter on HUD's website.
""This is one way that FHA can make a real difference to help homeowners who are doing the right thing, paying their bills on time and want to take advantage of today's low interest rates,"" said Galante. ""By significantly reducing costs for these borrowers, we can make certain they cut their monthly mortgage burden which will benefit the housing market and the broader economy in the process.""
Currently, 3.4 million households with loans endorsed on or before May 31, 2009, pay more than a five percent annual interest rate on their FHA-insured mortgages. By refinancing through this streamlined process, it's estimated that the average qualified FHA-insured borrower will save approximately $3,000 a year or $250 per month. FHA's new discounted prices assume no greater risk to its Mutual Mortgage Insurance (MMI) Fund and will allow many of these borrowers to refinance into a lower cost FHA-insured mortgage without requiring additional underwriting. FHA-insured homeowners should contact their existing lender to determine their eligibility.
Last month, the Obama Administration announced a broad package of actions and legislative proposals to help responsible homeowners save thousands of dollars through refinancing. This includes the changes announced today that will benefit current FHA borrowers - particularly those whose loan value may exceed the current value of their home. By lowering monthly mortgage costs for home-owners, FHA hopes to help more borrowers stay in their homes, thereby decreasing the potential for future default and reducing losses to the Mutual Mortgage Insurance (MMI) Fund.
The changes outlined in today's mortgagee letter apply to all mortgages insured under FHA's Single Family Mortgage Insurance Programs except:
Title I
Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECM) Section 247 (Hawaiian Homelands) Section 248 (Indian Reservations) Section 223(e) (Declining Neighborhoods)
• Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECM)
• Section 247 (Hawaiian Homelands)
• Section 248 (Indian Reservations)

03/06/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-046.cfm,"HUD Discrimination Charge Against Pennsylvania Landlord Results in $15,000 Settlement","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced today that the owner of Breckenridge Plaza Apartment complex in Phoenixville, PA, has agreed to pay $15,000 as part of a consent decree in federal district court to settle claims that the development's on-site manager, Morris Zelikovsky, discriminated against families with children. In August 2011, HUD charged the owner and manager of Breckenridge with charging families higher rent when they have children and indicating a preference against families with children.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to impose different rental charges and terms of a lease on households because of the presence of children.
HUD uncovered the alleged discrimination after the Fair Housing Council of Suburban Philadelphia (FHCSP) filed a complaint with HUD claiming that tests FHCSP conducted revealed that the manager of Breckenridge charged households with children more than same-size households without children. In one test, Zelikovsky told a FHCSP tester posing as a mother with a son that she would have to pay $775 for a two-bedroom apartment that had been advertised as renting for $740. Later that same day, Zelikovsky told a different tester posing as a married woman with no children that a two-bedroom apartment rented for $745 a month. In another test, Zelikovsky told a tester posing as a married woman with no children that a two-bedroom apartment was $740 a month, while telling a tester who inquired later that day whether children were welcome, ""It's just going to be higher at $775 a month.""
""No family should have to pay more for a place to live or be discouraged from living someplace simply because they have children,"" said John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD is committed to ensuring that property owners meet their obligation to treat every applicant and resident the same.""
HUD's charge also alleged that the owner and manager were liable for making discriminatory statements, including in advertisements on craigslist.org, indicating a preference against families with children, and discouraging families with children from applying for housing. One of the ads placed by the manager stated: ""Winter Special Price for Two Adults.""
After HUD issued its charge of discrimination, Zelikovsky chose to have the case heard in Federal District Court, where, under a consent order, the owner agreed to pay $15,000 to FHCSP and implement a non-discrimination policy at Breckenridge. The complex will also display fair housing signs in its leasing office, as well as the ""Equal Housing Opportunity"" logo on its vacancy signs and other rental materials."
03/08/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-049.cfm,HUD Seeks Public Comment on Rental Assistance Demonstration,"WASHINGTON - Before implementing a new comprehensive tool to preserve public housing and other federally assisted housing, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is seeking public comment beginning today on the Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD). See Federal Register Notice (https://federalregister.gov/a/2012-5626). In addition to the Federal Register notice, HUD has posted guidance - PIH Notice 2012-18 (HA) - with proposed details for RAD's implementation.
""For more than 75 years, the federal government has invested billions of dollars in the development and maintenance of public and multifamily housing, but for public housing alone there is still $25.6 billion in much-needed large scale repairs,"" said HUD Assistant Secretary Sandra Henriquez. ""When Congress approved this demonstration in November, it opened the door for HUD to test this new, comprehensive, critical tool to help preserve and enhance America's affordable housing - including public housing.""
The Rental Assistance Demonstration is a central part of HUD's rental housing preservation strategy, which works to preserve the nation's stock of deeply affordable rental housing, promote efficiency within and among HUD guidelines, and build strong, stable communities. RAD will enable public housing agencies and multifamily housing owners to continue to make standard life-cycle improvements to their inventory and modernize or replace obsolete units to stem the loss of affordable housing. The demonstration will offer almost 60,000 public housing units and thousands more units in the Moderate Rehabilitation, Rent Supplement, and Rental Assistance Payment programs reliable, long term, project-based rental assistance contracts. These new contracts will enable owners to leverage other public and private funding - bringing over $1 billion dollars in expected private financing to help reduce the large backlog of capital repair needs. In the process, RAD will help create and support local construction jobs in communities across the country.
The purpose of RAD is to demonstrate the extent to which the conversion to long-term Section 8 rental assistance helps preserve and improve covered projects, particularly with respect to the ability of public housing agencies and multifamily owners to access private debt and equity to address long-term capital needs. RAD is also designed to test the extent to which residents take advantage of being provided greater choice in where to live after the conversion of assistance.
HUD is seeking public comment on the overall proposed implementation procedures for RAD, including eligibility criteria, ranking factors, application instructions, review and approval processes, and anticipated timelines. Upon review of comments, HUD will issue a final notice guiding RAD's implementation. However, certain eligible properties currently assisted under the Rent Supplement and Rental Assistance Payment programs will be allowed to apply for conversion of assistance prior to the publication of the final notice. Both the proposed implementation procedures and instructions on how to submit public comments are available on the RAD website, www.hud.gov/rad."
03/08/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-050.cfm,"HUD Launches ""Know It. Avoid It. Report It."" Mortgage Scam Prevention Consumer Awareness Campaign in Atlanta","ATLANTA - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced the second phase of the Know It. Avoid It. Report It. consumer awareness campaign in Atlanta. The campaign, launched during National Consumer Protection Week, March 4 - 10, is designed to educate consumers on loan modification and foreclosure scams and encourage them to take action.
In 2011, HUD introduced the Know It. Avoid It. Report It. campaign in Miami, Chicago and Los Angeles as a way to inform struggling homeowners about the importance of working with HUD-approved agencies as they fight to save their homes. HUD is launching the campaign in Atlanta, an attractive area for scams, as it is one of the cities struggling with high foreclosure rates.
""One should never have to pay for foreclosure counseling or assistance,"" said Ed Jennings, Jr., Region IV, Regional Administrator for HUD in Atlanta. ""That's why we need homeowners to be vigilant by seeking out HUD-approved housing counseling agencies to obtain help and avoid being scammed.""
As a result of the foreclosure crisis, millions of distressed homeowners have become vulnerable targets to criminal third-party scammers, con artists, and thieves. Out of desperation to save their homes, borrowers are giving thousands of dollars to mortgage relief scam artists who are preying on struggling homeowners.
Mortgage relief scam artists employ these scams with terrible consequences for homeowners. Their tactics come in various forms including giving the false impression that they are affiliated with government programs, charging illegal up-front fees, and executing fraudulent lease-back financing schemes.
HUD encourages homeowners to call 1-888-995-HOPE (4673) or visit www.hud.gov/preventloanscams to get the facts about mortgage fraud, and report suspected scammers.
To obtain help and avoid being the victim of mortgage scams go to HUD approved housing counseling agencies in Georgia."
03/08/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-051.cfm,HUD Awards $23 Million to Test New Energy-Saving Approaches in Older Multi-Family Housing Developments,"WASHINGTON - All across the country, owners of aging apartment complexes are looking for ways to reduce their energy consumption and save money. In order to test new and innovative ways to cut energy bills and to finance energy efficiency upgrades in existing multi-family residential properties, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today awarded nearly $23 million to a dozen organizations on the cutting edge of bringing energy-saving solutions to the housing market.
These affordable housing providers, technology firms, academic institutions and philanthropic organizations were selected to receive grant funding to test new approaches to implement and to pay for these energy-saving upgrades that may become the model for financing these 'retrofits' on a wider scale in the future (see grant summaries below). The federal grants are directly leveraging an additional $60 million in philanthropic, local and private capital.
""These grants are being awarded to a diverse collection of organizations that will help us find new ways to cut energy, save money and generate jobs!"" said Acting Federal Housing Commissioner Carol Galante. ""This is more than just 'going green,' it's about bringing real dollars and cents solutions to a sector of the market that is currently wasting money heating and cooling buildings, some of which were built more than a generation ago.""
Theodore Toon, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary for HUD's Office of Affordable Housing Preservation, added, ""These energy-saving innovations will be driven by the private sector who will help lead the way in bringing down the costs in our older multi-family housing stock. HUD's new Energy Innovation Fund will become the model for others to follow in the national effort to bring a new generation of energy efficiency to older residential properties.""
The goal of HUD's pilot program is to develop ideas and mechanisms that could potentially be replicated nationally, as well as help create industry standards in the home energy efficiency retrofit market. In addition, the pilot program will create public/private partnerships as a result of capital investments from private industries and create green jobs in construction, property management, and technical analysis (e.g. energy audits and building commissioning), including opportunities for low income residents.
HUD is awarding Energy Innovation Funds to the following organizations:"
03/13/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-052.cfm,HUD Awards $201 Million for New Local Homeless Programs,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Shaun Donovan today awarded nearly $201 million to support 731 new local homeless programs across the country. This funding provides critically needed emergency shelter, transitional housing and permanent support for individuals and families and is a significant part of the Obama Administration's strategic plan to prevent and end homelessness. View a complete list of all the state and local projects awarded funding today on HUD's website.
HUD recently awarded $1.47 billion to renew funding to more than 7,100 existing local homeless programs operating across the U.S. That funding ensured housing and service programs remained operating in 2012. The grants announced today will support new local programs never before funded by HUD (see attached chart).
""Today's grantees will join the tens of thousands of local programs that are on the front lines of helping those who might otherwise be living on our streets,"" said Donovan. ""It's incredible that as we work to recover from the greatest economic decline since the Great Depression, the total number of homeless Americans is declining, in large part because of these funds.""
According to the latest data reported by more than 3,000 cities and counties throughout the U.S., homelessness declined 2.1 percent between 2010 and 2011 and a remarkable 12 percent among homeless veterans.
The funding will support:
Housing for more than 15,000 persons as well as services for individuals and families who are homeless across the country; Housing and services for 8,728 persons in families; and Housing and services for 5,684 persons who are chronically homeless, including both individuals and families.
• Housing for more than 15,000 persons as well as services for individuals and families who are homeless across the country;
• Housing and services for 8,728 persons in families; and
• Housing and services for 5,684 persons who are chronically homeless, including both individuals and families.
HUD grants include $15.7 million to support 103 new housing and service programs located in rural communities. Funding to these never-before-funded programs in less populated areas continues HUD's efforts to confront ruralhomelessness. HUD is delivering record funding to meet the unique challenges homeless individuals and families living in rural areas face.
HUD's Continuum of Care grants provide permanent and transitional housing to homeless persons as well as services including job training, health care, mental health counseling, substance abuse treatment and child care. Continuum of Care grants are awarded competitively to local programs to meet the needs of their homeless clients. These grants fund a wide variety of programs from street outreach and assessment programs to transitional and permanent housing for homeless persons and families. Continuum of Care programs include:
Supportive Housing Program (SHP) offers housing and supportive services to allow homeless persons to live as independently as possible. Shelter Plus Care (S+C) provides housing and supportive services on a long-term basis for homeless persons with disabilities, (primarily those with serious mental illness, chronic problems with alcohol and/or drugs, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or related diseases) and their families who were living in places not intended for human habitation (e.g., streets) or in emergency shelters. Single-Room Occupancy Program (SRO) provides rental assistance for homeless persons in one-person housing units that contain small kitchens, bathrooms, or both.

In 2010, President Obama and 19 federal agencies and offices that form the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH) launched the nation's first comprehensive strategy to prevent and end homelessness. Opening Doors: Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness (www.usich.gov/opening_doors/) puts the country on a path to end veterans and chronic homelessness by 2015 and to end homelessness among children, family, and youth by 2020.
In addition to HUD's annual grant awards, HUD continues to manage the $1.5 billion Homelessness Prevention and Rapid Re-housing (HPRP) Program. Made possible through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, this three-year grant program is intended to prevent persons from falling into homelessness or to rapidly re-house them if they do. To date, more than 1.2 million persons have been assisted through HPRP."
03/14/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-054.cfm,HUD Offers $25 Million to Convert Multifamily Apartment Buildings into Assisted Living Facilities,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today announced the availability of up to $25 million to help convert multifamily apartment complexes into assisted living facilities or service-enriched housing for low-income senior citizens. The funding offered through HUD's Assisted Living Conversion Program will provide grants for the physical conversion of eligible multifamily assisted housing projects (or portions of projects) to assisted living facilities or service-enriched housing. Read the funding notice published today (www.grants.gov/search/search.do;jsessionid=QnGHPfQYhpZ7yjCnYhX8wGBnvLL9JKPMF41L062Z11 PyydnBpyQS!582005965?oppId=152693&mode=VIEW).
""These grants offer an opportunity for low-income seniors to remain living independently in their homes while still receiving the services they need on a day-to-day basis. Most importantly, they will not have to move from their familiar surroundings as they become older and need supportive services,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan.
Assisted living facilities are designed to accommodate low-income frail elderly persons and persons with disabilities who can live independently but need assistance with the activities of daily living such as help with eating, bathing, dressing and home management activities. These affordable facilities directly provide or facilitate the delivery of support services such as personal care, transportation, meals, and housekeeping.
The Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly of 2010 act expanded the Assisted Living Conversion Program to give the owners the option to convert housing to an assisted living facility or service-enriched housing. Service-enriched housing is housing that is designed to accommodate frail elderly persons or elderly persons with service needs who are aging in place. Generally these are elderly persons are able to live independently but need assistance with activities of daily living comparable to services typically provided in a licensed assisted living facility. These supportive services must be available through a licensed or certified third party service provider.
The developments receiving this funding will rely on a variety of programs to support elderly resident's service needs, including Medicaid home and community-based waiver services, State Home Health Care programs, State Assisted Living Services funds, Medicare/Medicaid Programs, Money Follows the Person funds, Congregate Housing Services Program funds, Service Coordinator funds or similar programs. Since the funds awarded under the Assisted Living Conversion Program do not cover services, project owners must be able to facilitate the delivery of services to residents.
The grants are awarded on a competitive basis. The maximum amount of each award is $5 million. During the review process, HUD assesses several factors including: the extent to which the conversion is needed; the quality and effectiveness of the proposal; the ability of the project owner to secure other community resources; as well as the capacity of the project owner to carry out the conversion."
03/16/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-055.cfm,HUD Announces More Than $42 Million in Counseling Grants to Help Families Find and Keep Housing,"WASHINGTON - As part of its continuing effort to help families find decent housing and to prevent future foreclosures, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced more than $42 million in housing counseling grants to 468 national, regional and local organizations. As a result of this funding, hundreds of thousands of households will have a greater opportunity to find housing or keep their current homes. See list of all counseling agencies awarded funding today.
""The HUD-approved counseling agencies this funding supports are crucial in helping struggling families on a one-to-one basis to manage their money, navigate the homebuying process, and secure their financial futures,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""We fought hard to persuade Congress to restore funding for housing counseling in HUD's budget and now we're working to make these important resources available as quickly as possible.""
Housing counseling grants will assist families in becoming homeowners, many for the first time, and remaining homeowners after their purchase. They also provide assistance to renters and the homeless, and offer financial literacy training to individuals and families.
""These funds are complemented by the roughly $2.5 billion provided to the states as part of the $25 billion mortgage servicing settlement. Most states can use those funds for foreclosure prevention activities such as housing counseling and legal aid services,"" added Secretary Donovan.
More than $36 million in grant funds will directly support the housing counseling services provided by 27 national and regional organizations, 6 multi-state organizations, 16 State Housing Finance Agencies (SHFAs) and 419 local housing counseling agencies. In addition, HUD is awarding $2 million to three national organizations to train counselors who will receive the instruction and certification necessary to effectively assist families with their housing needs.
Counseling agencies will also receive $4 million to help assist senior citizens seeking reverse mortgages or Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECM). These agencies will provide counseling for the rapidly growing number of elderly homeowners who seek to convert equity in their homes into income that can be used to pay for home improvements, medical costs, and other living expenses.
National and regional agencies distribute much of HUD's housing counseling grant funding to community-based grassroots organizations that provide information and guidance to low- and moderate-income families seeking to improve their housing conditions. In addition, these larger organizations help improve the quality of housing counseling services and enhance coordination among counseling providers.
Grant recipients help homebuyers and homeowners realistically evaluate their readiness for a home purchase, understand their financing and downpayment options, and navigate what can be an extremely confusing and difficult process. In addition to providing counseling to homebuyers and renters, these organizations assist homeless persons in finding the transitional housing they need to move toward a permanent place to live.
Grantees also help combat predatory lending by helping unwary borrowers review their loan documentation, and avoid potential mortgage scams, unreasonably high interest rates, inflated appraisals, unaffordable repayment terms, and other conditions that can result in a loss of equity, increased debt, default, and even foreclosure. Likewise, foreclosure prevention counseling helps homeowners facing delinquency or default employ strategies, including expense reduction, negotiation with lenders and loan servicers, and loss mitigation, to avoid foreclosure. With foreclosures at critical levels nationwide, these services are more important than ever.
HUD awards annual grants under the housing counseling program through a competitive process. Organizations that apply for grants must be HUD-approved and are subject to monitoring and oversight to maintain their HUD-approved status.

These foundations often do their philanthropic work without much recognition - until now. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is collaborating with the Council on Foundations in the launch of a new awards program to recognize community foundations for the excellent work they do along with their public partners in the area of housing and community development.
The new HUD Secretary's Award for Community Foundations (www.huduser.org/portal/research/CommFndAwards_2012_Intro.html) seeks nominations from non-profit place-based philanthropic organizations which work closely with the public sector on projects involving housing and neighborhood improvements; education; health and recreation; transportation; community participation; arts and culture; public safety; sustainability; and economic development.
""We're looking for a unique group of foundations that are redefining what it means to give back to their communities,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""Working closely with state, local and even federal agencies, these foundations work day in and day out to transform the relationship between the philanthropic and public sectors. It's increasingly clear that neither sector can solve our challenges alone but together, anything is possible. This awards program is just our way of saying thank you.""
""The Council on Foundations is honored to join HUD in recognizing the outstanding work of community foundations in establishing public-private partnerships that create sustainable and lasting change in local communities,"" said Jeff Clarke, interim president and CEO, the Council on Foundations. ""As strategic advisors, investors and visionaries, Community Foundations are essential partners to government in building viable communities.""
A jury will select a total of 10 community foundations, one each from HUD's defined regions of the country. Awards will be given to community foundations for completed or ongoing initiatives that are executed in partnership with a local, regional, or federal government agency. The Council on Foundations must receive completed application by 11:59 pm (Pacific Daylight Time) on Friday, May 11, 2012. Any entries submitted after this date will not be eligible.

The grant funding announced today will clean up lead and other health hazards in nearly 6,000 high-risk homes, train workers in lead safety methods, and increase public awareness about childhood lead poisoning. Lead is a known toxin that can impair children's development and have effects lasting into adulthood.
""Protecting the health and well-being of children is a top priority for HUD. We know that housing conditions directly affect the health of its residents,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""These grants will help communities around the nation protect families from lead exposure and other significant health and safety hazards.""
""With these grant awards, HUD makes it clear that providing healthy and safe homes for families and children is a priority,"" said Jon Gant, Director of HUD's Office of Healthy Homes and Lead Hazard Control. ""It's simple: you can't be healthy if your home is sick. HUD is committed to protecting children from these hazards, as part our efforts to help make the nation's housing healthy and sustainable.""
The following is a breakdown of the funding announced today:
* This includes the $5,329,093 HUD is awarding to assist in the promotion and development of programs to concurrently identify and address multiple housing-related health hazards with lead hazard control intervention work.
Through these grant programs, HUD's Office of Healthy Homes and Lead Hazard Control promotes local efforts to eliminate dangerous lead hazards from lower income homes; stimulates private sector investment in lead hazard control; and educates the public about the dangers of lead-based paint. A complete project-by-project summary of the programs awarded grants today can be found on HUD's website.
Lead Hazard Control Grant Programs
Even though lead-based paint was banned for residential use in 1978, HUD estimates that approximately 24 million homes still have significant lead-based paint hazards today. Lead-contaminated dust is the primary cause of lead exposure and can lead to a variety of health problems in young children, including reduced IQ, learning disabilities, developmental delays, reduced height, and impaired hearing. At higher levels, lead can damage a child's kidneys and central nervous system and cause anemia, coma, convulsions and even death.
The funding announced today directs critical funds to cities, counties and states to eliminate dangerous lead paint hazards in thousands of privately-owned, low-income housing units. These funds are provided through HUD's Lead-Based Paint Hazard Control and Lead Hazard Reduction Demonstration grant programs. To expand the reach of HUD's Lead Hazard Control Program. HUD is also providing over $5.3 million to help communities transform their lead hazard control programs to address multiple housing-related hazards.

(AHK) to originate and underwrite new mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). In addition, the MRB is imposing $268,000 in penalties against the Dallas-based mortgage lender for repeated and serious violations of FHA requirements.
""When we begin to see a pattern of failure to apply our standards, we will act to protect FHA's financial health as well as consumers,"" said Acting FHA Commissioner Carol Galante. ""We expect lenders to meet our requirements, not just to protect the safety of our insurance fund but to make certain they don't set up borrowers to fail by putting them into mortgages they ultimately can't sustain.""
Among more than a dozen violations of FHA standards, the MRB found AHK:
• Failed to adequately document the source and/or adequacy of borrowers' funds used for closing;
• Failed to correctly calculate or adequately document borrowers' income;
• Failed to verify the stability of borrowers' income;
• Failed to ensure borrowers were eligible for an FHA-insured mortgage loan;
• Failed to ensure the property met eligibility requirements;
• Failed to comply with HUD's property flipping requirements, including a case involving a property purchased for $14,100 that was resold approximately three months later for $125,000; and;

03/27/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-063.cfm,"HUD, VA to Provide Permanent Housing and Support to More Than 10,000 Homeless Vets","WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric K. Shinseki announced today that HUD will provide $72.6 million to public housing agencies in all 50 states and the District of Columbia to supply permanent housing and case management for more than 10,000 homeless veterans.
The permanent supportive housing assistance announced today is provided through HUD's Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing Program (HUD-VASH), a program administered by HUD, VA, and local housing agencies to provide permanent housing with case management and other supportive services for homeless veterans across the country. Read a complete local breakdown of the rental vouchers announced today.
""It's a national disgrace that one out of every six men and women in our shelters once wore a uniform to serve our country,"" said HUD Secretary Donovan. ""But we know that by providing housing assistance and case management services, we can significantly reduce the number of veterans living on our streets. Working together, HUD, VA and local housing agencies are making real progress toward ending veteran homelessness once and for all.""
""Under the leadership of President Obama, we have made significant progress in the fight to end homelessness among veterans, but more work remains,"" said VA Secretary Shinseki. ""The partnership between the federal government and community agencies across the country has strengthened all of our efforts to honor our veterans and keep us on track to prevent and eliminate veteran homelessness by 2015.""
This funding to local housing agencies is part of the Obama Administration's commitment to end Veteran and long-term chronic homelessness by 2015. Opening Doors: Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness serves as a roadmap for how the federal government will work with state and local agreements to confront the root causes of homelessness, especially among former servicemen and women. HUD's annual ""point in time"" estimate of the number of homeless persons and families for 2011 found that veteran homelessness fell by nearly 12 percent (or 8,834 people) since January 2010.
The grants announced today are part of $75 million appropriated for Fiscal Year 2012 to support the housing needs of homeless veterans. VA Medical Centers (VAMC) provide supportive services and case management to eligible homeless veterans. This is the first of two rounds of the 2012 HUD-VASH funding. HUD expects to announce the remaining funding by the end of this summer.
VAMCs work closely with homeless veterans then refer them to public housing agencies for these vouchers, based upon a variety of factors, most importantly the duration of the homelessness and the need for longer term more intensive support to obtain and maintain permanent housing. The HUD-VASH program includes both the rental assistance the voucher provides and the comprehensive case management that VAMC staff provides.
Veterans participating in the HUD-VASH program rent privately owned housing and generally contribute no more than 30 percent of their income toward rent. VA offers eligible homeless veterans clinical and supportive services through its medical centers across the U.S., Guam and Puerto Rico."
03/29/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-064.cfm,HUD Awards $33 Million to 28 Local HIV-AIDS Housing Programs,"WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced that more than 1,200 extremely low-income persons living with HIV/AIDS will continue to receive permanent housing as a result of nearly $33 million in grants HUD is awarding. Annually, these grants will provide permanent supportive housing for those households so they can manage their health and access needed supportive services such as case management and employment training.
The funding announced today is offered through HUD's Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS Program (HOPWA) and will renew HUD's support of 28 local programs in 17 states (see attached chart and individual project descriptions below).
""These grants offer housing, vital healthcare and hope to hundreds of households that combine to literally save lives,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""Having stable housing can make all the difference to the health of someone living with HIV/AIDS who might otherwise be struggling to live on our streets.""
Many of the projects receiving renewed funding provide for specialized models in outreach and service delivery, including efforts that target help to persons who have been homeless or are at extreme risk of becoming homelessness. These grants offer innovations in HIV care to increase job readiness and employment opportunities for persons in stabilized care. The grants announced today also support Opening Doors (www.usich.gov/PDF/OpeningDoors_2010_FSPPreventEndHomeless.pdf), the Obama Administration's strategic plan to prevent and end homelessness.
In addressing goals under these strategies, HUD will contribute a variety of housing resources to promote better integration of housing interventions into comprehensive HIV care systems. Housing assistance and related services funded by HOPWA are an essential part of the comprehensive system of care for low-income persons living with HIV/AIDS. A stable home environment is also vital for these households in allowing them to access consistent medical care and maintain their health. Furthermore, secure housing can be a platform for improved quality of life.
Ninety percent of HOPWA funds are distributed by formula to cities and states based on the number of AIDS cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. HUD's formula grants are managed by 135 local and state jurisdictions, which coordinate AIDS housing efforts with other HUD and community resources. Earlier this year, HUD awarded these jurisdictions nearly $300 million in formula grants. This year, HUD had made available a total of $332 million in HOPWA funds to help communities provide housing for this special needs population. Overall, these resources assist over 60,000 households annually to provide stable housing and reduced risks of homelessness for those living with HIV and other challenges."
04/05/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-066.cfm,"HUD Announces 'Maternity Discrimination Settlements,' Kicks Off Fair Housing Month","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced today that it has reached settlement agreements with Magna Bank in Nashville, TN, and Home Loan Center, Inc., in Irvine, CA, resolving allegations that the two lenders denied mortgage loans to women because they were pregnant and temporarily on maternity leave. HUD is announcing the discrimination settlements as part of its annual Fair Housing Month commemoration kick-off.
The Fair Housing Act, which was enacted into law 44 years ago this month, prohibits housing discrimination in lending, sales, and rental transactions based on a person's sex or family status. The Fair Housing Act also prohibits housing discrimination based on race, color, national origin, religion, and disability.
""It is against the law for any lender to deny a mortgage loan to a woman because she is pregnant or on paid maternity leave,"" said John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Women shouldn't have to choose between buying or refinancing a home and exercising their right to have a family. HUD will take appropriate action anytime we determine that discrimination has occurred.""
The settlement agreement signed by Magna Bank requires the bank to pay one woman $14,085 for allegedly requiring her to return to work before her loan application could be approved. In another settlement agreement, Home Loan Center, Inc., agreed to pay a Las Vegas woman $15,000 for denying her application to refinance her mortgage because she was on maternity leave.
Fair Housing Month, celebrated each April, was created to commemorate the enactment of the 1968 Fair Housing Act. The Fair Housing Act became law one week after the April 4 assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and prohibited discrimination based on race, color, national origin, and religion. In 1974 the Act was expanded to include discrimination based on gender. And in 1988 the Act was expanded to cover persons with disabilities and discrimination based on family status, including a woman's maternity status.
HUD held a wreath-laying ceremony at the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial on the National Mall on April 4 to kick off its annual Fair Housing Month celebration. This year's Fair Housing Month theme is ""Creating Equal Opportunity in Every Community."" The theme reflects HUD's commitment to working with its fair housing partners to create communities of opportunity for all and to protect the right of everyone to live where they choose, free from discrimination.
Throughout the month of April, television and print public service announcements focusing on discrimination against women on maternity leave, families with children, and veterans with disabilities will run on television stations and in magazines across the country. On April 11, HUD will conduct a National Fair Housing Outreach Day to educate teachers and families with school-age children about their rights under the Fair Housing Act.

04/06/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-065.cfm,"HUD, City Of Long Beach Sign $3.7 Million Agreement that will Create Jobs, Contracting Opportunities","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced today that it has signed a $3.7 million agreement with the city of Long Beach, CA, that will help to create job opportunities for low-income residents and contracting opportunities for the businesses that hire them. The agreement was reached after a HUD review determined that the city's Section 3 implementation plan was inadequate.
Section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 promotes employment, training, and contracting opportunities to low-income residents who live in communities where HUD funds are spent, and the businesses that hire them. As a result, Section 3 promotes self-sufficiency for low-income persons, fosters the creation of small businesses, and helps build strong local economies.
""Job creation is essential to boosting local economies and helping families survive today's tough economic times,"" said John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""This agreement goes a long way toward helping the city of Long Beach create much needed jobs for its residents and contracting opportunities for area businesses.""
Under the terms of the Voluntary Compliance Agreement (VCA), the city of Long Beach will:
Provide $3.7 million in future contracting opportunities to Section 3 businesses located in Long Beach; Use Section 3 businesses for projects where the use of Section 3 contractors is not typically required, such as the city's $29 million Airport Terminal Project; Develop a plan describing how smaller contracts worth less than $100,000 and projects worth less than $200,000 will utilize Section 3 businesses; and Implement a Section 3 business incentive program to encourage contractors to use Section 3 businesses for future construction projects, until the $3.7 million is spent.

04/06/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-067.cfm,U.S. Announces Settlement Against Chicago Owners and Management Companies,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) today announced a settlement with Wilmette Real Estate & Management Company, LLC; WR Property Management, LLC; 14 affiliated limited liability companies and Mr. Cameel Halim in Chicago and Evanston, Illinois.
According to HUD and EPA, these owners and management companies in Chicago and Evanston, IL violated the federal Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act (Residential Lead Act) and implementing regulations (Lead Disclosure Rule) by failing to properly inform some tenants that their homes may contain potentially dangerous levels of lead. The City of Chicago Department of Public Health issued lead abatement notices for approximately 22 properties owned or managed by the companies.
As a result of the settlement, Mr. Halim and the 16 companies will replace windows or remove lead-based paint from the windows in 14 buildings containing 463 units, and abate friction and impact porch surfaces and stabilize deteriorating lead-based paint on remaining porch surfaces in 10 buildings, within five years (see attached lists). In addition to the estimated $2.3 million of window replacement/abatement and porch remediation work, Mr. Halim and the companies will also pay a $125,000 civil monetary penalty.
""It's absolutely critical that families have the right information so that they can protect their children's health,"" said Jon L. Gant, Director of HUD's Office of Healthy Homes and Lead Hazard Control. ""This settlement sends a message to landlords of housing across the country that they make sure to properly disclose the required lead information to the families they rent to.""
""Through these enforcement actions, EPA is sending a clear message to landlords and property managers that protecting children from exposure to lead-based paint is one of our highest priorities,"" EPA Region 5 Administrator Susan Hedman said.
Background
The Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 is one of the primary federal enforcement tools to prevent lead poisoning in young children. The Lead Disclosure Rule, authorized by the Residential Lead Act, requires home sellers and landlords of housing built before 1978 to provide an EPA-approved ""Protect Your Family From Lead in Your Home"" pamphlet and warn of the hazards of lead-based paint to purchasers and tenants. In addition sellers and landlords must share knowledge of lead-based paint and/or lead-based paint hazards on a disclosure form that both parties must sign and provide any available records or reports. The form should be attached to the sales contract or lease. Sellers must also provide purchasers with an opportunity to conduct a lead-based paint inspection and/or risk assessment at the purchaser's expense. Acceptable lead disclosure forms can be found at http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/healthy_homes/enforcement/disclosure and www.epa.gov/lead/pubs/leadbase.htm.
Health Effects of Lead-Based Paint
Lead exposure causes reduced IQ, learning disabilities, developmental delays, poorer hearing, and a host of other health problems in young children. Many of these effects are thought to be irreversible. In later years, lead-poisoned children are much more likely to drop out of school, become juvenile delinquents and engage in criminal and other anti-social behavior. As reported in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers have found that even at low levels, lead exposure in children can significantly impact IQ and even delay puberty in young girls.
At higher levels lead can irreversibly damage a child's kidneys and central nervous system and cause anemia, coma, convulsions and even death. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an estimated 250,000 American children have elevated blood-lead levels.
Eliminating lead-based paint hazards in pre-1978 housing is essential if childhood lead poisoning is to be eradicated. Although the prevalence of childhood lead poisoning has dropped significantly, the risk to children in low-income, older housing without federal assistance remains high. HUD estimates about 23 million homes still contain significant lead-based paint hazards with the potential to poison young children."
04/06/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-068.cfm,Obama Administration Releases March Housing Scorecard,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of the Treasury today released the March edition of the Obama Administration's Housing Scorecard - a comprehensive report on the nation's housing market. Data in the March Housing Scorecard show some promising signs of stability, though the overall outlook remains mixed. Mortgage delinquencies continued a downward trend and were substantially below year ago levels, while sales of existing homes in January and February marked the strongest start to a year since 2007. However, data on home prices changed little from the previous month - marking a fifth month of seasonal lows. The full report is available online at www.hud.gov/scorecard.
""The data this month show that we're making important progress in providing relief to homeowners under the Obama Administration's programs. With fewer borrowers falling behind on their mortgages and some 425,000 families taking advantage of our enhanced Home Affordable Refinance Program - standing to save on average $2,500 per year - it's clear that the Administration's efforts continue to provide significant positive benefits,"" said HUD Assistant Secretary Raphael Bostic. ""But 1 in 5 Americans still owes more than their home is worth. That's why the Administration's recent proposals are critical to promoting healing in the market. Our efforts to ramp up economic development in fragile neighborhoods and to expand homeowner access to low-interest refinance options reflect our commitment to turning these markets towards growth. That is why we are asking the Congress to approve the President's housing proposals so that more homeowners can receive assistance.""
""The Administration's programs have helped millions of homeowners while establishing standards for better outcomes across the mortgage industry,"" said Treasury Assistant Secretary for Financial Stability Tim Massad. ""Recent expansions of our efforts and the historic mortgage settlement will bring substantial relief to even more homeowners as our nation continues to heal from an unprecedented foreclosure crisis.""
The March Housing Scorecard features key data on the health of the housing market and the impact of the Administration's foreclosure prevention programs, including:
Market data show progress on home sales and mortgage delinquencies, but continued fragility overall. Sales of existing homes remained high in February and - with newly revised data on January sales - mark the strongest start to a year since 2007. Mortgage delinquency rates continued a downward trend and are substantially below year ago levels.In addition,foreclosure completions ticked downward last month, although increased activity is expected in the coming months as firms lift processing delays following the landmark mortgage servicing settlement reached with the five largest banks in early February. The Administration's recovery efforts continue to help millions of families deal with the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. More than 5.8 million modification arrangements were started between April 2009 and the end of February 2012 - including more than 1.8 million HAMP trial modification starts and nearly 1.3 million FHA loss mitigation and early delinquency interventions. The Administration's programs continue to encourage improved standards and processes in the industry, with HOPE Now lenders offering families and individuals nearly 2.8 million proprietary mortgage modifications through January. Over 1.1 Million Homeowner Assistance Actions Granted through Making Home Affordable. Eligible homeowners entering HAMP continue to demonstrate a high likelihood of long-term success in the program. As of February, more than 970,000 homeowners received a permanent HAMP modification, saving more than $530 on their mortgage payments each month. Eighty-five percent of homeowners entering the program in the last 20 months have received a permanent modification, with an average trial period of 3.5 months. Homeowners in HAMP permanent modifications have saved an estimated $11.6 billion to date.

Also featured this month is the Administration's Housing Scorecard Regional Spotlight on market strength in Chicago, Illinois and surrounding communities. The Chicago metro area was one of the hardest hit areas in the nation following the housing market downturn and an area where the Administration's broad approach to stabilizing the housing market has been very active.
""The challenges that the national data show for the broader housing market are even more complex in the Chicago market,"" said HUD Assistant Secretary Raphael Bostic. ""The Administration is working hard to help all homeowners who have been hit hard during the crisis and, as this Regional Spotlight shows, our efforts have helped more than 220,000 families in Chicago avoid foreclosure. But we have much more to do to reach the many households who still face trouble and to help the local market recover.""
The bi-monthly Housing Scorecard Regional Spotlight features data on the health of the Chicago housing market and impact of efforts to help homeowners at the local level including:
The challenges in the far-spanning Chicago housing market have been more severe than those in most areas of the nation, as a high percentage of distressed mortgages, high vacancy rates, a surge in suburban poverty, and many severely underwater mortgages contribute to continued fragility. Sales of bank-owned properties and short sales remain high at 35 percent of existing home sales in the Chicago market compared to 29 percent nationally, which contributes to continued weakness in local home prices. Moreover, foreclosure processing in Illinois takes an average of 575 days which means distressed mortgages in Chicago remain unresolved in the foreclosure pipeline 50% longer on average than in other cities. More than 220,000 Chicago households have received mortgage modifications, many directly through Administration programs. Since April 1, 2009 approximately 220,500 mortgage assistance interventions have been offered to homeowners in the Chicago metropolitan area. More than 132,500 interventions were offered through HAMP and the FHA loss mitigation and early delinquency intervention programs. An estimated additional 88,000 proprietary modifications have been offered through HOPE Now Alliance servicers. While some homeowners may have received help from more than one program, the number of times assistance has been offered in the Chicago MSA is nearly double the number of foreclosures completed during this period (111,900). The Administration's Hardest Hit Fund and Neighborhood Stabilization Programs have fueled local foreclosure prevention efforts and market stability. Illinois has received more than $400 million through the Hardest Hit Fund to implement local solutions to mitigate borrower mortgage defaults and address the range of factors that contribute to a family's financial problems. Moreover, approximately $264.9 million has been awarded to 12 jurisdictions through the Neighborhood Stabilization Program to help purchase or redevelop residential properties and address the effects of abandoned and foreclosed housing. Both programs have helped provide stability to the Chicago housing market.

04/16/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-069.cfm,HUD Indefinitely Debars Four Individuals Following Reverse Mortgage Scam that Targeted Seniors,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced the indefinite debarment of three South Florida mortgage loan officers and a Pittsburgh title agent following their criminal convictions on charges they defrauded elderly borrowers, mortgage lenders and the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). Marcos Echevarria, Louis Gendason, John Incandela and Kimberly Mackey pled guilty to charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud for their part in a $2.5 million nation-wide reverse mortgage scam. All four individuals are currently serving prison terms.
HUD's debarment action effectively bans these individuals from conducting business with the federal government in the future. The Court has also ordered them to make restitution.
""HUD will not tolerate those who abuse the mortgage system and target elderly borrowers for their personal gain,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""Reverse mortgages can help senior citizens on fixed incomes plan for the future, but it is shameful to bilk the elderly out of their life savings.""
Echevarria, Gendason and Incandela worked for 1st Continental Mortgage, which maintains offices in Fort Lauderdale and Boca Raton, Florida. According to the government's complaint, the three used their positions to identify financially vulnerable elderly borrowers and pressured them to refinance their existing mortgages into an FHA-insured reverse mortgage or Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM). A reverse mortgage allows borrowers, who are at least 62 years of age, to convert the equity in their homes into a monthly stream of income, or a line of credit.
The complaint also notes that Kimberly Mackey, a licensed title agent and proprietor of Real Estate One Land Services, Inc., located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, fraudulently closed the loans by failing to pay off the borrowers' existing mortgages. It further notes that Mackey attempted to conceal the fraudulent loan closings by preparing false HUD-1 settlement documents that showed that the existing mortgages had, in fact, been paid off.
The scheme also involved changing real estate appraisal reports to fraudulently represent equity in the properties. In some cases the scheme also involved negotiating fake short sales defrauding the lenders holding the borrowers' first mortgages.
The elderly victims lived in seven different states between May 2009 and November 2010. This case was investigated by agents from the HUD-Office of Inspector General; the Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation; the U.S. Postal Inspection Service; the FBI Miami Field Office; and the state of Florida's Office of Financial Regulation. The case was prosecuted by the Justice Department's Civil Division's Office of Consumer Protection Litigation and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida."

Jones was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on March 29, 2012. As the second most senior official at HUD, Jones will be charged with managing the Department's day-to-day operations, a nearly $47 billion annual operating budget, and the agency's 8,900 employees.
""President Obama and Secretary Donovan have blessed me with the opportunity to join HUD during this critical period when we continue to support a fragile recovery from an historic housing crisis,"" said Jones. ""I'm ready to help continue transforming an organization charged with moving beyond the yesterday's experiences to tackle today's challenges and those we'll face tomorrow.""
""Maurice has one of the strongest public and private sector track records I've seen for building consensus and solving big problems,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""As we continue to confront our current housing challenges, HUD will certainly benefit from Maurice's intellect, his proven management experience and his great people skills.""
Jones added, ""Public service has been a passion of mine since my high school days in rural Lunenburg County, Virginia. As a ninth grader, I was fortunate enough to be selected to serve as a page during that year's legislative session of the Virginia General Assembly. The experience changed my life. I resolved then and there to enter public service when I grew up so that I too could work to make things better.""
Jones most recently worked in Norfolk, Virginia as President of Pilot Media, the largest print and digital organization in Hampton Roads. Pilot Media's businesses include The Virginian-Pilot newspaper, Pilot Interactive and Targeted Publications and Media. Jones served as President and Publisher of The Virginian-Pilot, the locally owned and managed newspaper founded in 1865.
Jones joined Landmark Media Enterprises, owner of Pilot Media, in 2005, serving as Vice President of the Landmark Publishing Group, consisting of multiple newspapers including the News & Record in Greensboro, NC; The Roanoke Times; The Capital Gazette in Annapolis, MD; and Landmark Community Newspapers, Inc., based in Shelbyville, Ky. In 2006 Jones became the Vice President and General Manager of Pilot Media and in 2008 he became president and publisher of The Virginian-Pilot.
A Kenbridge, Virginia native, Jones also served as commissioner of the Virginia Department of Social Services and deputy chief of staff to then-Virginia Governor Mark Warner. At the U.S. Treasury Department, Jones was special assistant to the general counsel and he also served as legal counsel to the Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund and as director of the fund during the Clinton Administration. Jones also worked for the law firm of Hunton & Williams in Richmond, Virginia and he was a partner at a Partner in Venture Philanthropy Partners, a firm that invests millions in the Washington, DC metropolitan area to assist low-income children.
Jones graduated from Hampden-Sydney College in Hampden-Sydney, Virginia and attended Oxford University in England on a Rhodes scholarship. He later earned a law degree from the University of Virginia."

05/01/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-073.cfm,HUD Awards $56 Million in Grants to Promote Affordable Housing and Economic Development in Native American Communities,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today awarded more than $56 million to 76 tribal communities throughout the nation to improve housing conditions, promote community development and to spur local economies with construction projects and jobs. The competitive grants awarded are part of HUD's Indian Community Development Block Grant (ICDBG) Program that address a wide variety of community development and affordable housing activities for low- to moderate-income families (see grant chart below and project summaries here).
""These grants are a step forward in forging solutions to improve the housing and economic conditions for some of our country's most culturally rich neighborhoods,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""I'm impressed at the energy and creativity in how these communities are leveraging public funds to create lasting solutions for countless families.""
The recipients will use these grants to develop viable communities including rehabilitating housing or building new homes or to purchase land to support new housing construction. The funding can also used to build infrastructure such as roads, water and sewer facilities. To stimulate economic development and job growth, recipients use the grants to establish commercial, industrial and agricultural projects. Recipients also use the funding to build community and health centers, or to start businesses to support the community including shopping centers, manufacturing plants, restaurants or convenience stores and gas stations. Specific examples of this sort of economic and community development include:
The Caddo Nation in Oklahoma will use its $800,000 grant to build a community facility for elderly low income residents. The Ho-Chunk Nation in Wisconsin will devote its $600,000 grant to install solar photovoltaic panels on low-income single-family home and apartment rental units to decrease resident energy cost by 24 percent, and to decrease emissions due to the energy efficiency benefits. The Cook Inlet Tribal Council in Alaska will target its $600,000 grant to help build a group home for Alaska Native youth near Bartlett High School and the Alaska Native Heritage Center, reducing the number of homeless youth and increasing academic stability and support. The Chemehuevi Indian Tribe of California will use its $604,998 grant to upgrade the reservation's existing infrastructure by replacing segments of old sewer lines serving tribal members. The original installations date back to the 1950s. The Seminole Nation of Oklahoma will use its $800,000 grant to build a Multi Purpose Community Health and Wellness Center. The Sac and Fox Tribe in Iowa will use its $600,000 grant to construct the Meskwaki Travel Center that will include a convenience store, car and truck fueling stations, a branch bank, sandwich shop, truck stop and a truck wash/mechanics bay. The project will retain 28 jobs and create 8 new positions. The ICDBG program was established in 1977 to help Indian tribes and Alaska Native villages to meet their community development needs. Federally recognized tribes, bands, groups, nations or eligible tribal organizations compete for this funding.

05/01/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-074.cfm,HUD Approves $10.7 Million Refinancing Deal for Rio Grande Hospital,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced a commitment to insure a mortgage loan to Valley Citizen's Foundation for Health Care, Inc. which is doing business as Rio Grande Hospital in Del Norte, Colorado. It is estimated the refinanced debt will save the hospital more than $168,000 a year in principal and interest and more than $1.6 million over the life of the loan.
The $10.7 million loan is made possible through the Section 223(a)(7) component of the Federal Housing Administration's (FHA) Section 242 Hospital Mortgage Insurance Program.
""Part of FHA's core mission is to help healthcare facilities that are struggling with high interest rates and limited credit options,"" said Acting FHA Commissioner Carol Galante. ""The savings provided through FHA refinancing will help facilities like Rio Grande hold downthe cost of healthcare and better serve their community.""
FHA's Section 223(a)(7) program provides for refinancing of a hospital's debts without requiring new construction or renovation. The program is designed to help healthcare facilities with existing FHA-insured mortgages reduce the interest rate on their debt. Rio Grande's two FHA-insured loans were used to construct a replacement facility in 2003 and a rural health clinic in 2007.
""The opportunity for Rio Grande Hospital to refinance debt strengthens its long term ability to continue to provide healthcare services to residents of the Valley. HUD recognizes how vital community and rural hospitals are to providing critical care and I am so pleased that we was able to participate in approving this debt restructuring,"" said Rick M. Garcia, HUD's Rocky Mountain Regional Administrator in Denver.
Since 1968, FHA has insured over 400 mortgage loans totaling over $17 billion to hospitals in 43 states and Puerto Rico. The Section 242 program serves the full spectrum of acute care hospitals, including small rural hospitals, inner-city hospitals, and large academic medical centers."
05/03/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-076.cfm,HUD and Obama Administration Officials Host Georgia White House Forum on Housing,"WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) hosted a White House Forum on Housing to discuss programs and initiatives promoted by the Obama Administration that help responsible homeowners and struggling communities hit hardest by the housing crisis. The White House Housing Forum convened Georgia housing officials, regional and local leaders, housing and development alliances and community advocates in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building this afternoon for the discussion.
""The housing crisis which began in 2007 saw Georgia's foreclosure rate more than double in the two years before we took office, tens of thousands of families saw their home values plummet, their equity wiped out, and their communities devastated,"" said U.S. Housing and Urban Development Regional Administrator Edward ""Ed"" Jennings. ""However, since then and because of the efforts of the Obama Administration we've seen the market stabilize and begin to recover. When we have forums like the one here today at the White House it brings together people and ideas that will help ensure that recovery continues.""
Forum sessions, led by White House and Administration officials, explored tools and resources offered by the federal government and detailed help for homeowners, assistance for underserved communities, insights for cultivating public-private partnerships and the future of housing. Additionally, the historic $25 billion foreclosure settlement, the President's new housing initiatives and legislative proposals impacting housing reforms were discussed.
The unprecedented mortgage servicers settlement is the largest federal-state civil agreement ever obtained and is the result of extensive investigations led by federal agencies, including the Department of Justice, HUD, the HUD Office of the Inspector General (HUD-OIG), 49 state attorneys general and state banking regulators across the country. The joint federal-state group entered into the agreement with the nation's five largest mortgage servicers: Bank of America Corporation, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Wells Fargo & Company, Citigroup Inc., and Ally Financial Inc. (formerly GMAC) - and as a result all Americans are ensured a fair shot, their fair share and fair deal.
""These forums represent the Obama Administration's ongoing efforts to take aggressive steps on behalf of homeowners who have played by the rules and are trying to get ahead,"" Tammye Trevino, Administrator of USDA's Rural Housing Service said. ""During these meetings, USDA will work with industry stakeholders, citizens and other federal officials to build upon the Administration's goals to help responsible homeowners refinance loans, stay in their homes and shore up the nation's housing market.""
Participants shared ""best practices"" and provided feedback on the effectiveness of targeted federal programs and initiatives.
Additionally, in the coming weeks, the Obama Administration will hold additional housing events including a Making Home Affordable homeowner event where borrowers can learn about foreclosure prevention options and get immediate help connecting with a loan servicer representative and local housing counselor. The event will be held in Atlanta, GA at the Georgia International Convention Center on June 1-2.
""More than 30,000 Georgia homeowners currently have lower mortgage payments through the Administration's Making Home Affordable Program, but we know there are additional homeowners who are struggling and eligible for help,"" said Treasury Homeownership Preservation Chief Darius Kingsley. ""We will continue our collaborative work with partners across the state to reach homeowners who are eligible for assistance through programs like Making Home Affordable and HomeSafe Georgia. Treasury and HUD will be sponsoring a free event for homeowners at the Georgia International Convention Center in Atlanta on June 1 and 2--and we encourage any homeowner who is struggling with their mortgage payments to attend."""
05/04/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-075.cfm,Donovan Joins State and Local Leaders to Formally Open Marrero Commons on the Site of the Former B.W. Cooper,"NEW ORLEANS - In the wake of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the B.W. Cooper Public Housing Development in New Orleans became uninhabitable. On that very site today, U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan joined New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu, Senator Mary Landrieu, Congressman Cedric Richmond and Housing Authority of New Orleans (HANO) Administrative Receiver David Gilmore to cut the ribbon in front of one of the 50 new homes that are part of the first phase of construction for the Marrero Commons mixed-income community. B.W. Cooper is the last of ""the Big Four"" public housing developments in New Orleans being redeveloped after Hurricane Katrina rendered them uninhabitable.
""Three years ago, we broke ground on a dream that has now come true,"" said Donovan. ""A lot of people put in a tremendous amount of hard work to get us to this day. Today we make good on a promise the Obama Administration made to the residents of this great city: to build back better and stronger.""
Developers HANO, KBK Enterprises of Columbus, Ohio, McCormack Baron Salazar of St. Louis, Mo. and the B.W. Cooper Resident Management Corporation shared in the excitement of officially opening the first 50 homes for families and another 126 homes that are nearly completed. Twenty families have already moved into the new one- to four-bedroom homes - including five former B.W. Cooper residents. By July 2013, there will be 410 homes that will serve nearly 300 low- to moderate-income households and 116 market-rate rental households. This includes 42 accessible homes for mobility impaired residents and nine additional accessible homes for hearing/visual impaired residents. Six of the accessible homes are included in the housing opened today - three physically accessible and three hearing/visual accessible. The estimated investment for this redevelopment was nearly $160 million that came from multiple sources, including HUD, the State of Louisiana, the City of New Orleans, HANO and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
""BW Cooper has been home to thousands of New Orleans families for the last 70 years,"" Mayor Landrieu said. ""And today, we proudly stand here as this community is reborn as the Marrero Commons, giving its residents a modern, safe place to live. It is an improved model for providing affordable housing to a mix of incomes and represents a public-private partnership that brings together private equity and government resources that will improve the lives of its residents.""
""Marrero Commons serves as model of how public housing can be responsibly rebuilt into a quality mixed income community. Shelter is a basic human need, and this project will help families in Central City have access to quality, affordable housing,"" Sen. Landrieu said. ""I commend HUD, the state of Louisiana, city of New Orleans and the developer for their work on this essential project.""
""Today we celebrate another major milestone for our residents as we welcome Marrero Commons to the HANO community,"" said HUD-appointed Administrative Receiver David Gilmore. ""This site will always carry the history of B.W. Cooper but with a modern, Victorian and classical style, and amenities that our residents have wanted and deserved for many years. The project also represents a major accomplishment for many others in New Orleans as B.W. Cooper continues to pave the way for residents to speak up and stand firm on contract accountability, leveraging jobs and training opportunities on HANO construction sites.""
The new development will include a management office and business center for the B.W. Cooper Resident Management Corporation, which has been instrumental in keeping former residents informed and offers supportive services to former residents and a day-care for the community.
The redevelopment of B.W. Cooper and Lafitte, another one of the Big Four public housing communities that Hurricane Katrina severely damaged, were in jeopardy prior to the Obama Administration due to the fall of the housing market and economic downturn, which led to significant construction delays. As a result, the developers were at risk of losing the Gulf Opportunity (GO) Zone tax-credits that are used to build affordable housing to revitalize communities. Thankfully, with the support of many, Congress approved an extension of the construction deadlines allowing for the redevelopment of these two communities.
Marrero Commons was named B.W. Cooper at the time of Hurricane Katrina, but began as Calliope Project when 1,474 public housing units were built between 1942 and 1954. By the time Hurricane Katrina struck in 2005, many of the units were unoccupied and in desperate need of repair - with less than 963 units occupied. The units that remained were further damaged by Hurricane Katrina and water as a result of flooding in the aftermath of Katrina."
05/04/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-078.cfm,Obama Administration Releases April Housing Scorecard,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of the Treasury today released the April edition of the Obama Administration's Housing Scorecard - a comprehensive report on the nation's housing market. Data in the April Housing Scorecard show some promising signs of stability, though the overall outlook remains mixed. Mortgage delinquencies have declined for four consecutive months and remain substantially below year ago levels, while sales of existing homes in the first quarter were 5.3 percent higher than one year ago. Data on home prices were soft in many mortgage markets, though adjusting for the traditionally slow winter months reveals the first uptick in prices since April 2011. The full report is available online at www.hud.gov/scorecard.
HUD Assistant Secretary Raphael Bostic said, ""We're making important progress in providing relief to homeowners under the Obama Administration's programs. With fewer borrowers falling behind on their mortgages and almost half a million families taking advantage of our enhanced Home Affordable Refinance Program - standing to save on average $2,500 per year - it's clear that the Administration's efforts continue to provide significant positive benefits."" Bostic continued, ""But with so many homeowners still struggling to pay their mortgages or move into more sustainable loans, we cannot rest on our laurels. That is why we are asking the Congress to approve the President's refinancing proposal so that more homeowners can receive assistance.""
""The Administration's programs have helped millions of homeowners achieve sustainable mortgage assistance to prevent foreclosure,"" said Treasury Assistant Secretary for Financial Stability Tim Massad. ""The standards these programs have created continue to prompt the mortgage industry to provide improved outcomes for homeowners more broadly.""
The April Housing Scorecard features key data on the health of the housing market and the impact of the Administration's foreclosure prevention programs, including:
The Administration's recovery efforts continue to help millions of families deal with the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. More than 5.9 million modification arrangements were started between April 2009 and the end of March 2012 - including more than 1.8 million Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) trial modification starts and more than 1.3 million FHA loss mitigation and early delinquency interventions. The Administration's programs continue to encourage improved standards and processes in the industry, with HOPE Now lenders offering families and individuals more than 2.8 million proprietary mortgage modifications through February. More than 1.1 million homeowner assistance actions were granted through Making Home Affordable. Eligible homeowners entering HAMP continue to demonstrate a high likelihood of long-term success in the program. As of March, more than 990,000 homeowners received a permanent HAMP modification, saving approximately $535 on their mortgage payments each month with a total estimated savings of $12.2 billion to date. Eighty-six percent of homeowners entering the program in the last 21 months have received a permanent modification, with an average trial period of 3.5 months. After six months in the program, more than 94 percent of homeowners remain in their HAMP permanent modification. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)'s Mortgage Metrics Report (www.occ.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2012/nr-occ-2012-55.html) for the Fourth Quarter of 2011 found that HAMP modifications continue to exhibit lower delinquency and re-default rates than industry modifications.

05/07/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-077.cfm,HUD Launches Overhaul of Consolidated Planning Process,"WASHINGTON - It used to be that the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development would require more than 1,200 cities, counties and states to undergo a paper-based, time-intensive and costly planning process as a condition of receiving billions of dollars in federal funding. No more. Today, HUD is launching the eCon Planning Suite (www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqZPDzx8cIM&feature=youtu.be), a set of 21st Century data and technology tools to help communities ensure that scarce federal dollars are targeted to where they are needed most and can achieve the biggest impact.
It is estimated HUD's new approach will save communities at least 65,000 staff hours each year and support communities in need-driven, place-based decision-making that will engage informed public participation and improve community and economic development outcomes.
HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan said, ""We know that in a time of huge budget cuts at the state and local level, it's harder and harder to have the resources to bring that information together. This technology that we're providing is going to be really revolutionary in helping all of our grantees work smarter.""
""For the first time, we have the technology and data available to help communities approach their planning in targeted, data-driven, place-based way,"" said Mercedes Márquez, HUD's Assistant Secretary of Community Planning and Development. ""This is a giant leap forward by providing grantees and the public alike with the tools they need to visualize where federal taxpayer dollars are going and where investment can make a difference.""
HUD's new planning tools will support place-based decision-making and promote public participation and transparency in the discussion over where federal investments ought to be made. The eCon Planning Suite is comprised of three components: an expanded planning database; a powerful new mapping tool, CPD Maps (http://egis.hud.gov/cpdmaps); and an electronic template for submitting the Consolidated Plan.
CPD Maps will allow cities, counties and states to access expanded planning data that will not only help them visualize where they have made federal investments in the past, but will guide them on where to focus their energies in the future down to the Census tract level. In addition, the public will be able to draw on this powerful new mapping tool to argue for public investments in particular neighborhoods.
For the first time ever, HUD is offering the following data through this user-friendly tool, not only to its grantee community but to the public at large:
Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) from the U.S. Census Bureau which describes housing problems and needs of extremely low-, low-, and moderate-income households; American Community Survey (2005-09) offers Census data on population demographics, description of housing stock (cost, condition) and workforce characteristics, such as earnings by sector and travel time to work; Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) from Census describes changes in jobs and labor force over time; Public and Indian Housing Information Center (PIC) from HUD provides information about the characteristics of public housing residents; Continuum of Care Point-in-Time homeless counts from 3,000 cities and counties offer data on the nature and extent of homelessness; and Location data from HUD, U.S. Department of Transportation, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency which displays the location/concentration of CDBG, HOME, HUD Multi-family housing developments, public housing, Section 8 vouchers, DOT data on fixed rail transit stops and FEMA floodplains.
The online Consolidated Plan template is designed to guide grantees through an intuitive planning process driven by the same data the public can access in CPD Maps. Completed plans will be posted on HUD's website in a standard format to allow grantees and the public to compare plans and identify best practices. This collection will form a national library of Consolidated Plans, creating a single place online to read about other local strategies and best practices.
Márquez added, ""By being able to search every plan in the country, we're creating a library of ideas. This is democracy in data. I've been to my fair share of public hearings in the past but never before will people be as empowered with the evidence they need to inform public policy.""
In the past, state and local governments approached the Consolidated Plans more as a compliance and budget exercise than a strategic planning process based on an analysis of market conditions. Many grantees use limited administrative resources to hire expensive consultants to prepare their plans without sufficiently detailed and timely data. As a result, grantees use these plans to focus on annual funding decisions rather than on strategic goals based on needs.
By contrast, HUD's new user-friendly planning template will allow communities to instantly import information about needs and market data from CPD Maps into plans that they will electronically submit to HUD for review. Together, these two web-based tools will significantly reduce grantee's paperwork burden, save time and money, and create a strategic roadmap to target federal funds where they can do the most good.
HUD piloted the eCon Planning Suite in Detroit, MI; New Orleans, LA; San Antonio, TX; City and County of Sacramento, CA; and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Grantees submitting Consolidated Plans on or after November 15, 2012, will be required to use the new template.
What they're saying:
""These new tools that HUD is making available are coming at such a critical time. When every dollar matters now more than ever before, these tools allow us to really target in a strategic way the resources that we do have, and then to make sure we're connecting those HUD resources with all of the other parts of the City."" -- Fresno, California Mayor Ashley Swearengin
_____________________
""This tool will allow us to do more need-driven, place-based work where we can actually target what we have to do in the community, what is needed in the community, rather than trying to match funding streams. The data that it will provides real information that can be used for effective planning in the neighborhoods."" -- Houston Mayor Annise D. Parker
_____________________
""I think it allows the state government agencies to be able to look more at a regional basis, which we haven't been able to do as much before. The template and the data were more set up for the local governments. And in this case now, we think we'll be able to look at regional markets, and then local markets within that particular region. It's going to allow us to save some staff time, in creating the plan. It's also going to be much more transparent for the general public, to be able to participate in the process."" -- Aaron Gornstein, Massachusetts Department of Housing and Community Development
_____________________
""Secretary Donovan has done an unbelievable job with his team at HUD in providing technical services, data, and resources and has challenged us to put together a comprehensive plan that breaks down the silos between and amongst all of the different organizations in city government so that we could come up with a unified plan. That helps us plan better, it helps us execute better, and it helps us create a clear vision."" -- New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu
_____________________
""I think that providing the information to community residents - making it available, easily understood, and tied to a planning process about how to spend resources, how to improve community, really democratizes the data and allows for the kind of participation that changes communities."" -- Angela Glover Blackwell, CEO, PolicyLink"

Read a complete project-by-project summary of the programs awarded grants today.
The competitive grants announced today are funded through HUD's Fair Housing Initiatives Program (FHIP). They will be used to enforce the Fair Housing Act through investigation and testing of alleged discriminatory practices, and to educate housing providers, local governments and potential victims of housing discrimination about their rights and responsibilities under the Fair Housing Act. HUD had over $70 million in requests for FHIP, but funded only $41 million.
""It is our continued commitment to ensure that every person has equal access to housing,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""These grants are a cost-effective investment. Cases bolstered by FHIP-funded investigations are more likely to uncover discrimination when it has occurred than cases without such support.""
HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity John Trasviña added, ""We are pleased to provide the only federal grant support to private fair housing enforcement and education. Our partners are essential to ending housing discrimination.""
The categories of grants awarded today are:
Private Enforcement Initiative grants (PEI) - HUD awarded $30 million to help local non-profit fair housing organizations carry out testing and enforcement activities to prevent or eliminate discriminatory housing practices. Education and Outreach Initiative grants (EOI) - HUD awarded $5.9 million to groups that educate the public and housing providers about their rights and responsibilities under federal, state, and local fair housing laws. Fair Housing Organizations Initiative (FHOI) - HUD awarded $5.25 million to help build the capacity and effectiveness of non-profit fair housing organizations, particularly organizations that focus on the rights and needs of underserved groups, such as rural and immigrant populations.

05/10/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-081.cfm,HUD Announces Agreement with Nebraska Landlord to Settle Housing Discrimination Complaint,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has reached a $22,500 settlement agreement with the owner and managers of at Cheyenne Villa Apartments, a 56-unit, HUD-assisted townhome complex in Sydney, Nebraska. The settlement resolves a complaint filed by a resident who uses a wheelchair and walker, who alleged that management the development failed to accommodate her request to transfer to the first available ground-floor unit. The resident also claimed that management denied requests for a parking space and a ramp to ease her access to her unit.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to refuse to make reasonable accommodations that would allow a person with a disability to fully enjoy her home. Similarly, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibits providers of federally-assisted housing from denying housing to or discriminating against persons with disabilities.
""Persons with disabilities aren't asking for special treatment when they request reasonable accommodations,"" said John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Ground-floor rooms, designated parking spaces, and ramps may be necessary for persons with disabilities to conduct everyday activities and gain independence in their daily living. HUD is committed to ensuring that housing providers, federally-assisted and otherwise, live up to their obligation to grant reasonable accommodations to people with disabilities when they are needed.""
The resident alleged that she moved into the complex, she requested a ground-floor unit but was told none were available. She agreed to move in provided she could move to a ground-floor unit when one became available. The resident alleged that when a unit meeting her needs became available, the manager leased it to a staff person who had requested the unit after the resident did. Remaining in the inaccessible unit, the resident alleged that she suffered significant injuries while negotiating the stairs to reach her bedroom and bathroom. Months later, the resident transferred to a unit on the ground floor bedroom but she alleged management continued to refuse her repeated requests for a ramp to ease access to her unit, a parking space for her handicapped-accessible van, and an accessible route from the parking lot to her unit. These access barriers eventually caused the resident to move from the property.
Under the settlement agreement the owner and managers of Cheyenne Villa agree to:
Pay the resident $22,500; Revise reasonable accommodation, modification and transfer policies and designate a Section 504 coordinator for Cheyenne Villa to handle future reasonable accommodation requests; Redesign an accessible unit located on an accessible route, and leading to an accessible parking space, to meet Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards requirements; and Alter the complex's seven designated accessible parking spaces to include curb cuts, and post signage marking the spaces.

In addition, the owner, management agents, and staff will receive two hours of training on the Fair Housing Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973."
05/10/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-082.cfm,"HUD, HUD Inspector General and U.S. Attorney Announce $202 Million Settlement with Deutsche Bank and MortgageIT","Preet Bharara, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Stuart F. Delery, the Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division of the U.S. Department of Justice, Helen Kanovsky, General Counsel of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (""HUD""), and David A. Montoya, Inspector General of HUD, announced today that the United States has settled a civil fraud lawsuit against DEUTSCHE BANK AG, DB STRUCTURED PRODUCTS, INC., DEUTSCHE BANK SECURITIES, INC. (collectively ""DEUTSCHE BANK"" or the ""DEUTSCHE BANK defendants"") and MORTGAGEIT, INC. (""MORTGAGEIT"").
The Government's lawsuit, filed May 3, 2011, sought damages and civil penalties under the False Claims Act for repeated false certifications to HUD in connection with the residential mortgage origination practices of MORTGAGEIT, a wholly-owned subsidiary of DEUTSCHE BANK AG since 2007. The suit alleges approximately a decade of misconduct in connection with MORTGAGEIT's participation in the Federal Housing Administration's (""FHA's"") Direct Endorsement Lender Program (""DEL program""), which delegates authority to participating private lenders to endorse mortgages for FHA insurance. Among other things, the suit accused the defendants of having submitted false certifications to HUD, including false certifications that MORTGAGEIT was originating mortgages in compliance with HUD rules when in fact it was not. In the settlement announced today, MORTGAGEIT and DEUTSCHE BANK admitted, acknowledged, and accepted responsibility for certain conduct alleged in the Complaint, including that, contrary to the representations in MORTGAGEIT's annual certifications, MORTGAGEIT did not conform to all applicable HUD-FHA regulations.
MORTGAGEIT also admitted that it submitted certifications to HUD stating that certain loans were eligible for FHA mortgage insurance when in fact they were not; that FHA insured certain loans endorsed by MORTGAGEIT that were not eligible for FHA mortgage insurance; and that HUD consequently incurred losses when some of those MORTGAGEIT loans defaulted. The defendants also agreed to pay $202.3 million to the United States to resolve the Government's claims for damages and penalties under the False Claims Act. The settlement was approved today by United States District Judge Lewis Kaplan.
Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara stated: ""MORTGAGEIT and DEUTSCHE BANK treated FHA insurance as free Government money to backstop lending practices that did not follow the rules. Participation in the Direct Endorsement Lender program comes with requirements that are not mere technicalities to be circumvented through subterfuge as these defendants did repeatedly over the course of a decade. Their failure to meet these requirements caused substantial losses to the Government - losses that could have and should have been avoided. In addition to their admissions of responsibility, Deutsche Bank and MortgageIT have agreed to pay damages in an amount that will significantly compensate HUD for the losses it incurred as a result of the defendants' actions.""
Acting Assistant Attorney General Stuart F. Delery stated: ""This is an important settlement for the United States, both in terms of obtaining substantial reimbursement for the FHA insurance fund for wrongfully incurred claims, and in obtaining the defendants' acceptance of their role in the losses they caused to the taxpayers.""
HUD General Counsel Helen Kanovsky stated: ""This case demonstrates that HUD has the ability to identify fraud patterns and work with our partners at the Department of Justice and U.S. Attorney's Offices to pursue appropriate remedies. HUD would like to commend the work of the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York in achieving this settlement, which is a substantial recovery for the FHA mortgage insurance fund. We look forward to continuing our joint efforts with the Department of Justice and the SDNY to combat mortgage fraud. The mortgage industry should take notice that we will not sit silently by if we detect abuses in our programs.
HUD Inspector General David A. Montoya stated: ""We expect every Direct Endorsement Lender to adhere to the highest level of integrity and accountability. When the combined efforts and attention of the Department of Justice, HUD, and HUD OIG are focused upon those who fail to exercise such integrity in connection with HUD programs, the end result will be both unpleasant and costly to the offending party.
The following allegations are based on the Complaint and Amended Complaint (the ""Complaint"") filed in Manhattan federal court by the Government in this case:
Between 1999 and 2009, MORTGAGEIT was a participant in the DEL program, a federal program administered by the FHA. As a Direct Endorsement Lender, MORTGAGEIT had the authority to originate, underwrite, and endorse mortgages for FHA insurance. If a Direct Endorsement Lender approves a mortgage loan for FHA insurance and the loan later defaults, the holder of the loan may submit an insurance claim to HUD for the costs associated with the defaulted loan, which HUD must then pay. Under the DEL program, neither the FHA nor HUD reviews a loan before it is endorsed for FHA insurance. Direct Endorsement Lenders are therefore required to follow program rules designed to ensure that they are properly underwriting and endorsing mortgages for FHA insurance and maintaining a quality control program that can prevent and correct any deficiencies in their underwriting. These requirements include maintaining a quality control program, pursuant to which the lender must fully review all loans that go into default within the first six payments, known as ""early payment defaults."" Early payment defaults may be signs of problems in the underwriting process, and by reviewing early payment defaults, Direct Endorsement Lenders are able to monitor those problems, correct them, and report them to HUD. MORTGAGEIT failed to comply with these basic requirements.
As the Complaint further alleges, MORTGAGEIT was also required to execute certifications for every mortgage loan that it endorsed for FHA insurance. Since 1999, MORTGAGEIT has endorsed more than 39,000 mortgages for FHA insurance, and FHA paid insurance claims on more than 3,200 mortgages, totaling more than $368 million, for mortgages endorsed for FHA insurance by MORTGAGEIT, including more than $58 million resulting from loans that defaulted after DEUTSCHE BANK AG acquired MORTGAGEIT in 2007. As alleged in the Complaint, a portion of those losses was caused by the false statements that the defendants made to HUD to obtain FHA insurance on individual loans. Although MORTGAGEIT had certified that each of these loans was eligible for FHA insurance, it repeatedly submitted certifications that were knowingly or recklessly false. MORTGAGEIT failed to perform basic due diligence and repeatedly endorsed mortgage loans that were not eligible for FHA insurance.
The Complaint also alleges that MORTGAGEIT separately certified to HUD, on an annual basis, that it was in compliance with the rules governing its eligibility in the DEL program, including that it conduct a full review of all early payment defaults, as early payment defaults are indicators of mortgage fraud. Contrary to its certifications to HUD, MORTGAGEIT failed to implement a compliant quality control program, and failed to review all early payment defaults as required. In addition, the Complaint alleges that, after DEUTSCHE BANK acquired MORTGAGEIT in January 2007, DEUTSCHE BANK managed the quality control functions of the Direct Endorsement Lender business, and had its employees sign and submit MORTGAGEIT's Direct Endorsement Lender annual certifications to HUD. Furthermore, by the end of 2007, MORTGAGEIT was not reviewing any early payment defaults on closed FHA-insured loans. Between 1999 and 2009, the FHA paid more than $92 million in FHA insurance claims for loans that defaulted within the first six payments.
***
Pursuant to the settlement, MORTGAGEIT and the DEUTSCHE BANK defendants will pay the United States $202.3 million within 30 days of the settlement.
As part of the settlement, the defendants admitted, acknowledged, and accepted responsibility for certain misconduct. Specifically,
MORTGAGEIT admitted, acknowledged, and accepted responsibility for the following:
MORTGAGEIT failed to conform fully to HUD-FHA rules requiring Direct Endorsement Lenders to maintain a compliant quality control program; MORTGAGEIT failed to conduct a full review of all early payment defaults on loans endorsed for FHA insurance; Contrary to the representations in MORTGAGEIT's annual certifications, MORTGAGEIT did not conform to all applicable HUD-FHA regulations; MORTGAGEIT endorsed for FHA mortgage insurance certain loans that did not meet all underwriting requirements contained in HUD's handbooks and mortgagee letters, and therefore were not eligible for FHA mortgage insurance under the DEL program; and MORTGAGEIT submitted to HUD-FHA certifications stating that certain loans were eligible for FHA mortgage insurance when in fact they were not; FHA insured certain loans endorsed by MORTGAGEIT that were not eligible for FHA mortgage insurance; and HUD consequently incurred losses when some of those MORTGAGEIT loans defaulted. The DEUTSCHE BANK defendants admitted, acknowledged, and accepted responsibility for the fact that after MORTGAGEIT became a wholly-owned, indirect subsidiary of DB Structured Products, Inc and Deutsche Bank AG in January 2007: The DEUTSCHE BANK defendants were in a position to know that the operations of MORTGAGEIT did not conform fully to all of HUD-FHA's regulations, policies, and handbooks; One or more of the annual certifications was signed by an individual who was also an officer of certain of the DEUTSCHE BANK defendants; and Contrary to the representations in MORTGAGEIT's annual certifications, MORTGAGEIT did not conform to all applicable HUD-FHA regulations.

• Contrary to the representations in MORTGAGEIT's annual certifications, MORTGAGEIT did not conform to all applicable HUD-FHA regulations;
• MORTGAGEIT endorsed for FHA mortgage insurance certain loans that did not meet all underwriting requirements contained in HUD's handbooks and mortgagee letters, and therefore were not eligible for FHA mortgage insurance under the DEL program; and

The case is being handled by the Office's Civil Frauds Unit. Mr. Bharara established the Civil Frauds Unit in March 2010 to bring renewed focus and additional resources to combating financial fraud, including mortgage fraud.
To date, the Office's Civil Frauds Unit has brought four civil fraud lawsuits against major lenders under the False Claims Act alleging reckless residential mortgage lending. Three of the four cases have settled, and today's settlement represents the third, and largest, settlement. On February 15, 2012, the Government settled its civil fraud lawsuit against CITIMORTGAGE, INC. for $158.3 million. On February 24, 2012, the Government settled its civil fraud suit against FLAGSTAR BANK, F.S.B. for $132.8 million. The Government's lawsuit against ALLIED HOME MORTGAGE CORP. and two of its officers remains pending. With today's settlement, the Government has achieved settlements totaling $493.4 million in the last three months. In each settlement, the defendants have admitted and accepted responsibility for certain conduct alleged in the Government's Complaint. The Office's Civil Frauds Unit is handling all three cases as part of its continuing investigation of reckless lending practices.
The Civil Frauds Unit works in coordination with President Barack Obama's Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force, on which Mr. Bharara serves as a Co-Chair of the Securities and Commodities Fraud Working Group. President Obama established the interagency Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force to wage an aggressive, coordinated, and proactive effort to investigate and prosecute financial crimes. The task force includes representatives from a broad range of federal agencies, regulatory authorities, inspectors general, and state and local law enforcement who, working together, bring to bear a powerful array of criminal and civil enforcement resources. The task force is working to improve efforts across the federal executive branch, and with state and local partners, to investigate and prosecute significant financial crimes, ensure just and effective punishment for those who perpetrate financial crimes, combat discrimination in the lending and financial markets, and recover proceeds for victims of financial crimes.
Mr. Bharara thanked HUD and HUD-OIG for their extraordinary assistance in this case. He also expressed his appreciation for the support of the Commercial Litigation Branch of the U.S. Department of Justice's Civil Division in Washington, D.C.
Assistant U.S. Attorneys Lara K. Eshkenazi, Pierre G. Armand, and Christopher B. Harwood are in charge of the case."

05/15/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-084.cfm,HUD Makes Available $85 Million to Fund Housing for Extremely Low-Income Persons with Disabilities,"WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development makes $85 million available to state housing agencies to provide affordable supportive housing for extremely low-income persons with disabilities. This is the first time in the history of HUD's Section 811 Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities Program that funding will be offered to state housing agencies that meet new eligibility criteria, including having a partnership with a state health and human services and Medicaid agency to provide essential support and services. The Notice of Funding for the Section 811 Project Rental Assistance was posted on Grants.gov today here (www.grants.gov/search/search.do;jsessionid=Nyc1Py1YrSQw2hJ6lyyhywvhRPYvF8YBMlw Mt3NhF951XnJy8L41!64499778?oppId=170818&mode=VIEW).
Entities have until July 31, 2012 to apply for funding, which is expected to provide housing for 2,800 extremely low-income persons with disabilities.
""The reforms the Obama Administration has made to the Section 811 program will strengthen HUD's efforts to provide affordable, supportive housing to thousands of the most vulnerable low-income persons with disabilities,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""HUD and the Department of Health and Human Services are also seizing the opportunity to support innovative state-level strategies to transform and increase the availability of affordable housing, matched with needed services and supports, that will help keep people with disabilities out of institutions and integrated into the community.""
""We are excited about this new opportunity for housing with services for people with disabilities,"" said HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. ""Our collaboration with HUD is critically important to helping people with disabilities lead productive lives as members of their communities. This is a priority for our Department, which is reflected in the recent creation of the Administration for Community Living. This agency provides leadership within HHS and across the federal government to make sure that people with disabilities have the opportunity to live in the community with the right mix of services and supports.""
To ensure this at-risk population gets quality, cost-effective service, HUD and HHS are aligning housing and healthcare services at the state level. Under new eligibility requirements, only state or local housing agencies that are currently administering affordable housing programs are eligible for these funds. In addition, these entities must have established a formal partnership with a state health and human services and Medicaid agency to provide for referrals, tenant selection and perform other casework activities to ensure that individuals with the most critical need receive this supportive housing assistance. The funding must be used for rental assistance only and not for construction or rehabilitation.
""The Section 811 Program is a lifeline for people in the disability community who want to live normal lives in society, but cannot afford the cost of even modest rental housing. These reforms make the program even more significant to improve the lives of thousands more people with long-term disabilities access to services in the community,"" said Andrew Sperling, housing Co-Chair of the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities Housing Task Force.
This round of funding will also target the assistance to ""extremely"" low-income persons with disabilities - those who are at or below 30 percent of Area Median Income (AMI) - and limits to only 25 percent the number of apartments that can be set-aside for supportive housing for persons with disabilities in a building. These measures, and other reforms to the Section 811 program, are the result of the Frank Melville Supportive Housing Investment Act of 2010 - groundbreaking legislation President Obama signed on January 4, 2011 to revitalize and reform the program to improve services to this population."
05/16/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-085.cfm,HUD Studies Show Housing Counseling Helps Families Prepare for Homeownership and Keep the Homes They Have,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today released two reports on the impact of HUD-approved housing counseling has for those families who purchase their first homes and those struggling to prevent foreclosure. In both studies, HUD found housing counseling significantly improved the likelihood homeowners remained in their homes.
Both the pre-purchase counseling and foreclosure counseling studies enrolled clients in the fall of 2009 and early 2010. HUD found that 35 percent of participants became homeowners within 18 months of pre-purchase counseling and only one of those buyers subsequently fell behind in their mortgage payments. The foreclosure counseling study reveals that with a counselor's help, nearly 70 percent of those counseled obtained a mortgage remedy to retain their home, and 56 percent cured their defaults and became current on their mortgages.
""These two studies underscore the need to continue supporting housing counseling programs across this country, especially during this period when families need these services the most,"" said Raphael Bostic, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research. ""The evidence is clear, with a little investment on the front end, we can go a long way toward improving the chances families will buy a home they can afford and sustain their homes in the long run.""
Pre-Purchase Counseling Outcome Study
The ""Pre-Purchase Counseling Outcome Study"" enrolled 573 individuals seeking pre-purchase counseling services in fall 2009 from 15 HUD-funded counseling agencies across the country. The objectives of the study were to examine the characteristics of pre-purchase counseling clients, the types of services they received, and whether and under what circumstances they purchased housing in the 18 months after starting counseling.
While HUD cannot conclude that the study sample is representative of all pre-purchase counseling clients served by the study agencies, this study provides a snapshot of some pre-purchase counseling clients at 15 different housing counseling agencies across the country in the fall of 2009.
The key findings of the study include:
35 percent of the study participants had become homeowners 18 months after seeking pre-purchase counseling. Most purchasers had a FICO score of 620 or higher (71 percent), and were reported as having completed counseling by their housing counselor (72 percent). Only one of the purchasers had fallen at least 30 days behind on mortgage payments 12-18 months after receiving pre-purchase counseling services. Most were motivated to seek counseling to identify homebuyer assistance programs (58 percent) or to obtain down payment or closing cost assistance or to qualify for a specific loan program (58 percent). Study participants were racially and ethnically diverse (52 percent African American, 32 percent White, 16 percent of another race or multi-racial, and 19 percent Hispanic), were more likely to be young (51 percent were under age 35), female (72 percent), have dependents under the age of 18 living with them (57 percent).
• 35 percent of the study participants had become homeowners 18 months after seeking pre-purchase counseling.

These findings suggest that counseling helped a diverse group of low- to moderate-income individuals obtain useful information in connection with preparing to purchase a home and indicate that pre-purchase counseling assists clients make good decisions regarding homeownership and might help to make homeownership more sustainable.
Foreclosure Counseling Outcome Study
HUD's ""Foreclosure Counseling Outcome Study"" involved conducting baseline interviews with 824 foreclosure counseling clients, tracking the housing counseling services they received, and analyzing homebuyer outcomes through an analysis of credit report data. A follow-up telephone survey was conducted approximately 18 months after the foreclosure counseling services were delivered.
About three-quarters of the homeowners who had fallen behind on their payments did so because of a loss of income, and very few had any savings to draw upon to pay missed mortgage payments. The study finds that large shares of counseled homeowners were able to obtain a remedy, retain their home, and become current on their mortgages. These outcomes were much more common among homeowners in the study who sought counseling before becoming delinquent or in the early stages of delinquency (1-3 months).
This study provides information on who accesses counseling services when facing challenges in paying their mortgage loan, what services those clients obtain, and identifies the outcomes the clients experienced in the following 18 months (though it cannot assert that the counseling caused the outcomes). The report's findings include:
Most study participants attempted to contact their servicer when they first fell behind but were unsuccessful in negotiating with their lenders on their own. With a counselor's help, 69 percent of counselees obtained a mortgage remedy, and 56 percent were able to become current on their mortgages. Nearly 70 percent of clients who sought counseling before becoming delinquent were in their home and current on their mortgage payments at the 18-month follow-up period, whereas only 30 percent of clients who were six or more months behind at the time they entered counseling were in their home and current at follow-up.
• Most study participants attempted to contact their servicer when they first fell behind but were unsuccessful in negotiating with their lenders on their own.

The results suggest that counseling can help many homeowners at risk of foreclosure to negotiate and obtain mortgage remedies, and to become current on their mortgage payments. In addition, homeowners in the study who were able to obtain mortgage remedies were more likely to stay in their homes. The HUD study is also one of the few studies that documents housing outcomes in relation to specific counseling services received.

05/21/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-086.cfm,Prestigious HUD Secretary Design Award Goes to Three Model Affordable Housing Developments,"WASHINGTON - Three affordable housing developments are the recipients of the coveted HUD Secretary's Housing and Community Design Award, each recognized for excellence in residential housing design. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the American Institute of Architects (AIA) selected Richardson Apartments in San Francisco, California; Bud Clark Commons in Portland, Oregon and Boston Public Library, Mattapan Branch in Boston, Massachusetts for a new generation of affordable housing.
General Deputy Assistant Secretary Jean Lin Pao presented the awards over the weekend in a special ceremony during the 2012 AIA National Convention and Design Exposition in Washington.
""Building something that reaches the height of both form and function begins on the drawing board,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan, himself a trained architect. ""These developments prove that innovative and thoughtful designs play an essential role in creating sustainable communities where everyone wants to call home.""
The 2012 HUD Secretary's Housing and Community Design Award recipients are:
For Excellence in Affordable Housing Design: Drs. Julian and Raye Richardson Apartments: San Francisco, California (Submitting Architect: David Baker)
This award recognizes architecture that demonstrates overall excellence in terms of design in response to both the needs and constraints of affordable housing. In the heart of San Francisco, the project remediates the site of a collapsed freeway. As a mixed-use Single Room Occupancy building, it provides 120 permanent supportive studio apartments for formerly homeless residents, many of whom have mental and physical disabilities. The design is responsive to their needs, balancing independence with security, maximizing a constricted site to meet program needs, and creating attractive homes and community spaces. This five-story structure draws inspiration from its surroundings, both standing out and fitting in with the neighborhood fabric. Focus on the natural beauty of materials — zinc, concrete, and salvaged wood — and on the iconic corner, entry, and shared spaces has created a building with a strong identity and sense of place. A landscaped courtyard, second-level deck, and roof garden provide social opportunities and address community concerns about loitering. Well-lit sidewalks, permeable paving, plantings, and bike racks make for a safe, active addition to the streetscape. The retail corner is to house a social-service bakery/café that will offer jobs and job training to residents.
For Creating Community Connections: Bud Clark Commons: Portland, Oregon (Submitting Architect: Dave Otte)
This award recognizes projects that incorporate housing within other community amenities for the purpose of either revitalization or planned growth. Through a combination of low-income housing tax credits, urban renewal funding, and HUD Recovery Act dollars, Bud Clark Commons, a service and shelter for the homeless project opened in summer 2011. It is now setting a new standard for services by joining permanent supportive housing and temporary shelter with a community resource center. Bud Clark Commons offers a day center with access to services, a temporary shelter for men, and apartments for homelessadults seeking permanent supportive housing. Centrally located at the gateway to downtown Portland and adjacent to light rail, buses, and an historic train station, this project combines the rigorous programmatic requirements of acoalition lead by the municipal client, a progressive design approach, and sustainable building practices. The building has a LEED Platinum certification from the U.S. Green Building Council, and the energy-efficient technologies are estimated to achieve savings of $60,000 per year. Using the Housing First approach, the mission of Bud Clark Commons is to provide a continuum of services to help transition homeless individuals from an unstable condition to a permanent living arrangement.
For Community-Informed Design: Boston Public Library, Mattapan Branch: Boston,Massachusetts (Submitting Architect: William L. Rawn)
The Community-Informed Design recognizes design that supports physical communities as they rebuild social structures and relationships that may have been weakened by outmigration, disinvestment, and the isolation of inner-city areas. With significant amounts of glass looking onto a major urban street, this stone and brick building creates a strong civic presence that is decidedly open and inviting to the community. The building's interior reflects this same sense of invitation in each of its major spaces. The main Reading Room, with its high ceiling, warm wood shelving, and ""sun grillage,"" creates a welcoming space for adults to work quietly. The Children's Room and Young Adults' Room each provide colorful and active spaces flanking an outdoor courtyard. A Community Room, wrapped in warm wood, allows the library to serve the community beyond library hours. Reflecting the importance of the teenage population to the local community, this library provides the largest young adults' space of any regional public library. Its Young Adults' Room has been designed as an oasis, a lively space with robust technology encouraging heavy use after school and during the weekends."
05/24/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-087.cfm,New Vascular Institute Opens in Buffalo with Help of $100 Million FHA-Insured Mortgage Loan,"WASHINGTON - Kaleida Health today held the grand opening of its new Gates Vascular Institute in Buffalo, New York. The new facility's construction was financed by $100.3 million mortgage made possible through the Federal Housing Administration's (FHA) Section 241 Supplemental Mortgage Insurance Program.
""FHA is helping to build state-of-the-art health care facilities all across the country,"" said Acting FHA Commissioner Carol Galante. ""By lowering the cost of credit, FHA is helping Kaleida Health and other health care systems to use more of their resources to provide quality medical care and create jobs.""
The FHA-insured mortgage loan financed the construction of the new 478,000-square-foot, 10-story, Gates Vascular Institute facility adjacent to Kaleida Health's Buffalo General Medical Center. The building connects to the hospital lobby and includes a new emergency room, 62 extended recovery bays, seven operating rooms, 16 cardiac care unit beds, 15 cardiac catheterization/angioplasty labs, and support space. The new facility also houses research and development facilities, including four floors owned by the State University of New York-Buffalo (UB) for its Clinical and Translational Research Center and a Biosciences Incubator.
The project was initiated to comply with the Berger Commission mandate to develop a new infrastructure that supports comprehensive heart and vascular services in a central location. The total cost is approximately $300 million. Kaleida Health, UB, and grants from New York State provided about $200 million for the project.
By insuring the mortgage loan, FHA enabled Kaleida Health to obtain lower cost financing, saving the system an estimated $40.8 million in interest expense over the life of the loan.
""In helping to make projects like this possible, FHA is not only improving the community's health care, it is also contributing to the area's financial well-being by creating jobs and supporting local economies,"" said Acting Commissioner Galante.
HUD estimates this construction project created more than a thousand full-time jobs and provided an estimated economic stimulus of almost $270 million to the community. Now that it is completed, it is estimated the project will provide an annual economic benefit of approximately $217 million and support more than 700 jobs throughout the community. HUD's estimates are based on results from an economic model used by public and private institutions to examine a variety of economic development issues.
Kaleida Health is a non-profit, fully integrated, multi-hospital healthcare delivery system located in Buffalo and surrounding suburbs. It operates four hospitals and several other wholly owned subsidiaries and two charitable foundations. Kaleida Health has five existing FHA-insured mortgages totaling $324 million through the Federal Housing Administration's (FHA) Section 242 Hospital Mortgage Insurance Program.
FHA's Section 242 Mortgage Insurance Program for Hospitals provides HUD-insured mortgages made by private lending institutions to finance construction or renovation of acute care hospitals including major equipment needed to operate the facility. The eligible applicants can be public, proprietary, or nonprofit hospitals certified by the responsible State agency."

The resident who filed the complaint with HUD alleged that because of the non-working elevators, she was forced to climb up and down four flights of stairs when leaving and returning to her home, aggravating her mobility disability.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful for landlords to deny persons with disabilities equal opportunities to use and enjoy their homes.
""For persons with physical disabilities who live in multi-level buildings, having access to working elevators is essential for them to live their lives fully and independently,"" said John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""This settlement ensures they have access and that the condominium meets its fair housing responsibilities.""
The Agreement comes after the resident alleged that the condominium association refused to repair any of the four elevators in her building during the month of March 2011. The resident further alleged that the inoperative elevators limited the activities of other residents and visitors with mobility disabilities. Isleta Marina consists of 380 apartments in two high-rise towers, each with 11 floors.
Under the terms of the Agreement, the Condominium Association will replace four of the eight elevators in its two towers. In addition, the Association will issue a formal apology to the resident, and have all staff undergo fair housing training."
05/31/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-091.cfm,"Obama Administration Working to Close Racial, Ethnic Gap on Asthma","WASHINGTON - Today U.S. federal agencies unveiled the Coordinated Federal Action Plan to Reduce Racial and Ethnic Asthma Disparities. White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) Chair Nancy Sutley, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lisa P. Jackson, Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) Kathleen Sebelius and Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Shaun Donovan discussed the new plan during an event at Town Hall Education Arts Recreation Campus (THEARC), which houses The Boys and Girls Club of Greater Washington along with other community groups.
Nearly 26 million Americans are affected by this chronic respiratory disease, including 7 million children, especially minority children and children with family incomes below the poverty level. Asthma rates of African American children are currently at 16 percent, while 16.5 percent of Puerto Rican children suffer from the chronic respiratory disease, more than double the rate of Caucasian children in the United States. The annual economic cost of asthma, including direct medical costs from hospital stays and indirect costs such as lost school and work days, amounts to approximately $56 billion.
""The numbers don't lie: Asthma disproportionately impacts low-income minority families which is why we must do everything we can to ensure all children have a healthy place to call home,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""Today's announcement will help the federal government support the development of innovative new approaches to prevent and control asthma.""
""Across America we see low-income and minority children and families at a disproportionately higher risk for asthma and respiratory illnesses. Air pollution and other challenges are having serious health effects, which compound economic challenges through medical bills and missed school and work days,"" said EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson. ""As the mother of a child with asthma, I know what it means for our children to have clean and healthy air to breathe. This Action Plan enables federal agencies and our partners to work more collaboratively and comprehensively on tackling a major health threat, so that we can protect all Americans, no matter what community they call home.""
""Low-income and minority communities often face an unacceptable burden of pollution in this country, diminishing their economic potential and threatening the health of millions of American families,"" said Nancy Sutley, Chair of the White House Council on Environmental Quality. ""As we close National Asthma Awareness Month today, the President's Administration is standing behind his commitment to integrating environmental justice into the missions of federal agencies, promoting clean air and healthy communities, and ensuring this really is a country of equal opportunity for all.""
""The report is a blueprint for how we can work together to reduce asthma disparities and help ensure children with asthma get the right care with the right support,"" said Secretary Sebelius. ""One key factor that is so critical to controlling a child's asthma is access to health care. Uninsured people with asthma are less likely to take the preventive medicine they may need to keep their condition under control, making them more likely to suffer an attack. That's why we are focused on expanding access to care.""
The action plan will coordinate efforts to improve asthma management and prevention:
Reduce barriers to asthma care: Ensure that the populations most severely impacted by asthma receive evidence-based comprehensive care, which includes access to medical services, education and environmental interventions. Build local capacity: Enhance capacity to deliver integrated, community-based asthma care systems. Target services: Identify the children, families and communities most impacted by asthma disparities. Accelerate prevention efforts: Increase understanding of the cause or causes of asthma and test interventions that may prevent the onset of asthma.

The developer challenge was launched last March by the VA, in collaboration with the Departments of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), HHS, and the Jon Bon Jovi Soul Foundation, which operates the JBJ Soul Kitchen - the community restaurant in Monmouth County, N.J., where competing apps will now be tested. The Project REACH developer challenge called for an online and web application that would provide real-time info to connect service providers who aid the homeless.
""To achieve our goal to end Veteran homelessness, it is vitally important that we capitalize on innovative ideas from the public and private sector. The developer community has responded quickly and creatively to harness technology to meet the needs of homeless Veterans and their providers,"" said Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric K. Shinseki. ""I am grateful for their hard work on behalf of the Nation's homeless Veterans.""
Today's five finalists will receive a $10,000 cash prize and will now pilot their mobile applications at JBJ Soul Kitchen (a community kitchen where diners cover the cost of their meals either through donation or volunteer service). These easy-to-use mobile/web applications have been judged on their ability to update information about housing and shelter near JBJ Soul Kitchen. Additionally, finalists have been able to display information about local VA services, employment support, crisis hotlines and local legal assistance resources.
Ultimately, the $25,000 prize will be awarded to the developer whose app is determined to be scalable on a national level and enables health clinics, food kitchens, housing services and shelters to update the availability of key services automatically online. The winning app will collect, map, and electronically distribute that information for communities across the nation. Throughout the challenge, requirements and performance criteria have been made available at www.challenge.gov.
""We all use smartphones, tablets, or laptops to check the score of a game or to text our friends,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""These bright minds will develop a tool that can actually connect homeless veterans with the help they need to move beyond a life on the streets.""
""Every American should have a home, and although we've made progress in our battle against homelessness, there's more work to do,"" said HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, chair of the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness. ""With the help of the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Jon Bon Jovi Foundation, we are using innovative technology to help homeless people and their families get resources they need - such as health care, a bed to sleep in, and food to eat.""
""The genesis of this Challenge occurred at the Soul Kitchen last winter when we saw the need for a simple, user-friendly, comprehensive application that would allow us to direct our diners to other resources in the community. We found the VA, HUD and HHS to be of like mind. Collectively, these organizations represent a cumulative wealth of information and now these five finalists have suggested platforms that could tie it all together in real time. They deserve our thanks and congratulations,"" said Jon Bon Jovi, musician and Chairman of the JBJ Soul Foundation.

One out of every six men and women in our nation's homeless shelters are Veterans, and Veterans are 50 percent more likely to fall into homelessness compared to other Americans.

06/06/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-093.cfm,Obama Administration Releases May Housing Scorecard,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of the Treasury today released the May edition of the Obama Administration's Housing Scorecard - a comprehensive report on the nation's housing market. Data in the May Housing Scorecard show promise as indicators continue to show signs of stability, though officials caution that the overall outlook remains mixed. Sales of existing homes rose 2.4 percent in April, increasing in every region of the U.S. In addition, the inventory of newly constructed houses increased for the first time since April 2007. Since sales outpaced inventory levels, the supply of homes on the market dipped to 5.1 months from 5.2 months in March and a peak of 12.2 months in January 2009. Distressed sales remain a key factor, however, as the impact of serious delinquencies and underwater mortgages continue to temper market gains. The full report is available online at www.hud.gov/scorecard.
HUD Acting Assistant Secretary Erika Poethig said, ""This month's indicators show promise - more than 180,000 borrowers took advantage of our enhanced Home Affordable Refinance Program in the last quarter alone and foreclosure starts are declining as more homeowners secure mortgage relief - but with so many households still struggling to make ends meet it's clear that we have more work ahead."" Poethig continued, ""That is why we are asking the Congress to approve the President's refinancing proposal so that more homeowners can receive assistance.""
Included in this month's Making Home Affordable Program Report (www.treasury.gov/initiatives/financial-stability/results/MHA-Reports/Pages/default.aspx) are detailed assessments for the largest mortgage servicers participating in the program with results from the first quarter of 2012. The Servicer Assessments - first introduced in June 2011 and published quarterly - have set a benchmark for disclosure around servicer efforts to assist struggling homeowners. The First Quarter 2012 assessments show that the largest servicers continue to demonstrate broad improvement in implementation of the Making Home Affordable Program, and have focused attention on remediating past areas of need identified by Treasury through ongoing program reviews. For the second consecutive quarter, no mortgage servicer was found to be in need of substantial improvement.
""The Administration's programs have established critical standards and accountability for mortgage servicers that have compelled the industry to provide higher quality assistance to struggling homeowners; however, servicers still have more work to do,"" said Treasury Assistant Secretary for Financial Stability Tim Massad. ""This month, expanded eligibility for the Making Home Affordable Program becomes available to help more families benefit from the program's sustainable assistance and homeowner protections.""
Since inception of the Making Home Affordable Program, Treasury has required participating servicers to take specific actions to improve their processes through ongoing program reviews. The Servicer Assessments summarize performance on metrics in three categories of program implementation: identifying and contacting homeowners; homeowner evaluation and assistance; and program reporting, management and governance.
For the first quarter of 2012, three servicers were found to need only minor improvement with respect to the specific metrics evaluated. Six servicers were found to need moderate improvement. All servicers must continue to demonstrate progress and program compliance through ongoing reviews. Treasury continues to retain the right to withhold program incentives from mortgage servicers in future periods if necessary.
The release of the First Quarter 2012 Servicer Assessments coincides with the availability of expanded program eligibility for the Making Home Affordable Program announced by Treasury in January (www.treasury.gov/connect/blog/Pages/Expanding-our-efforts-to-help-more-homeowners-and-strengthen-hard-hit-communities.aspx). The new criteria expand program eligibility to include homeowners with a debt-to-income ratio below 31 percent, properties occupied by a tenant and vacant properties which the borrower intends to rent. As of June 1, 2012, servicers have informed Treasury that they have begun accepting HAMP Tier 2 modification requests from homeowners.
As the Administration continues to push servicers to provide more effective assistance to struggling homeowners, the ongoing recovery of the housing market demonstrates the need for the Administration's continuing efforts. The May Housing Scorecard features key data on the health of the housing market and the impact of the Administration's foreclosure prevention programs, including:
The Administration's foreclosure programs are providing relief for millions of homeowners as the housing market continues to recover from an unprecedented crisis. More than 1.1 million homeowner assistance actions have taken place through the Administration's Making Home Affordable Program, while the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) has offered more than 1.3 million loss mitigation and early delinquency interventions. The Administration's programs continue to encourage improved standards and processes in the industry, with HOPE Now lenders offering families and individuals nearly 2.9 million proprietary mortgage modifications through April. Homeowners entering HAMP demonstrate a high likelihood of long-term success in the program. As of April, more than one million homeowners have received a permanent HAMP modification, saving approximately $535 on their mortgage payments each month, and an estimated $12.7 billion to date. Eighty-six percent of homeowners entering the program in the last 22 months have received a permanent modification, with an average trial period of 3.5 months. Seventy percent of non-GSE customers entering HAMP in recent months have received some form of principal reduction with their modification. Those participating in the HAMP Principal Reduction Alternative (PRA) have seen a median principal reduction of $68,267 - or 31 percent.

Also featured this month is the Administration's Housing Scorecard Regional Spotlight on market strength in Cincinnati, Ohio and surrounding communities. The Cincinnati metro area was one of the hardest hit areas in the nation following the housing market downturn and an area where the Administration's broad approach to stabilizing the housing market has been very active.
""The fragile signs of stability that the national data show for the broader housing market are even more delicate in the Cincinnati market,"" said Poethig. ""The Administration is working hard to help all homeowners who have been hit hard during the crisis and, as this Regional Spotlight shows, our efforts have helped nearly 34,000 Cincinnati households to avoid foreclosure. A modest local economic recovery is underway, but we have much more to do to reach the many households who still face trouble and to help the Cincinnati market recover.""
The bi-monthly Housing Scorecard Regional Spotlight features data on the health of the Cincinnati housing market and impact of efforts to help homeowners at the local level including:
The challenges in the far-spanning Cincinnati housing market have been more severe than those in most areas of the nation, as a high percentage of distressed mortgages and many severely underwater mortgages contribute to continued fragility. Sales of bank-owned properties and short sales remain high at 30 percent of existing home sales in the Cincinnati market compared to 29 percent nationally, which contributes to continued weakness in local home prices. Moreover, 25 percent of mortgages in the Cincinnati area are currently underwater - compared to 23 percent nationally - representing additional homeowners and loans potentially at risk. More than 34,000 Cincinnati households have received mortgage modifications, many directly through Administration programs. Since April 1, 2009 more than 34,000 mortgage assistance interventions have been offered to homeowners in the Cincinnati metropolitan area. Nearly 20,000 interventions were offered through HAMP and the FHA loss mitigation and early delinquency intervention programs. An estimated additional 14,000 proprietary modifications have been offered through HOPE Now Alliance servicers. While some homeowners may have received help from more than one program, the number of times assistance has been offered in the Cincinnati MSA is nearly double the number of foreclosures completed during this period (17,900). The Administration's Hardest Hit Fund and Neighborhood Stabilization Programs have fueled local foreclosure prevention efforts and market stability. Ohio has received approximately $570 million through the Hardest Hit Fund to implement local solutions to mitigate borrower mortgage defaults and address the range of factors that contribute to a family's financial problems. Moreover, approximately $52.7 million has been awarded to five jurisdictions through the Neighborhood Stabilization Program to help purchase or redevelop residential properties and address the effects of abandoned and foreclosed housing. Both programs have helped provide stability to the Cincinnati housing market.

The retrofits by Fourth Street Realty, Inc. must be completed within 90 days.
HUD reached the agreement after two residents who use wheelchairs filed complaints with HUD alleging that a ramp in the building's front entrance was too steep, apartment thresholds were too high for wheelchairs to safely cross, and a basement storage area was inaccessible.
The Fair Housing Act requires that multifamily dwellings designed and constructed for first occupancy after March 1991 be accessible for persons with mobility impairments. It also requires that public and common use areas of a covered property be readily accessible and usable by persons with disabilities.
""Having accessible features in a dwelling is not just a legal requirement. Without these features, people with disabilities struggle to navigate and enjoy the very place they call home,"" said John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD is committed to ensuring that housing developers construct new buildings that meet the accessibility requirements of the Fair Housing Act.""
When Fourth Street Realty, Inc. finished construction and began leasing the property in 2009, it advertised the property to local health care and housing organizations as having ""wheelchair accessible apartments"" and listed a series of amenities, including ""storage and parking."" However, when HUD inspected the property, investigators found several violations of the Fair Housing Act, including an inaccessible front entrance ramp and landing, interior thresholds lacking the appropriate slope to facilitate accessibility, and basement storage units without an accessible route to the building.
The planned retrofits will include a rebuilt front entrance ramp with handrails, an automatic door opener at the front entrance of the property, modified or replaced interior thresholds with proper edge treatments, and a wheelchair accessible lift to the basement storage units. Fourth Street Realty will also pay a total of $5,750 to the two residents who filed complaints, residents of three other units, and the Manchester Transit Authority's ""Public Meeting Access"" program which serves the transportation needs of persons with disabilities."
06/07/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//local/ca/news/pr2012-06-07.cfm,"Bank of America Agrees to Pay More than $160,000 to Settle Maternity Discrimination Claim","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that Bank of America has agreed to pay up to $161,180 to settle allegations that one of the bank's San Jose, California branches refused to refinance the mortgage of an Irvine woman because she was on maternity leave. HUD reached the agreement with Bank of America to resolve a Fair Housing Act complaint that had been filed by the Fair Housing Council of Orange County (FHCOC).
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing discrimination in mortgage lending and real estate-related transactions based on a person's race, color, national origin, religion, sex, family status and disability. Refusing to approve a mortgage loan or provide refinancing because a woman is pregnant or on family leave violates the Fair Housing Act's prohibition against sex and family status discrimination.
""The Fair Housing Act prohibits lenders from denying home loans to women because they are pregnant or on maternity leave,"" said John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Today's settlement follows HUD actions involving other lenders across the country which we will continue until maternity leave discrimination is eliminated.""
The woman told FHCOC, a non-profit fair housing organization funded by HUD, that in December 2009, a Bank of America agent offered her a 5% interest rate for a home refinance loan, with no costs or fees. But in January 2010, after she had applied for the loan and supplied the necessary documents, the bank allegedly refused to process her application because she was on maternity leave. In her complaint, the woman alleged that a bank agent told her that she would have to return to work full-time in order for her loan to be approved. Even after she informed the bank that she received the same rate of pay and benefits while on maternity leave, the bank would not process her application. In March 2010, the bank finally approved the woman's application, but by that time the interest rate on her loan had increased to 5.25%, making each loan payment higher.
A Bank of America official said: ""We regret our treatment of the applicant. We take our Fair Lending responsibilities very seriously and will work with HUD to ensure our customers on maternity leave are treated appropriately during the mortgage application process.""
Under the terms of the Conciliation Agreement, Bank of America will pay $30,000 to the woman, $16,180 to her attorney, and $15,000 to FHCOC. The bank will also create a $100,000 Compensation Fund to pay damages to loan applicants or borrowers who may have been denied a loan, subjected to adverse loan terms, or had their loan applications delayed because they were pregnant or on maternity leave. In addition, the bank is requiring all of its loan officers nationwide to complete annual fair lending training.
Anyone who believes that a bank has discriminated against them during the mortgage application process because they were pregnant or on maternity leave should contact HUD at (800) 669-9777 (voice), 800-927-9275 (TTY)"
06/08/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-096.cfm,"HUD to Expand Sale of Troubled Mortgages through Program Designed to Help Borrowers Avoid Costly, Lengthy Foreclosures","CHICAGO - Thousands of borrowers severely delinquent on loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) will have help from a new servicer to explore affordable mortgage solutions or achieve a favorable resolution under an enhanced government note sale program announced today. In a press conference held at the 2012 Clinton Global Initiative America Meeting, U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Shaun Donovan and Acting FHA Commissioner Carol Galante launched the Distressed Asset Stabilization Program, an expansion of an FHA pilot program that allows private investors to purchase pools of mortgages headed for foreclosure and charges them with helping to bring the loan out of default.
""While our housing market has momentum we haven't seen since before the crisis, there are still thousands of FHA borrowers who are severely delinquent today - who have exhausted their options and could lose their homes in a matter of months,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""With this program, we will increase by as much as ten times the number of loans available for purchase while making it easier for borrowers to avoid foreclosure. Finding ways to bring these loans out of default not only helps the borrower, but helps the entire neighborhood avoid the disinvestment and decline in value that accompanies a distressed property.""
The FHA note sales program began as a pilot in 2010 and has resulted in the purchase of more than 2,100 single family loans to date. A servicer can place a loan into the loan pool if the following criteria are met:
The borrower is at least six months delinquent on their mortgage; The servicer has exhausted all steps in the FHA loss mitigation process; The servicer has initiated foreclosure proceedings; and The borrower is not in bankruptcy.
• The borrower is at least six months delinquent on their mortgage;
• The servicer has exhausted all steps in the FHA loss mitigation process;
• The servicer has initiated foreclosure proceedings; and
• The borrower is not in bankruptcy.
Under the program, FHA-insured notes are sold competitively at a market-determined price generally below the outstanding principal balance. Once the note is purchased, foreclosure is delayed for a minimum of six additional months as the borrower gets direct help from their servicer to help to find an affordable solution to avoid foreclosure. The investor purchases the loan at a discount and then takes additional steps to help the borrower avoid default, whether through modifying their loan terms or helping them through a short sale, in order to maximize the return on the sale.
""The Distressed Asset Stabilization Program offers a better shot for the struggling homeowner and lower losses to the FHA,"" said Acting FHA Commissioner Carol Galante. ""By addressing the growing back log of distressed mortgages, FHA is helping to mitigate the negative effects of the foreclosure process as part of the Administration's broader commitment to community stabilization.""
Beginning with the September 2012 scheduled sale, FHA will increase the number of loans available for purchase from approximately 1,800 each year to a quarterly rate of up to 5,000, and add a new neighborhood stabilization pool to encourage investment in communities hardest hit by the foreclosure crisis.
In an additional safeguard against blight, HUD will require that no more than 50 percent of the loans within a purchased pool become real-estate owned (REO) properties and - if the servicer and borrower are unable to bring the loan out of default - that the servicer hold the loan for at least three years.
""Currently, FHA's inventory of REO properties available for sale is at its lowest level since FY 2009,"" added Galante. ""At the same time, the inventory of seriously delinquent loans is near an all time high. With many neighborhoods still fighting to recover from the housing crisis, going upstream will allow us to help more borrowers before they go through foreclosure and their homes ever come into the REO portfolio."""
06/12/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-097.cfm,"HUD Awards $500,000 to Study Choice Neighborhoods Grants","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today awarded $500,000 in research grants to four entities to study HUD's Choice Neighborhoods (CN) Program, a centerpiece of HUD's neighborhood revitalization efforts to transform distressed neighborhoods into sustainable, mixed-income neighborhoods with the affordable housing, safe streets and good schools.
""HUD expects the Choice Neighborhoods Program will transform poverty-stricken neighborhoods and produce expanded opportunities for the families who live there,"" said Erika Poethig, HUD Acting Assistant Secretary for the Office of Policy Development & Research. ""These grants demonstrate our commitment to sound research to help gauge the program's overall success and cultivate the most promising approaches to making the greatest possible impact.""
The following entities received the funding:
Portland State University - $76,948: Portland State University will collect and analyze data on the characteristics of the neighborhoods CN Planning grantees are targeting. This work will describe the neighborhoods' baseline characteristics before any CN planning activity occurs, and will determine whether there are specific conditions that put a neighborhood in position for a sustainable revitalization effort. This research will also include unsuccessful applicants for CN Planning grants, to test how the baseline characteristics differ between neighborhoods that were and were not selected for funding.
Washington State Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS) - $198,027: DSHS will develop an advanced administrative database that combines records from the Seattle Housing Authority and DSHS, providing information about the residents of Seattle's Yesler Terrace public housing community, the surrounding neighborhood, and similar residents living in other neighborhoods. Having this information for different study groups will eventually allow rigorous quasi-experimental research on the impact of the CN investments in Seattle.
University of California, Berkeley - $131,148: This research project will quantify the major investments made by public, non-profit, and private for-profit organizations in the Eastern Bayview neighborhood in San Francisco, and examine how this measure of investment activity relates to the neighborhood's improvement over time. The research will also focus specifically on the challenge of bringing healthy food options to the neighborhood.
International City/County Management Association (ICMA) - $93,877: ICMA will create case studies of the experiences of three communities using CN Planning grants to develop a transformation plan. The case studies will focus on the role of the local government and the importance of effective collaboration between the many stakeholders involved in planning for neighborhood revitalization. These case studies will be for Salisbury, N.C.; Suffolk, Va.; and Norfolk, Va. By focusing on small and medium sized cities, this research will complement more common studies of neighborhood revitalization efforts in large cities.
HUD's Choice Neighborhoods Demonstration Small Research Grants Program offers an opportunity for nonprofit and for profit organizations, foundations, think tanks, consortia, and colleges, universities to develop and implement small scale research projects that build upon the larger Choice Neighborhoods Demonstration research project.
Choice Neighborhoods is a centerpiece of the Obama Administration's interagency Neighborhood Revitalization Initiative - a collaboration between the Departments of Housing and Urban Development, Education, Justice, Treasury and Health and Human Services - to support the ability of local leaders from the public and private sectors and attract the private investment needed to transform distressed neighborhoods into sustainable, mixed-income neighborhoods with the affordable housing, safe streets and good schools.
Choice Neighborhoods, which includes CN Planning grants and CN Implementation grants, builds on the successes and lessons learned from HUD's HOPE VI Program. CN Planning grants provide funding to build the capacity a community needs to prepare to undertake a successful neighborhood transformation to create a ""choice neighborhood."" These grants enable communities create a comprehensive Transformation Plan, or road map, to transforming distressed public and/or assisted housing within a distressed community. This Federal support provides a significant incentive for the local community to take critical steps to create viable neighborhood transformation. CN Implementation grants provide funding for communities that have already undertaken the comprehensive local planning process and are ready to move forward with their Transformation Plan to redevelop the targeted housing and neighborhood.
Since 2010, HUD awarded 30 CN Planning grants and six CN Implementation grants. HUD will announce 2012 CN Implementation grants later this year."

The announcement is part of a series of initiatives delivered through the White House Rural Council (www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/rural-council). The Council was launched by President Obama last August to help create jobs and expand opportunities in rural communities.
The three agencies signed a Memorandum of Understanding that will offer up to $200,000 to nonprofit and/or tribal financial institutions serving colonias for direct investment and technical assistance focusing on affordable housing, small businesses, and community facilities. Colonias are communities along the U.S./Mexico border struggling with chronic poverty, the lack of drinking water, inadequate sewage systems, and a shortage of decent, safe and sanitary housing.
The lack of stable funding and capacity among the organizations serving the colonias is a major barrier in the effectiveness of federal programs. The Border Initiative will assist local financial institutions improve their capacity to raise capital, increase lending, and boost investment it in their communities. Strengthening local community development lenders and investors will also widen the channels through which larger private institutions and federal agencies can reach potential home owners, renters, business owners, facilities operators and service providers who need their support. Depending upon the results of the Border Initiative and availability of resources, the agencies may consider extending this collaboration to other persistent poverty regions of the country.
Resources offered through the Border Initiative will support activities such as loan or investment capital, loan loss reserves, program staff costs, information systems, market studies, portfolio analyses and business planning. Applicants may propose to expand lending or investing in affordable housing, small business and/or community facilities that benefits colonias communities or the current low income residents of colonias. Applicants may also propose to secure new sources of capital for existing activities such as these.
HUD will:
Make grants available to community development lenders and investors serving colonias and colonias residents, pursuant to a Notice of Fund Availability. Evaluate the outcomes of the Border Initiative in relation to other HUD grant-making approaches.

06/13/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-099.cfm,"HUD, VA to Provide Additional Housing and Support for Homeless Vets","WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric K. Shinseki announced today that HUD will provide an additional $2.5 million to public housing agencies to supply housing and case management for 380 homeless veterans. (See list below.) This funding is part of a total $75 million the Obama Administration is investing this year to house 10,450 homeless veterans who might otherwise be living on the streets.
The permanent supportive housing assistance announced today is provided through HUD's Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing Program (HUD-VASH), a program administered by HUD, VA, and local housing agencies to provide permanent housing with case management and other supportive services for homeless veterans across the country.
""Our latest count shows that homelessness among veterans has fallen by 12 percent,"" said Donovan. ""Thanks to HUD, VA and local public housing authorities working collaboratively with VA medical centers, we're offering homes, along with critically needed supportive services, to veterans who sacrificed themselves for all Americans.""
""Through HUD-VASH we will accomplish our goal - to prevent and eliminate veteran homelessness by 2015 and improve quality of life for veterans,"" said VA Secretary Shinseki. ""No one, especially veterans who have faithfully served our country, should become homeless. VA is committed to providing veterans and their families with access to affordable housing and medical services that will help them get back on their feet.""
This funding to local housing agencies is part of the Obama Administration's commitment to end Veteran and long-term chronic homelessness by 2015. Opening Doors: Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness (www.usich.gov/PDF/FactSheetVeterans.pdf) serves as a roadmap for how the federal government will work with State and local agreements to confront the root causes of homelessness, especially among former servicemen and women. HUD's annual ""point in time"" estimate of the number of homeless persons and families for 2011 found that veteran homelessness fell by nearly 12 percent (or 8,834 people) since January 2010.
Earlier this year, HUD and VA announced $72.6 million in HUD-VASH funding to public housing agencies in all 50 states and the District of Columbia to house more than 10,000 homeless veterans. VA Medical Centers (VAMC) provide supportive services and case management to eligible homeless veterans.
VAMCs work closely with homeless veterans then refer them to public housing agencies for these vouchers, based upon a variety of factors, most importantly the duration of the homelessness and the need for longer term more intensive support to obtain and maintain permanent housing. The HUD-VASH program includes both the rental assistance the voucher provides and the comprehensive case management that VAMC staff provides.
Veterans participating in the HUD-VASH program rent privately owned housing and generally contribute no more than 30 percent of their income toward rent. VA offers eligible homeless veterans clinical and supportive services through its medical centers across the U.S., Guam and Puerto Rico."
06/14/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-100.cfm,HUD Awards $5 Million through New Tenant Resource Network,"WASHINGTON - In an effort to help low-income tenants receiving Section 8 project-based rental assistance and to preserve affordable housing, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today awarded nearly $5 million to 15 nonprofit organizations through HUD's new Tenant Resource Network (TRN). The purpose of TRN is to make grants to qualified nonprofit organizations to assist, inform, educate and engage tenants living in certain Section 8-assisted properties at risk of losing affordability protections or project-based rental assistance.
""The Tenant Resource Network is designed to help working families who are at greatest risk of being priced out of their rental market,"" said Carol Galante, HUD's Acting Assistant Secretary for Housing. ""The whole purpose of this program is to empower families living in HUD-assisted housing, giving them the information and options they need to stay in their homes.""
HUD is awarding grants to the following nonprofit tenant assistance organizations (see attached grant summaries):
One goal of the TRN program is to assist tenants living in project-based Section 8 housing regarding their rights, responsibilities and options when a property owner 'opts-out' the program, pre-pays their mortgage, or repeatedly fails to meet HUD's housing standards. The second purpose of the program is preservation of HUD-assisted affordable housing by engaging tenants in efforts to preserve eligible properties as affordable housing.
TRN is a new program developed under the authority of Section 514 of the Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997 (MAHRA). The TRN Program targeted certain Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) which include a high proportion of TRN-eligible housing units."
06/14/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-101.cfm,"HUD Announces $13.5 Million in ""Sweat Equity"" Grants","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today awarded $13.5 million in ""sweat equity"" grants to produce at least 741 affordable homes for low-income working families and individuals. Funded through HUD's Self-Help Homeownership Opportunity Program (SHOP), the grants awarded today, along with the labor contributed by these families, will significantly lower the cost of homeownership.
""These grants are about families devoting their own sweat and labor into their American Dream,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""With the help of these organizations and armies of volunteers, families are able to see that dream become reality brick by brick.""
The following organizations will receive SHOP funds:
HUD's SHOP program provides federal grants on a competitive basis to national and regional nonprofit organizations and consortia that have experience in administering self-help homeownership housing programs. The SHOP grants must be used to purchase land and make necessary infrastructure improvements, which may not exceed an average $15,000 per dwelling unit. Leveraged funds must be used for the construction or rehabilitation of these homeownership units. Grantees may carry out activities directly and/or distribute SHOP funds to local nonprofit affiliates that will develop the SHOP units, select homebuyers, coordinate the homebuyer sweat equity and volunteer efforts, and assist in the arrangement of interim and permanent financing for the homebuyers.
All newly constructed units will receive certification as an ENERGY STAR Qualified New Home and all appliances and products or features which are installed or replaced will be ENERGY STAR qualified. Water usage products will bear the WaterSense label. Many units will also have ""Green"", ""Healthy Homes"" and ""Universal Design"" features.
Homebuyer households of two or more persons must contribute a minimum of 100 hours of sweat equity on the construction of their homes and/or the homes of other homebuyers participating in the local self-help housing program. Single person households must contribute a minimum of 50 hours of sweat equity. Reasonable accommodations are made for homebuyers with disabilities. Sweat equity involves participation in the construction of the housing, which can include, but is not limited to, assisting in the painting, carpentry, trim work, drywall, roofing and siding for the housing. Labor is also contributed by community volunteers. The sweat equity and labor contributions by the homebuyers and volunteers significantly reduce the cost of the housing.
Most of the families who benefit from SHOP homes are first-time homeowners so the new home fulfills a lifelong dream. The organizations that receive the SHOP grants also ensure the new homeowners can afford to stay in their homes for the long term to provide a safe, healthy, stable environment to raise children, access jobs and build community.
Since 1996, the SHOP program has provided more than $373 million in federal grants that, together with significant leveraged funds and numerous volunteer hours, are transforming lives and neighborhoods through the production of over 28,000 units of affordable, homeownership housing.

06/14/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-102.cfm,Housing Authorities Across U.S. Gearing Up for Father's Day,"WASHINGTON - For the second consecutive year, hundreds of public housing authorities across the country are gearing up to host free events to celebrate Father's Day. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) reports more that nearly 300 local agencies answered HUD's call to host Father's Day 2012, compared to approximately 200 agencies during last year's inaugural event. The purpose of Saturday's celebration is to celebrate fatherhood, family and to support dads in staying connected with their children. See which housing authorities are hosting events in your area.
""For a second year, housing authorities are being creative in an effort to connect fathers and their children,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan, himself a father of two. ""Whether it's a Friday night dinner with dad or a Saturday basketball tournament, the events speak to this year's theme, 'Reconnecting Families and Dads.'""
Local housing authorities will use Saturday, June 16th - the day before the actual holiday - to celebrate fatherhood and the importance of dads being connected with their children who live in public housing or surrounding communities. The events have a two-fold purpose: Offering activities for fathers and their children and connecting these men to economic development resources.
The local offices of other federal agencies, including the U.S. Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, Agriculture, Education and Justice, are getting ready to offer on-site information and services such as employment resources, healthcare consultation and legal counseling this weekend. In some cities, participants will meet athletes from the NFL and NBA, who will join in on the fun.
Nearly 300 housing authorities in 33 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands will participate in Fathers Day 2012 and have partnered with other organizations the Boys & Girls Club of America, Legal Services Corporation and the National Fatherhood Initiative (www.fatherhood.org/Page.aspx?pid=192).
(NFI), an organization created in 1994 to raise the awareness of the importance of fathers. Together, these groups are delivering a clear message — America needs dads.
According to U.S. Census data, 24 million American children live in a home without a father. Also, NFI says children in homes absent a father are five times more likely to be poor; and are more likely to drop out of school or be incarcerated.
HUD's national Father's Day 2012 campaign is in part modeled after the New York City Housing Authority 2010 Fatherhood Initiative, which hosted a day-long event in all five of its boroughs to kick off ongoing economic development, parenting workshops, tutoring and bonding activities for fathers and children.

""In March, President Obama announced the creation of the White House Council on SC2, which is all about furthering the initiative's charge to develop creative ways to improve the way the Federal government engages locally and we are seeing results being delivered,"" said Mark Zuckerman, Deputy Director of the Domestic Policy Council. ""These new features of SC2 provide local governments with flexible tools and resources to build upon their foundation for a brighter economic future. We look forward to continuing our place-based work to revitalize communities and drive innovation in America's cities.""
The U.S. Economic Development Administration (EDA) will launch a groundbreaking $6 million SC2 Challenge to help economically challenged cities leverage innovative strategies to spur local economic and job growth. This economic development challenge, the first of its kind sponsored by a federal agency, will start with the competitive selection of six cities, one in each of EDA's regions. These winning cities will then conduct a challenge in which teams will compete to provide the city with a comprehensive innovative economic development plan. The cities will each receive investments of up to $1 million to award as prizes to the winning teams.
""The SC2 Challenge is a critical pillar of the Obama Administration's SC2 initiative, which is working to connect government resources directly with communities to create jobs, improve the business climate, and address local and regional challenges,"" said Erskine. ""This competition is an important intergovernmental collaboration and will empower local leaders to identify and leverage bottom up strategies to strengthen their local economic ecosystems.""
In addition, HUD is releasing an advance notice of funding availability (NOFA) for public input from stakeholders and municipalities on the SC2 National Resource Network (SC2 Network), which will aggregate public and private resources to provide a broader set of cities, towns and regions access to a single portal for national experts and federal resources. These experts will provide holistic policy and implementation support, particularly on fundamental issues like operational efficiency, a key element to helping communities achieve their visions for economic development and job creation. The Network will work with each government to document their needs and deliver timely assistance to qualifying communities. HUD will use the input to finalize the components included in the final NOFA, which will allocate $5 million to an intermediary organization that will be responsible for administering the services of the SC2 Network.
""HUD and EDA's goal is to maximize the impact that SC2 can have in economically distressed communities, and we are achieving that through the leveraging of our investments in SC2. The six economic development plans that will emerge from the EDA's challenge will create a long term vision of economic prosperity in these places, and the SC2 National Resource Network will be able to not only help cities achieve these visions, but also provide tailored assistance to other cities on demand,"" said Erika Poethig, HUD Acting Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research.
About the EDA's SC2 Visioning Challenge
Winning cities will receive technical support and technology to conduct their own two-phase competitions, to identify and fund economic development plans that meet their specific needs. In the first phase, selected cities will encourage teams of experts in such fields as transportation planning, economic and community development, business incubation, engineering, and others to submit economic development proposals for their city and/or region. In the second phase the finalists from the first round will compete by developing comprehensive strategic economic development plans. The cities—using an expert panel of local and federal officials, academics and policymakers, private-sector and non-profit stakeholders, and community representatives—will award the financial prize to the team with the strongest plan.
The application deadline is July 23. Information about the competition is available at www.eda.gov/SC2Challenge

Bloomberg, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan, Department of Housing Preservation and Development Commissioner Mathew M. Wambua, Housing Development Corporation President Marc Jahr, New York State Homes and Community Renewal Commissioner/CEO Darryl C. Towns, were joined by to cut the ribbon to mark the official opening of the Via Verde affordable housing development located at 700 Brook Avenue and East 156th Street in the South Bronx. Via Verde, a largely City-financed project that blends 151 rental units and 71 co-op units with innovative and sustainable green design elements, was the winning proposal to New York City's first juried design competition for affordable and sustainable housing. The development is also the latest to be completed in the Administration's efforts to rebuild the blighted South Bronx. The Mayor was joined at the announcement by Jonathan Rose Companies President Jonathan F. P. Rose, Phipps Houses President Adam Weinstein, JPMorgan Chase Chief Administrative Officer and Mortgage Banking CEO Frank Bisignano, Congressman Jose E. Serrano, State Senator Ruben Diaz, Sr., Bronx Borough President Rubin Diaz, Jr., and Council Member Maria del Carmen Arroyo.
""Twenty years ago, it was inconceivable that the future of this neighborhood would look as bright as it does today,"" said Mayor Bloomberg. ""No one would have predicted that today there would one day be one of the most innovative, exciting, environmentally sustainable affordable housing developments in the nation - if not the world. The change that has swept through the South Bronx in the last decade challenges the very notions of what is and isn't possible in urban revival. And investment in high-quality affordable housing - made possible by partnerships like the one behind Via Verde - has been the catalyst.""
Via Verde was developed as part of Mayor Bloomberg's New Housing Marketplace Plan. The plan is a multi-billion dollar initiative to finance 165,000 units of affordable housing for half a million New Yorkers by the close of Fiscal Year 2014. For every dollar invested by the City, the plan has leveraged $3.41 in private funding, amounting to a total commitment to date of more than $19.4 billion to fund the creation or preservation of over 130,770 units of affordable housing across the five boroughs. Nearly 40,400 units have been financed in the Bronx, with 7,190 of those units in Bronx Community Board 1 where Via Verde is located.
""Via Verde is a model for what affordable housing ought to be - a platform for opportunity, a source of stability, a building block with which we forge neighborhoods, put down roots, and build the communities that are the engines of our nation's economic growth,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""The New Housing New York Legacy Project and Via Verde represents architects re-engaging in the design of affordable housing, the best practices for environmentally friendly design as well as the wider concept of sustainability through community meetings where stakeholder voices were heard and locally-driven planning efforts were used as a model. And of course, it is inspiring to see a range of funding sources - including HOME funds from HUD - contribute to building more affordable homes as part of Mayor Bloomberg's historic 165,000 unit affordable housing plan.""
""Mayor Bloomberg's New Housing Marketplace Plan is bringing investment and jobs to neighborhoods all throughout New York City,"" Deputy Mayor for Economic Development Robert K. Steel said. ""Via Verde is a new landmark in the South Bronx, demonstrating the power of new, sustainable affordable housing developments to revitalize and activate neighborhoods.""
""We know intrinsically that having good quality and stable housing is essential to well-being,"" said HPD Commissioner Mathew M. Wambua. ""Now, thanks to findings of research we have underway, we can say that we know for a fact that moving to affordable housing can reduce asthma symptoms, and anxiety and depression while increasing financial security. What is remarkable here is that such a short time ago, this site was a blighted, contaminated, rubbish-strewn mess. This transformation from vacant eyesore to spectacular vision became real thanks to Secretary Donovan, the New York AIA, Enterprise, NYSERDA and others who saw the possibilities here. We will keep working to develop and preserve affordable housing here in the South Bronx-the City of New York has a great deal at stake here and has invested and leveraged billions of dollars to make the community whole and worthy of being called home again.""
""Via Verde is the epitome of green development,"" said HDC President Marc Jahr. ""For us, ""green"" is much more than a convenient catchphrase or socially acceptable set of nebulous standards. It is the way we approach the job that we do, and the standard to which we hold our partners. In making green part of our ethos, we require energy efficiency, water conservation and healthy air quality indoors and outdoors. And just as important-we hold the bottom line steady-lower operating costs mean lower overhead which translates into more sustainable affordability. And wherever you go in this community, no matter where you look, you can see the results of our labors. Together with our partners in the public, private and not-for-profit sectors, we are making a difference; taking ambitious strides toward establishing a legacy of a more affordable, environmentally conscious and healthier New York City.""
""Via Verde represents the next wave in affordable housing: cutting-edge design, innovative public and private sector financing, smart use of land, all at an affordable price. Many of the technologies used to construct Via Verde hold promise for changing the way we build affordable housing, providing better, more efficient, and more beautiful apartment buildings. Via Verde has definitely changed the way Phipps Houses - and all of us - think of affordable housing,"" said Adam Weinstein, President and CEO, The Phipps Houses Group.
""Via Verde is an intensively green, energy-efficient building, but it's also a sustainable community that focuses on the quality of life and health of the families who will live here,"" said Jonathan F.P. Rose, President of Jonathan Rose Companies. ""To create vibrant, dense cities, we need models that integrate housing and health, food and family, security and sociability, reflection and restoration as integrated systems. Via Verde demonstrates that such integration is possible.""
""Under Governor Andrew Cuomo's leadership, the State's housing agencies have put a premium on green, sustainable affordable housing,"" said New York State Homes and Community Renewal Commissioner/CEO Darryl C. Towns. ""Via Verde was truly a collaborative effort with the City, State, Phipps Houses and Jonathan Rose Companies - creating an urban oasis of healthier housing in the South Bronx. The State's more than $13 million investment in this innovative project included grants from the Affordable Housing Corporation (AHC) to subsidize the co-ops, access to low-rate SONYMA mortgages for first-time homebuyers living here, and State Low Income Housing Tax Credits. This mixed-income project will help to strengthen and stabilize the community, neighborhood and the Bronx and creates a new paradigm - a green sanctuary that completely redefines an urban landscape.""
The approximately $99 million complex includes three distinct building types: a 20-story tower at the north end of the site, six-to-12 story mid-rise buildings in the middle, and three-to-four story townhouses to the south. The development boasts 151 units of low-income rental housing and 71 moderate- and middle-income co-op units for a total of 222 mixed-income affordable units. The rental units are located in the tower and midrise building, with the cooperative units situated in the townhouses and also in the midrise building.
The low-income rental units are fully leased. Of the 151 rental units, 17 units are reserved for household earning 30% of the Area Median Income (AMI) or what is equivalent to $23,040 for a family of four, 13 units are set at 40% AMI ($30,720 for a family of four), 120 units are set at 60% AMI ($46,080 for a family of four), with one of the units set aside for the superintendent. Fifty-six of the cooperative units have been sold to date. Of the 71 total cooperative units, five units are reserved for households earning 80% AMI ($61,450 for a family of four), 39 units are set at 150% AMI ($115,200 for a family of four), 26 units are set at 175% AMI ($134,400 for a family of four). All of the units in Via Verde were offered to the public via a lottery: for the 151 rental apartments there were 7,000 applications.
At the heart of Via Verde are a series of gardens that begin in the courtyard then spiral up through a series of green roofs and south facing solar panels. The rooftop gardens dissipate heat and absorb rainwater runoff, using a reclamation system that recycles water for irrigation, while providing opportunities for active gardening, fruit and vegetable cultivation, relaxation and social gathering. The facade features aluminum, cement, and wood panels with panoramic windows, sunshades, and courtyard balconies. A landscaped courtyard, the green roofs, a fitness center, and day-lit stairs promote healthy lifestyles and provide opportunities for physical fitness.
""The Via Verde housing development is the cutting edge for affordable housing-and it is fitting that it would be situated in the Bronx. Our community has embraced the 'green agenda' for change and empowerment and the results are being enjoyed every day - whether it's new parks and green spaces or community organizing or new jobs in the green sector. Now we see housing built for working people that is innovative and sustainable. I tip my cap to all those involved in this project from start to finish and look forward to talking with happy residents in the near future,"" said Congressman Jose E. Serrano.
""I am excited and glad to officially celebrate the completion of the Via Verde development on Brook Avenue. The Bronx is breaking the mold and setting the standard for a 21st century way of building affordable housing. The Via Verde project which was highlighted in the New York Times as a leading model of sustainable development, will help our Bronx residents live healthier through its state-of- the-art living space and roof top gardens,"" said Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr.
""Via Verde was born from a collaboration of public and private forces - including the Bloomberg Administration, HPD, American Institute of Architects New York Chapter and the development community - and now serves a national model for sustainable affordable housing,"" said Rick Bell, executive director of AIANY. ""Via Verde stunningly demonstrates that the creation of beautiful, healthy and affordable housing is possible if enough people say that it is a priority for our city, and for those empowered by voters, residents and designers to shape it. Design matters.""
The Via Verde development was the winning response to the New Housing New York Legacy competition, sponsored by HPD, the New York Chapter of the American Institute of Architects, the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), and the Enterprise Foundation. It was New York City's first juried design competition for affordable and sustainable housing. The New Housing New York Legacy Competition's aim was to promote affordable, sustainable, and mixed-income housing by using innovative design on a site that had proved difficult to develop. A joint venture among the HPD, HDC, Jonathan Rose Companies and Phipps Housing Services, and designed by Dattner Architects and Grimshaw Architects, is green affordable housing that prioritizes sustainable, healthy urban living. It is designed to achieve LEED Gold certification from the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC), including an innovation credit for integrating Active Living Guidelines, and to meet NYSERDA standards through the incorporation of a range of innovative environmentally responsible design features.
In keeping with Via Verde's mission as a model for healthy, sustainable living, Montefiore Medical Center will open a comprehensive family practice at Via Verde in the fall. Staffed with four full-time family medicine physicians, nurses, support staff and a social worker, the 5,000-sq. ft. practice is projected to deliver over 15,000 visits each year to approximately 6,000 patients. There is an additional 2,000-square-feet of retail space as well.
Via Verde's innovation in green design started at construction by using eco-friendly building practices. The project was constructed using 20% recycled materials with more than 20% of total building materials having been manufactured locally, minimizing transportation energy and supporting the local economy. In addition, more than 80% of the construction and demolition waste was recycled.
Energy saving and sustainable features designed into Via Verde include motion sensors in stairways and corridors to conserve electricity and building-integrated photovoltaic panels to produce electricity from solar energy. Individual apartments feature EnergyStar appliances, energy-efficient lighting, panoramic, high-efficiency windows, natural cross ventilation in all duplex apartments, Low VOC materials improve air quality, super-sealed insulation, and water-conserving fixtures.
""Via Verde realizes a vision for innovative, sustainable affordable housing in the South Bronx. Dattner Architects is honored to be part of the team with Phipps Houses, Jonathan Rose Companies, our colleagues at Grimshaw and the other participants, to create this community inspired by the integration of nature and city,"" said William Stein FAIA, Principal, Dattner Architects.
""Via Verde's mandate for healthy living in affordable housing inspires not only a place to live, but a way to think. Grimshaw is grateful for this inspiration, as well as the opportunity to collaborate on such a notable project with Phipps Houses, Jonathan Rose Companies, Dattner Architects, and the entire project team. We sincerely hope the efforts put forward will enrich the lives of its residents, the community, and the future of affordable housing,"" said Virginia Little LEED AP, Architect, Grimshaw.
The vacant 1.5-acre site where Via Verde now stands was conveyed by HPD to the development team at a nominal cost to help subsidize the affordability the project. There were several unique challenges to developing the site including its unique triangular in shape and the fact that most of it was an abandoned railroad yard that lay below street-level. The corner of the development site at East 156 Street and Brook Avenue was previously used as a gas station, which, along with its former use as a rail yard, contributed to contamination severe enough to require extensive remediation. Via Verde is also participating in NYS Department of Environmental Conservation Brownfield Cleanup Program (BCP) and the developer provided $2.68 million in upfront BCP equity.
""This project epitomizes New York State's Brownfield Cleanup Program. This contaminated former industrial site, which was vacant for many years, was successfully cleaned up and put back into productive use. We congratulate Phipps Houses and Jonathan Rose Companies on the grand opening of Via Verde,"" said NYSDEC Regional Director Venetia Lannon.
During construction HPD and HDC lent the project a combined $80 million, a portion of which was paid down at completion via tax credit equity generated from the rental units and sales proceeds from the co-op units.
Permanent financing sources for the Via Verde affordable rental portion included an HDC first mortgage of $4.37 million, as well as $12.84 million in subsidy under its New Housing Opportunity Program (NewHOP). HPD provided $2.52 million in federal HOME funds and $9.77 million in City Capital funds. The Federal Home Loan Bank provided $1.9 million in AHP funds, and NYSERDA provided $380,000 in funding. HCR provided $7 million in Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) equity. HPD provided $25 million in LIHTC equity. Phipps provided $1 million in Brownfield Cleanup Program equity for site remediation. An additional $2 million of developer equity was also contributed.
Permanent financing sources for the Via Verde cooperative portion included an HDC first mortgage of $5.83 million, and HPD provided $9.1 million in City Capital funds along with $712,630 in federal HOME funds. HCR provided $2.12 million in grants, through the Affordable Housing Corporation (AHC), to subsidize the purchase of the 70 co-ops, and up to $4.7 million in SONYMA first-time homebuyer, low-cost fixed-rate mortgage financing. The Bronx Borough President's office provided $1 million in Reso A funds and Councilmember Arroyo provided $500,000 in Reso A funds. NYSERDA contributed an additional $187,331. Sales proceeds of $7.73 million and additional developer equity of $3.12 million will come in at permanent conversion. The developers provided $1.7 million of Brownfield Cleanup Program equity for site remediation.
JPMorgan Chase was the only private lender and investor in this project, providing a total of $76.5 million in construction loans and equity through the purchase of Federal Low Income Housing Tax Credits and New York State credits. As the investor in the tax credits, Chase is committed to this project for the next 15 years.
For the Via Verde affordable rental portion, HDC provided $33.69 million in taxable bond proceeds at construction and a first mortgage of $4.37 million, as well as $12.84 million in subsidy under the New Housing Opportunity Program (NewHOP). HPD provided $2.52 million in federal HOME funds and $9.77 million in City Capital funds. The Federal Home Loan Bank provided $1.9 million in AHP funds; NYSERDA provided $380,000 in funding; NYS Homes and Community Renewal (HCR) and HPD provided $32 million in LIHC/SLIHC/LIHTC equity funds.
For the Via Verde cooperative portion, HDC provided $7.44 million in taxable bonds proceeds, as well as a $5.83 million first mortgage and $4.62 million in subsidy. HPD provided $712,630 in federal HOME funds and $9.1 million in City Capital funds. The Bronx Borough President's office provided $1 million in Reso A funds and Councilmember Arroyo provided $500,000 in RESO A funds. The Calvert Foundation provided a $2.5 million loan to the project. The Affordable Housing Corporation (AHC) provided $2.12 million, and $187,331 was contributed from NYSERDA. Sales proceeds of $7.73 million and additional developer equity of $3.12 million will come in at permanent conversion.
""As New York City's largest bank, we want to help build strong communities by investing in projects that provide affordable, high-quality housing,"" said Frank Bisignano, JPMorgan Chase Chief Administrative Officer and CEO of Mortgage Banking. ""Via Verde will do that for the South Bronx, while improving the health of residents.""
""Congratulations to all involved in the Via Verde project and its LEED Gold certification,"" said Francis J. Murray Jr., President and CEO of the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority. ""Via Verde represents the successful culmination of a highly creative approach to green, healthy urban living. NYSERDA is proud of the project's partnership with the Multifamily Performance Program and its emphasis on the role of efficiency in controlling energy usage and costs while ensuring comfort for residents.""
Situated just outside of the Melrose Commons Urban Renewal Area, Via Verde represents the City's latest achievement in its ongoing efforts to rebuild the South Bronx following the massive population loss, blight and abandonment of the 1970s and 1980s. The City adopted the Melrose Commons Urban Renewal Plan (URP) in the early 1990s with 66 sites comprised of approximately 46 contiguous acres located in the center of the South Bronx and shared by Community Districts 1 and 3, with the goal of creating a variety of housing types for an economically diverse population. Since construction began, 2,818 new residential units have been completed, including 2,412 units in 17 multifamily buildings and 406 units in seven small home developments. Currently an additional 217 units are under construction in one multi-family project. When all sites are completed it is expected that approximately 3,700 new residential units and approximately 300,000-square-feet of commercial space will have been created. This effort and partnership between the City and the community is largely credited with bringing the neighborhood back to life.
Understanding the health impacts of Via Verde's unique and innovative design will help to show the value of affordable housing investments and provide new knowledge of how housing can be leveraged to increase physical activity, which could lead to long-term reduction in the rate of diabetes and heart disease. HPD and Columbia University, along with other academic and municipal partners, are currently conducting a multi-million study funded by the National Institutes of Health and the MacArthur Foundation that will quantify the benefits of newly constructed housing financed under the New Housing Marketplace Plan, including Via Verde. This critical research is already demonstrating that moving to affordable housing can reduce asthma symptoms, reduce anxiety and depression, increase financial security, and improve housing quality and affordability. The study will evaluate whether buildings such as Via Verde produce measurable gains for adults and children, above and beyond those of other types of affordable housing."

During a news conference today, the agencies were joined by the American Lung Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics as they unveiled the toolkits HUD's Office of Healthy Homes and Lead Hazard Control (OHHLHC) developed with the partnering agencies. These kits provide housing owners/managers and residents with user-friendly information related to the adoption of smoke-free housing policies.
""A healthy home is a smoke-free home,"" said Jon Gant, Director of HUD's Office of Healthy Homes and Lead Hazard Control. ""If we're serious about promoting healthy living conditions in federally assisted housing, then we have to get serious about promoting smoke-free housing. HUD is pleased to join hands with our partners in this important effort to create a healthy home environment for families and their children.""
HUD Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing Sandra Henriquez added: ""HUD is working hard to promote health and prevent disease by encouraging public housing agencies, multi-family owners and agents, as well as residents, to work with their local public health and medical communities to adopt smoke-free housing policies. We want to provide them with resources as we work together to create healthy homes.""
The new Smoke-Free Housing Toolkits can be used by residents, multifamily housing managers/owners, including public housing authorities, to promote healthier housing. The owner's toolkit includes HUD's guidance to public housing authorities and multifamily housing owners/managers, such as: a guide to implementing no-smoking policies, a sample resident survey, frequently asked questions, and other useful resources. The residents' kit includes a going smoke-free guide, a home smoke-free pledge kit, and additional education materials about second-hand smoke.
Additionally, the new toolkits advise private landlords and public housing authorities to:
Advertise units as non-smoking to attract tenants who either don't smoke or only smoke outside; Talk to prospective tenants about their smoke-free policy when showing the property; Include no-smoking policies in lease agreements and read through the rule with tenants as they sign their lease; Display no-smoking signage in buildings and on the property; Consider partnering with organizations to offer smoking cessation support to residents; Inform tenants that if they smoke in their units, they will be financially responsible for the costs of restoring the unit; Use the same warning/enforcement methods for smoke-free rule violations used for any other lease infractions; and Visit and inspect properties regularly.

06/29/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-109.cfm,Senior Administration Officials Lead White House Forum on Sustainable Communities,"WASHINGTON - The Obama Administration today convened a meeting with more than 50 local government and business leaders to discuss the role of sustainability in economic development and job creation. The gathering coincided with the third anniversary of the creation of the Partnership for Sustainable Communities, a landmark collaboration between the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
Administration participants included HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan, DOT Deputy Secretary John Porcari, EPA Regional Director Gwendolyn Keyes Fleming, White House Director of the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs David Agnew and White House Director of the Office of Public Engagement Jon Carson.
""At a moment when federal funds are precious, we need to ensure every taxpayer dollar is working to bring private investment off the sidelines and into our communities and economy,"" said HUD Secretary Donovan. ""By bringing stakeholders from all sectors to the table and planning together with local business partners we are eliminating barriers to private sector investment - ensuring local planning efforts are aligned not only across government but with the businesses and investors communities need to spur long-term economic growth.""
Comprised of HUD, DOT, and EPA, the Partnership is a landmark collaboration designed to increase cooperation between the departments and strategically target transportation, land use, housing, environmental and other community development resources. Since 2009, the Partnership has provided over $3.7 billion in assistance to more than 700 communities in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.
The purpose of bringing local government and business leaders together at the White House forum was to discuss how sustainability strategies make regional economies more competitive in a global market. The forum also focused on how coordinated investments in housing, transportation, the environment and regional economies can attract businesses to their regions and create jobs.
""The Obama Administration is committed to giving the American taxpayer a bigger bang for its buck, so we are working with our partners at HUD and EPA to implement strategies that will help Americans lower household transportation costs, improve air quality by lowering emissions and reduce our dependence on oil,"" said U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood.
""For three years, the Partnership for Sustainable Communities has supported communities across the country as they work toward their economic and environmental goals,"" said EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson. ""By coordinating resources across the Federal government, we're taking the necessary steps to ensure that each dollar we spend is more effective in helping communities protect human health and the environment, enhance their residents' day-to-day lives, and lay the groundwork for long-term economic growth.""
Based on the high demand for Partnership assistance from municipalities and regional authorities, HUD, DOT, and EPA announced at the White House Forum that a select number of their competitive assistance programs would be more formally aligned. For the first time, the three agencies will take the other agencies' investments into account in making grant allocation decisions and utilize common language in notice of funding proposals. This type of reciprocal arrangement will bring a new level of coordination to federal investments and ensure that are designed to achieve maximum efficiency and effectiveness.

07/06/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-111.cfm,Obama Administration Releases June Housing Scorecard,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of the Treasury today released the June edition of the Obama Administration's Housing Scorecard - a comprehensive report on the nation's housing market. Data in the June Housing Scorecard show some promising signs of stability, though the overall outlook remains mixed. Home equity rose $457.1 billion in the first quarter of 2012, a 7.4 percent increase from the previous quarter and its highest level since the second quarter of 2010. Sales of previously owned homes posted sharp gains in May of 9.6 percent compared with a year ago and new home sales in May recorded their highest level in more than 2 years. However, foreclosure starts and completions turned up in May, underscoring continued fragility in the housing market. The full report is available online at www.hud.gov/scorecard.
HUD Acting Assistant Secretary Erika Poethig said, ""We're making important progress in providing relief to homeowners under the Obama Administration's programs. With almost half a million families taking advantage of our enhanced Home Affordable Refinance Program - standing to save on average $2,500 per year - and more than 51,000 applications for the FHA Streamline Refinance Program in the first ten days following the recent premium changes, it's clear that the Administration's efforts continue to provide significant positive benefits."" Poethig continued, ""But with so many homeowners still underwater on their mortgages and struggling to move into more sustainable loans, we have much more work ahead. That is why we are asking the Congress to approve the President's refinancing proposal so that more homeowners can receive assistance.""
""Millions of homeowners across the country have received assistance to avoid foreclosure as a result of the programs the Administration has put into place,"" said Assistant Secretary for Financial Stability Tim Massad. ""Recognizing that there is not one solution for every struggling family, we have continued to strengthen and expand our efforts to offer some of the most affordable and sustainable assistance available in an unprecedented housing crisis.""
The June Housing Scorecard features key data on the health of the housing market and the impact of the Administration's foreclosure prevention programs, including:
The Administration's recovery efforts continue to help millions of families deal with the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. More than 5.3 million modification arrangements were started between April 2009 and the end of May 2012 - including nearly 1.2 million homeowner assistance actions through the Making Home Affordable Program and more than 1.3 million FHA loss mitigation and early delinquency interventions. The Administration's programs continue to encourage improved standards and processes in the industry, with HOPE Now lenders offering families and individuals more than 2.9 million proprietary mortgage modifications through April. Homeowners entering HAMP demonstrate a high likelihood of long-term success in the program. As of May, more than one million homeowners have received a permanent HAMP modification, saving approximately $536 on their mortgage payments each month, and an estimated $13.3 billion to date. Eighty-six percent of homeowners entering the program in the last 23 months have received a permanent modification, with an average trial period of 3.5 months. More than 83,000 homeowners have had their principal reduced as part of their HAMP permanent modification, and nearly 84,000 second lien modifications have been completed through the Second Lien Modification Program (2MP).

According to HUD's charge, Greenbrier Village Condominium III Association allegedly maintained a policy prohibiting families with children under 18 from living in the building.
The Fair Housing Act, a federal law that protects civil rights in housing, prohibits housing providers, including condominium associations, from denying housing to families with children under the age of 18, unless they meet the federal standards to be housing for older persons.
""Condo associations that don't meet federal requirements as housing for older persons don't have the right to turn away families with children,"" said John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, the Office charged with enforcing the Fair Housing Act. ""HUD will continue to take action against homeowners associations that violate the Fair Housing Act by imposing restrictive residency policies.""
HUD's charge alleges that the condominium association's residency policy, which stated that ""no apartment may be sold, leased or rented to any person who has a child under the age of 18,"" prevented the owner of a condominium at Greenbrier Village from leasing the unit to several families with children, including a couple on whose behalf the charge was issued.
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages to those persons injured by the discrimination. In addition, the judge may impose a penalty of up to $16,000 to vindicate the public interest. The judge may also order injunctive and other equitable relief to deter further discrimination, as well as payment of attorney fees. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages to aggrieved persons.
FHEO and its partners in the Fair Housing Assistance Program investigate more than 10,000 housing discrimination complaints annually. People who believe they are the victims of housing discrimination should contact HUD at 1-800-669-9777 (voice), (800) 927-9275 (TTY)."

07/13/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-114.cfm,"HUD and Owner, Manager of Alabama Apartment Complex Settle Allegations of Discrimination Against Prospective Hispanic Tenants","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has reached an agreement with Chilton Associates, Ltd., owner of Peachtree Apartments in Clanton, Alabama, and its manager Sunbelt Management Company, settling allegations that they maintained a policy of discriminating against prospective tenants based on national origin. Specifically, HUD alleged that Peachtree Apartments required that prospective Hispanic tenants provide documentation of their immigration status, while not asking the same of non-Hispanic individuals.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to impose different rental terms and conditions based on national origin, race, color, religion, sex, familial status, or disability.
""Where you come from does not dictate where you can live,"" said John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Every person has the right to housing free from discrimination based on ethnicity. We are pleased that this company has taken steps to comply with the Fair Housing Act.""
The settlement stems from a complaint initiated by HUD after the Central Alabama Fair Housing Center (CAFHC) informed HUD that fair housing tests it had conducted suggested discrimination at the property. In one test, the property manager of Peachtree Apartments allegedly asked a CAFHC tester who was posing as a prospective tenant whether she was Hispanic. When the tester replied that she was Hispanic, the manager allegedly required that the tester produce a green card or ""work visa."" The manager also allegedly required the same identification from the prospective tenant's mother and two sons.
Under the settlement agreement, Chilton Associates will adopt non-discriminatory admission policies, develop a plan to market housing opportunities to populations with limited English proficiency in its service areas and provide translation services, and administer fair housing training to its employees and contractors. These provisions will apply to 9,406 housing units at 264 properties in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Tennessee.
Chilton Associates will also donate $5,000 to CAFHC to support fair housing enforcement and education, donate $5,000 to a local Alabama non-profit organization that serves the Latino community, and conduct periodic testing to ensure that it is providing its services to every applicant equally, regardless of national origin.
The settlement agreement is not an admission by Chilton Associates of any violation of the Fair Housing Act. Chilton Associates voluntarily entered into the settlement agreement to demonstrate its commitment to conduct its housing programs and activities in compliance with the requirements of the Fair Housing Act.
HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, with its partners in the Fair Housing Assistance Program, investigates approximately 10,000 housing discrimination complaints annually.

07/17/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-115.cfm,HUD Announces Nearly $13 Million to Produce Affordable Housing for Low Income Native Hawaiians,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Shaun Donovan today announced $12.7 million in funding to produce affordable housing for low-income native Hawaiian families. Since the program began in 2002, HUD's Native Hawaiian Housing Block Grant (NHHBG) and the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands have built, acquired, and rehabilitated more than 460 housing units.
In addition, NHHBG-funded programs offered a wide variety of housing counseling services as well as do-it-yourself home repair training to more than 800 low-income Native Hawaiian families.
""I'm extremely proud of our close association with the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands over these past ten years,"" said Donovan. ""As our housing markets continue to recover, this grant will make a difference in the lives of hundreds of families struggling to find decent and affordable housing to live. HUD continues its support for reauthorization of the NHHBG program to ensure that affordable housing opportunities will continue to be provided to Native Hawaiian families into the future.""
Senator Inouye said ""The Native Hawaiian people and their culture are the foundation for the way of life we enjoy in Hawaii. They have given the great gift of Aloha to all who have come to Hawaii's shores, their homeland, over the centuries. Unfortunately, like so many in this country, there are those in the Native Hawaiian community who have difficulty accessing affordable housing and taking the steps necessary to realize home ownership. I would like to thank Secretary Donovan and the administration for helping the Department of Hawaiian Homelands fulfill their critical mission of providing shelter for Native Hawaiian families.""
According to its annual housing plan, the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands (DHHL) will use the funds to:
Increase the affordable housing inventory on Hawaiian home lands through infrastructure development (mass grading, drainage, streets, utilities, etc.) and house construction including sweat equity projects. Reduce the purchase price of housing by providing direct assistance to eligible families through down payment assistance, principal reduction subsidies, low/no interest rate loans, and matching funds for Individual Development Accounts. Reduce the number of homes occupied by eligible families that are in need of repair or replacement to relieve substandard living conditions, overcrowding, and to improve energy efficiency through low/no interest loans and grants for home rehabilitation. Increase alternative energy resources and/or programs that will benefit eligible families as a means to reduce housing costs through loans and/or grants to install energy efficient devices including solar water heating, photovoltaic panels, etc. Increase community access to resources that will address public safety needs, organizational needs, and eligible model activities; including but not limited to safety enhancements, organizational support, community policing, and model activities that incorporate educational, cultural, and recreational activities for affordable housing residents. Increase access to educational or training programs that assist eligible native Hawaiian families with financial literacy education and counseling, homebuyer education, home maintenance, and foreclosure prevention. Ensure adequate administrative capacity for DHHL to implement and monitor the NHHBG program.

07/18/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-116.cfm,"HUD Accepting Applications for Entities to Purchase Troubled Mortgages, Offer Chance to Avoid Costly Foreclosures and Stabilize Neighborhoods","WASHINGTON - Qualified entities interested in purchasing pools of severely distressed loans formerly insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) can now submit applications for the Distressed Asset Stabilization Program, an expansion of an FHA disposition program that sells pools of defaulted mortgages headed for foreclosure and provides the opportunity for the purchaser and borrower to avoid a costly foreclosure. According to loan pool information released today, approximately 3,500 loans will be sold in four metropolitan areas that are among those hardest hit by the foreclosure crisis - Chicago, IL; Newark, NJ; Phoenix, AZ; and Tampa, FL - aligning with other neighborhood stabilization efforts to help those communities recover as quickly as possible. The program is part of the Obama Administration's broader strategy to encourage public/private partnerships to stabilize neighborhoods and home values in critical markets. Details on the Distressed Asset Stabilization Program can be found at www.hud.gov/fhaloansales.
""The housing market has momentum not seen since before the crisis,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""But some metro areas are still under pressure and some FHA borrowers remain seriously behind on their loans and stand to lose their homes in a matter of months. As one step towards avoiding unnecessary foreclosures and further stabilizing communities, we are increasing the number of loans beyond our original goals of 5,000 per quarter to approximately 9,000 this quarter. Providing the opportunity for borrowers to potentially stay in their home under a new sustainable mortgage or other meaningful help not only benefits that homeowner but reduces the costs to FHA and ultimately benefits the entire community.""
Under the program, loans are sold competitively at a market-determined price generally below the outstanding principal balance. FHA then processes an insurance claim, removes the FHA insurance and transfers the loan to the investor. Once the note is purchased, foreclosure is delayed for a minimum of six additional months, giving the new servicer time to work through alternatives with the borrower, possibly finding an affordable solution to allow the borrower to remain in their home. Because the loans are generally sold for less than what the borrower currently owes, the purchaser has the ability to reduce or modify the loan terms while still making a return on the initial investment. If no viable alternatives exist, the purchaser may be able to help the borrower sell the property through a short sale and avoid the costs of foreclosure.
""This program creates the opportunity for everyone - the homeowner, the new mortgage holder, FHA, and the community - to walk away a winner,"" said Acting FHA Commissioner Carol Galante. ""FHA not only avoids the costs associated with a long foreclosure process, but also the high costs of maintaining and selling vacant properties in already distressed markets.""
FHA began selling distressed single family loans through what is now the Distressed Asset Stabilization Program in 2010 and has successfully sold more than 2,100 single family loans to date. An FHA-approved mortgagee can file a claim for FHA insurance benefits and assign the loan to FHA if the borrower is at least six months delinquent on their mortgage; the servicer has exhausted all steps in the FHA loss mitigation process; the servicer has initiated foreclosure proceedings; and the borrower is not in bankruptcy. These assigned loans are then pooled by FHA for resale through the Distressed Asset Stabilization Program.
Neighborhood Stabilization Loan Sales
In addition to the standard note sales, the enhanced program features new neighborhood stabilization requirements to encourage investment in communities hit hardest by the foreclosure crisis. Approximately 40 percent of the 9,000 loans in the sale scheduled for September 2012 will be located in Chicago, IL; Newark, NJ; Phoenix, AZ; and Tampa, FL - four metropolitan areas where high numbers of seriously delinquent loans could expand an already large inventory of REO properties over the coming months. Designed to help stem the flow of distressed properties hitting these markets, these neighborhood stabilization requirements provide that no more than 50 percent of the loans within a purchased neighborhood stabilizationpool may be sold as real-estate owned (REO) properties.
""These markets were chosen because of the high concentration of FHA loans in the pipeline for foreclosure and because each allows us to test this strategy under a variety of market conditions,"" added Galante. ""Further, in some of these communities, state and local leaders are already acquiring these loans and using tools like the Neighborhood Stabilization Program and the Hardest Hit Fund to offer workable solutions for homeowners and communities. And in each city, nonprofit and for-profit investors have shown great interest in using this program to help borrowers in their community find affordable solutions as quickly as possible. FHA is working with local leaders to create additional smaller pools to fit their targeted neighborhood strategies.""
All parties seeking to bid on the sale pools must first be qualified by HUD. Parties seeking to bid in the neighborhood stabilization pools are required to meet several additional criteria to ensure they will comply with the program's goal that fewer homes end up as vacant REO properties in metro areas already struggling with high numbers of foreclosures. Eligible investors must have experience in asset management and property management, as well as a proven track record in helping borrowers seriously delinquent on their loans to re-perform or to achieve an affordable alternative to foreclosure. An emphasis will be placed on experience within the metro area in which the bidder is interested.

07/26/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-120.cfm,"HUD Issues Final Rule Aimed at Preserving Public, Other HUD-Assisted Housing","WASHINGTON - With the publication of the Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) final rules in today's Federal Register, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) officially implemented the Obama Administration's groundbreaking strategy to preserve tens of thousands of units of public and assisted housing.
RAD allows public housing agencies and owners of certain at-risk, federally-assisted properties to convert their current assistance to long-term contracts. Such contracts will better allow owners to leverage millions of dollars in debt and equity to address immediate capital needs and preserve these affordable housing units. Today's publication updates initial rules published for public comment in March.
""After extensive consultation over the past few years with key stakeholders, including public housing agencies, multifamily property owners, residents and the lending community, this innovative approach greatly enhances our ability to confront the decline of our public housing and older assisted housing stock,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""RAD allows HUD to test the conversion of assistance as a means of preserving this scarce inventory of affordable housing and keep it on firm financial footing well into the future.""
Last year, HUD released Capital Needs in the Public Housing Program, a Congressionally-funded study of capital needs in public housing. The study found that the nation's 1.2 million public housing units need nearly $26 billion to keep these homes in safe and decent condition for families, a figure well in excess of the roughly $2 billion annually that the Congress appropriates for capital repairs. Beyond the public housing stock, the Moderate Rehabilitation (Mod Rehab), Rent Supplement (Rent Supp), and Rental Assistance Payment (RAP) programs either offer no option to renew and risk being lost from the affordable housing stock or cannot renew on terms that attract sufficient capital to preserve long-term affordability.
RAD is part of the Obama Administration's comprehensive strategy to preserve public and HUD-assisted housing. In November 2011, Congress authorized HUD to implement RAD as a budget-neutral demonstration program with two components, allowing for the conversion of assistance for public housing, Mod Rehab, Rent Supp, and RAP properties to long-term contracts with stable funding.
HUD estimates that the authority under RAD will enable owners to leverage financing to help reduce the severe backlog of capital repair needs. In the process, RAD will help create and support local construction jobs in communities across the country.
The initial RAD program rules issued in March gave the general public an opportunity to comment on the overall framework for RAD, including eligibility criteria, ranking factors, application instructions, review and approval processes, and anticipated timelines. The final program rules reflect HUD's consideration of the more than 100 different individuals and organizations that submitted comments. Along with the publication of the final rules, HUD has published a document detailing its response to public comments.
The initial application window for the competitive component of RAD (for public housing and owners of Mod Rehab projects) is scheduled to be open from September 24, 2012 to October 24, 2012. The non-competitive component of RAD (for owners of Mod Rehab, Rent Supp and RAP projects) is effective immediately."

08/02/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-125.cfm,HUD Secretary Donovan and Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller Unveil First Public Service Announcement for $25 Billion Mortgage Servicing Settlement,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Shaun Donovan and Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller announced today the launch of the National Mortgage Servicing Settlement's first public service announcement (PSA) television ad titled ""Homeowner Help (www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wiBbSFli0I&feature=youtu.be)."" The PSA, which can be viewed at www.hud.gov and www.nationalmortgagesettlement.com, is designed to educate homeowners about the resources available to them through the mortgage servicing settlement.
The ""Homeowner Help (www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wiBbSFli0I&feature=youtu.be)"" PSA, amplified through three key components - 30 second television and radio spots, customized for both national and local media markets, a HUD Homeowner Help website and a new Mortgage Assistance Guide - is aimed at educating homeowners about the various options and opportunities they can seek for assistance to find out if they are eligible to benefit from the settlement.
""The National Mortgage Servicing Settlement represents the single largest-scale principal reduction effort we've seen since this housing crisis began and the PSAs and online tools announced today will create an extended opportunity for homeowners, across the country, to gain access to information, options and opportunities that could help to keep them in their homes,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""Already the servicing settlement is helping homeowners and making a difference, and our goal is to ensure every eligible family is aware of the help it provides.""
In addition to being televised, ""Homeowner Help (www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wiBbSFli0I&feature=youtu.be)"" will also be broadcast in both English and Spanish language radio formats for national and localized markets.

""We want homeowners to know the possibilities that they have with this settlement. PSAs are already running in Iowa and we're hopeful that information shared helps people in a substantial way.""
In April, a Federal District Court approved the landmark $25 billion agreement between the Justice Department, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, 49 state attorneys general and the nation's five largest mortgage servicers - Ally/GMAC, Bank of America, Citi, JP Morgan Chase, and Wells Fargo - to address mortgage loan servicing and foreclosure abuses. The settlement will provide up to $25 billion in relief to borrowers and direct payments to the states and federal government and it is the largest multi-state settlement since the Tobacco Settlement in 1998.

08/03/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-129.cfm,Obama Administration Releases July Housing Scorecard,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of the Treasury today released the July edition of the Obama Administration's Housing Scorecard - a comprehensive report on the nation's housing market. Data in the Housing Scorecard show continued signs of recovery as foreclosure starts and completions declined in June, though officials expect activity to increase in the coming months as firms lift delays in foreclosure processing. In addition, the inventory of houses for sale remained low; at current pace, it would take 6.6 months to sell the supply of existing homes on the market and 4.9 months to clear the new homes on the market. Experts consider a six month supply of homes to be a balanced market. Distressed sales remain a key factor, however, as the impact of serious delinquencies and underwater mortgages continue to temper market gains. The full report is available online at www.hud.gov/scorecard.
HUD Acting Assistant Secretary Erika Poethig said, ""This month's indicators show momentum not seen since before the housing crisis as refinances through our enhanced Home Affordable Refinance Program continue to surge -- HARP loans represented 20 percent of total refinance volume in May, the largest increase since the program was launched in 2009. But with so many households still struggling to make ends meet, it's clear that we have more work ahead."" Poethig continued, ""That is why we are asking the Congress to approve the President's refinancing proposal so that more homeowners can receive assistance.""
""HAMP continues to offer the deepest and most sustainable assistance available to prevent foreclosure. Homeowners in the program have a high likelihood of successfully overcoming their financial hardship and maintaining their mortgage payments for the long term,"" said Treasury Assistant Secretary for Financial Stability Tim Massad. ""We remain committed to utilizing the tools we have available to help our country heal faster from an unprecedented crisis.""
July Housing Scorecard features key data on the health of the housing market and the impact of the Administration's foreclosure prevention programs, including:
The Administration's foreclosure programs are providing relief for millions of homeowners as the housing market continues to recover from an unprecedented crisis. More than 1.2 million homeowner assistance actions have taken place through the Administration's Making Home Affordable Program, while the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) has offered more than 1.4 million loss mitigation and early delinquency interventions. The Administration's programs continue to encourage improved standards and processes in the industry, with HOPE Now lenders offering families and individuals more than 2.9 million proprietary mortgage modifications through May. Homeowners in HAMP continue to demonstrate long-term success in the program. As of June, more than one million homeowners have received a permanent HAMP modification, saving approximately $537 on their mortgage payments each month, and an estimated $13.9 billion to date. In June, 75 percent of homeowners with non-GSE mortgages benefitted from principal reduction with their HAMP modification. Eighty-six percent of homeowners starting the program in the last two years have received a permanent modification. HAMP modifications continue to exhibit lower delinquency and re-default rates than private industry modifications, with 94 percent of homeowners still current on their modified payments after six months.

Also featured this month is the Administration's Housing Scorecard Regional Spotlight on market strength in Miami, Florida and surrounding communities. The Miami metro area was one of the hardest hit areas in the nation following the housing market downturn and an area where the Administration's broad approach to stabilizing the housing market has been very active.
""The fragile signs of stability that the national data show for the broader housing market are even more delicate in the Miami market,"" said Poethig. ""The Administration is working hard to help all homeowners who have been hit hard during the crisis and, as this Regional Spotlight shows, our efforts have helped more than 147,000 Miami households to avoid foreclosure. A modest local economic recovery is underway, but we have much more to do to reach the many households who still face trouble and to help the Miami market recover.""
The bi-monthly Housing Scorecard Regional Spotlight features data on the health of the Miami housing market and impact of efforts to help homeowners at the local level including:
Economic conditions in Miami are improving, but the local housing market remains fragile - with high concentrations of distressed mortgages, large numbers of vacancies, and 45 percent of home mortgages underwater. Miami currently ranks first in the nation for mortgages 90 or more days delinquent or in the foreclosure process. In addition, the state has the third longest foreclosure processing time, as lender processing delays and a backlog in the courts extend the average stay in the foreclosure pipeline. However, a modest recovery is underway as unemployment rates have fallen from a high of 11.4 in September 2010 to 8.6 percent in May 2012, and home prices have been rising since early 2011. More than 147,500 Miami households have received mortgage modifications, many directly through Administration programs. Since April 1, 2009 more than 147,500 mortgage assistance interventions have been offered to homeowners in the Miami metropolitan area. Nearly 66,900 interventions were offered through HAMP and the FHA loss mitigation and early delinquency intervention programs. An estimated additional 80,600 proprietary modifications have been offered through HOPE Now Alliance servicers. While some homeowners may have received help from more than one program, the number of times assistance has been offered in the Miami MSA is nearly 50 percent higher than the number of foreclosures completed during this period (100,000). In addition, more than 287,000 Miami homeowners stand to benefit from the $8.5 billion in relief provided to the state under the landmark Mortgage Servicing Settlement announced in February 2012. Nationwide, the settlement will provide more than $37.8 billion in benefits that include payments to the participating states, payments to borrowers, refinance funding, fee reductions and homeowner benefits. Nearly 1.7 million Americans will benefit from the mortgage settlement. The Administration's Hardest Hit Fund and Neighborhood Stabilization Programs have fueled local foreclosure prevention efforts and market stability. At approximately $1.06 billion, Florida has received substantial support through the Hardest Hit Fund to implement local solutions to mitigate borrower mortgage defaults, particularly for homeowners struggling with unemployment. Moreover, approximately $427 million has been awarded to 26 jurisdictions through the Neighborhood Stabilization Program to help purchase or redevelop residential properties and address the effects of abandoned and foreclosed housing. Both programs have helped provide increased stability to the Miami housing market.

08/08/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-124.cfm,HUD Charges Owners and Managers of Alabama Mobile Home Park with Discriminating Against African American Family,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is charging the owners and managers of Heritage Point Mobile Home Park in Montgomery, Alabama, with violating the Fair Housing Act for refusing to rent a lot in the park to an African American family and employing a policy of excluding African Americans. HUD charged Lawrence at Lakewood, LLC, and Lawrence Properties, Inc., which own and manage Heritage Point and other mobile home parks in Alabama and Georgia; Michael Lawrence, CEO of both companies; and William Bounds, district supervisor for four mobile home parks, including Heritage Point.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to discriminate in housing transactions based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, disability, or familial status.
""Refusing to rent a lot effectively denies a mobile home dweller a place to live,"" said John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""The Fair Housing Act protects families from discrimination based on race or national origin.""
HUD alleges that discrimination based on race, color and national origin occurred when the CEO told company employees that he did not want any more African Americans moving into his mobile home parks and employees refused to process an African American family's application to rent a lot for the mobile home they had recently purchased. According to the charge, Mr. Bounds told the family that their application was denied, falsely citing results from a credit check that was not made. The family was required to move their mobile home out of the park after their rental application was denied. The owners and managers also allegedly preferred to rent to Hispanic applicants and allowed certain Hispanic applicants to move into the park without submitting rental applications or undergoing background checks.
A United States Administrative Law Judge will hear HUD's charge unless any party elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages to the family. In addition, the judge may impose fines to vindicate the public interest, order injunctive and other equitable relief to deter further discrimination, and require payment of attorney fees. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages to the aggrieved persons.
HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity and its partners in the Fair Housing Assistance Program investigate approximately 10,000 housing discrimination complaints annually.
People who believe they have experienced or witnessed unlawful housing discrimination should contact HUD at 1-800-669-9777 (voice). More information about fair housing rights is available at HUD's website, www.hud.gov/fairhousing."
08/09/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-123.cfm,HUD and Huntsville Utilities Reach Agreement Settling an Allegation of Discrimination Against Prospective Hispanic Residential Customers,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has reached an agreement with Huntsville Utilities in Huntsville, Alabama, settling an allegation that the utility company discriminated against prospective customers based on national origin by requiring that Hispanic applicants apply for residential utility service in person, while offering non-Hispanic applicants the option of applying in person or online. In addition, the company's application required individuals requesting residential service to provide their Social Security number. Huntsville Utilities provides water, natural gas and electric services to approximately 170,000 households in Huntsville, Madison County and northern Marshall County, Alabama.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to impose different terms or conditions in the provision of services in connection with a dwelling, based on national origin, race, color, religion, sex, familial status, or disability.
""Equal access to utility services is fundamental to fair housing,"" said John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""We are pleased that Huntsville Utilities is now working with HUD to remove any unnecessary barriers.""
The settlement agreement is not an admission by Huntsville Utilities of any violation of the Fair Housing Act. Huntsville Utilities voluntarily entered into the settlement agreement to demonstrate its commitment to conduct its activities in compliance with the requirements of the Fair Housing Act.
""Huntsville Utilities is committed to non-discrimination in providing the best service to all its customers,"" said William Pippin, President and CEO of Huntsville Utilities. ""We fully cooperated with HUD's investigation because we take our leadership responsibility seriously and want to serve as a positive role model in our community.""
The settlement stems from a complaint initiated by HUD after testing conducted by the Fair Housing Center of Northern Alabama, a HUD-funded fair housing agency, indicated that callers seeking to become residential customers of Huntsville Utilities received different treatment based on Hispanic national origin. A Hispanic tester was told that she must apply in person, while a non-Hispanic tester was given the option to apply in person or online through the company's Web site.
Under the settlement agreement, which will be in effect for three years, Huntsville Utilities will adopt a non-discriminatory service policy, develop and publish a list of alternative eligibility or identification documents that do not rely solely on Social Security numbers and clarify which identity documents are required to qualify for service. The company will develop plans to market its services to prospective customers with limited English proficiency and to provide translation services.
Huntsville Utilities will also administer fair housing training to its employees and conduct periodic testing to ensure that it is offering its services to every applicant equally, regardless of national origin. In addition, the company will donate $5,000 to a local Alabama non-profit organization that serves the Latino community.
HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, with its partners in the Fair Housing Assistance Program, investigates approximately 10,000 housing discrimination complaints annually. People who believe they have experienced or witnessed unlawful housing discrimination should contact HUD at 1-800-669-9777 (voice).

The funding will also link the elderly and people with disabilities with supportive services that allow them to maintain independent living and age-in-place. Read more about local impact of HUD's grant funding.
HUD's Resident Opportunities and Self Sufficiency - Service Coordinators Program (ROSS-SC) helps public housing authorities, resident associations, non-profit organizations, Indian tribes or entities representing Indian tribes hire or retain ""service coordinators"" who work directly with residents to assess their needs and connect them with education, job training and placement programs and/or computer and financial literacy services available in their community to promote self-sufficiency. For an elderly or disabled resident, the service coordinator arranges supportive services that allow them to maintain their independence.
""These service coordinators will help thousands of public housing residents connect to jobs and opportunities that lead to self-sufficiency and improved quality of life,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan.
The purpose of HUD's ROSS-SC program is to encourage local, innovative strategies that link public housing assistance with public and private resources to enable participating families to increase earned income; reduce or eliminate the need for welfare assistance; and make progress toward achieving economic independence and housing self-sufficiency."

08/16/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-132.cfm,"HUD Launches ""Innovation of the Day""","WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development launched Innovation of the Day, a new online platform that will collect and share innovative practices in affordable housing, community development, and urban planning from around the world. Its purpose is to seek new ideas that can be leveraged not only within HUD, but among other agencies, communities, philanthropic organizations, non-profit agencies, and the public.
Innovation of the Day aims to discover and analyze emerging trends, issues, and solutions from the field to federal policymaking. This new platform will connect local HUD and regional offices with private, public, and non-profits so that they may collaborate and share their experiences, practices and resources on ways to strengthen local communities.
""Innovation of the Day is a tool to form partnerships and invite new and bold ideas to stimulate uncommon solutions to our everyday problems,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""As an organization, HUD is embracing innovation that can have a profound and lasting impact in unexpected and exciting ways.""
The new platform will consist of a submission form and innovations database for use by anyone, ranging from the general public to researchers. The site will feature select innovations highlighting some of best innovations HUD receives. The site will also include a dashboard to reveal trends such as geography or innovation theme.

08/20/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-133.cfm,HUD Charges Minnesota Mobile Home Park Owners and Manager with Discriminating Against Mexican American Couple,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is charging the owners and manager of Rainbow Terrace Mobile Home Park in Albert Lea, Minnesota, with violating the Fair Housing Act by making discriminatory statements about the national origin of a Mexican American couple that was trying to lease a park lot. HUD's charge alleges that the park's manager stated that she did ""not want any more Mexicans"" living at the mobile home park because they were ""too much trouble"" or similar words to that effect. The manager also allegedly told the wife that her husband was ""no good"" and referred to him with an ethnic slur for people who are Mexican or Mexican-American.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in housing transactions based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, or disability.
""Discrimination has no home in America. Mobile home residents do not have to accept derogatory statements based on their national origin when trying to rent,"" stated John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD is committed to combating all violations of the Fair Housing Act.""
HUD's charge alleges that while the wife and her sister were meeting with the manager of Rainbow Terrace about renting a lot, the manager observed the husband sitting in a nearby pickup truck and asked the wife if he was her husband. When the wife said yes, the manager asked if he was Mexican or from Mexico. When the wife confirmed that her husband is Mexican, the manager allegedly said that she had had ""enough of [them] here"" and did ""not want any more."" The manager then allegedly asked the wife if she had a Social Security card and if she was born in the United States, saying that she did ""not want any more Mexicans [living at Rainbow Terrace]"" because they were ""too much trouble."" She also referred to Mexicans with an ethnically disparaging slang word.
HUD's investigation found evidence showing that other Mexican American residents of the park had been subjected to similar ethnic slurs by the manager. Several residents told HUD that the manager had used the ethnically derogatory term in referring to persons of Mexican origin.
A United States Administrative Law Judge will hear HUD's charge unless any party elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages to the complainants. In addition, the judge may impose fines to vindicate the public interest, order injunctive and other equitable relief to deter further discrimination, and require payment of attorney fees. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages to the aggrieved persons.
HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, with its partners in the Fair Housing Assistance Program, investigates approximately 10,000 housing discrimination complaints annually. People who believe they have experienced or witnessed unlawful housing discrimination should contact HUD at 1-800-669-9777 (voice), or 1-800-927-9275 (TTY).

08/22/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-135.cfm,New HUD Study Finds Affordable Housing Remains Affordable 15 Years after Low Income Housing Tax Credits Take Effect,"WASHINGTON - Since its inception, the nation's Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) Program helped produce more than 2.2 million affordable apartments, accounting for roughly one-third of all multi-family rental housing constructed between 1987 and 2006. A new report by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (www.huduser.org/portal/publications/hsgfin/lihtc_report2012.html) finds that after an initial 15-year required 'affordability period,' the vast majority of these LIHTC properties remain affordable for working families.
However, the HUD-commissioned report cautions that once all additional state and local use restrictions expire in the years to come, more than a million units of affordable housing could become market-rate properties that lower income families may no longer be able to afford.
""This report is a wakeup call to all of us interested in preserving our nation's affordable housing,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""As LIHTC properties age, especially in high-cost areas with escalating market demand, State Housing Finance Agencies must do everything they can to protect the opportunities for working families to live in neighborhoods they might otherwise not be able to afford.""
As time goes on, thousands of properties financed using the LIHTC program are becoming eligible to end the program's rent and income restrictions, prompting HUD's Office of Policy Development and Research to commission this study. In the worst-case scenario, more than a million LIHTC units could leave the affordable housing stock by 2020, a potentially serious setback to efforts to provide housing for low-income households. Based on interviews with syndicators, LIHTC property owners, and industry experts, as well as analysis of HUD's LIHTC database and market research, this worst-case scenario is unlikely. The answer to the question of whether older LIHTC properties continue to provide affordable housing for low-income renters is a 'qualified yes.'
Most LIHTC properties remain affordable despite having passed the 15-year use restrictions mandated by the Internal Revenue Service. In addition to federal affordability requirements, many LIHTC developments, including those placed in service between 1987 and 1994, are subject to other use restrictions that last well beyond Year 15. After Year 15, properties take one of three paths: they remain affordable without recapitalization; they remain affordable with a major new source of subsidy; or they are converted to market-rate housing.
Conclusions and Recommendations for Policy Makers
Most older LIHTC properties are not at risk of becoming unaffordable, the notable exceptions being properties with for-profit owners in favorable market locations. State Housing Finance Agencies (HFAs) will come under great pressure as the large stock of LIHTC housing ages. Restricted by finite resources, state policy-makers are going to have to make choices. HUD's report recommends that those choices be made on the basis of a set of guiding principles and on careful examination of the housing markets in which the older LIHTC stock within their state operates. The study's authors suggest that HFAs should place the highest priority on the developments that are most likely to be repositioned in the market—as higher-rent housing or conversion to homeownership or another use."
08/24/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-136.cfm,"HUD Orders West Virginia Landlord to Pay $34,000 for Discriminating Against Man with Autism and His Sister","WASHINGTON - A West Virginia woman caring for her brother who has autism knew something was wrong when she tried to rent an apartment in Charleston from landlord Michael Corey in 2009. The landlord demanded that before he would sign a lease agreement, the woman must purchase a $1 million insurance policy to cover any damages or injuries caused by her brother and sign an agreement assuming all legal liability for her brother's actions. In addition, the landlord required the woman to obtain a doctor's note regarding her brother's condition. The woman, believing she was being discriminated against, filed a fair housing complaint with HUD.
Following two initial decisions by HUD Administrative Law Judges, HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan found that the landlord violated the Fair Housing Act and ordered him to pay $34,000, which includes $18,000 in damages to the woman and $16,000 in civil penalties to the government.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to deny housing or impose different rental terms and conditions based on disability, race, national origin, color, religion, sex, or familial status.
""The order reaffirms HUD's commitment to protecting the rights of persons with disabilities,"" stated John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""No one trying to find a place to call home should be held to a different standard or required to meet additional obligations because they have a disability.""
HUD found that in April 2009, the woman responded to an advertisement in the Charleston Ad Bulletin for a house for rent. After the woman informed the landlord that her brother had been diagnosed with autism, the landlord required her to purchase the $1 million insurance policy, sign a document assuming all legal liability, and obtain a doctor's note before he would consider renting to her. The landlord admitted at trial that he does not require non-disabled applicants to meet the same requirements and acknowledged that it was his belief that ""persons diagnosed with autism and mental retardation pose a greater risk in terms of liability."" HUD determined that although the landlord had never met the woman's brother, he worried that the brother, because he has autism, would start a fire or attack neighbors.
The woman, who is the legal guardian and primary caretaker of her brother, stated, ""My brother's one of the most loving persons you'll ever meet. He's a human being and the idea he would harm anyone else brings me to tears.""

08/27/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-134.cfm,HUD Narrows Field in Neighborhood Transformation Competition,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced today that nine applicants are finalists to compete for approximately $110 million in 2012 Choice Neighborhoods Implementation grants to transform public and other HUD-assisted housing in targeted neighborhoods.
The entities below, selected from a pool of 42 applicants, will compete for individual grants up to $30 million. HUD anticipates naming four to five Implementation Grant recipients later in this year.
""I applaud these finalists and all of the applicants who committed an extraordinary amount of energy and effort on plans to create better housing and even greater neighborhoods,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""Choice Neighborhoods stands at the center of the Obama Administration's effort to transform distressed communities into neighborhoods of opportunity that include quality affordable housing, good schools and safe.""
HUD's Choice Neighborhoods Initiative (CN) promotes a comprehensive approach to transforming distressed areas of concentrated poverty into viable and sustainable mixed-income neighborhoods. Building on the successes of HUD's HOPE VI Program, Choice Neighborhoods links housing improvements with necessary services for the people who live there - including schools, public transit and employment opportunities.
The nine finalists completed a comprehensive local planning process and are ready to move forward with their Transformation Plan to redevelop their target neighborhoods. In the coming weeks, HUD evaluation teams will visit the targeted housing and neighborhoods and meet with the applicants and partners to get a clear understanding of their individual Transformation Plans. The evaluation team will ensure the applicants are committed and capable of implementing the neighborhood transformation as described in their application.
Site visits are part of HUD's CN Implementation Grant application review process to determine which of the finalists will receive grants. The location of the applicants is not an indication of the location targeted for redevelopment. Opening the site visits to the public or revealing the location of the targeted housing or neighborhood at this stage is not permitted under the statute governing HUD's process to award competitive grants. Following the visits, HUD may also request that applicants respond to technical clarification questions.
These finalists were ranked on how well their vision addressed Choice Neighborhoods' three core goals:
Housing: Transform distressed public and assisted housing into energy efficient, mixed-income housing that is physically and financially viable over the long-term; People: Support positive outcomes for families who live in the target development(s) and the surrounding neighborhood, particularly outcomes related to residents' health, safety, employment, mobility, and education; and Neighborhood: Transform neighborhoods of poverty into viable, mixed-income neighborhoods with access to well-functioning services, high quality public schools and education programs, high quality early learning programs and services, public assets, public transportation, and improved access to jobs.
• Housing: Transform distressed public and assisted housing into energy efficient, mixed-income housing that is physically and financially viable over the long-term;
• People: Support positive outcomes for families who live in the target development(s) and the surrounding neighborhood, particularly outcomes related to residents' health, safety, employment, mobility, and education; and
• Neighborhood: Transform neighborhoods of poverty into viable, mixed-income neighborhoods with access to well-functioning services, high quality public schools and education programs, high quality early learning programs and services, public assets, public transportation, and improved access to jobs.
The Choice Neighborhoods Initiative is a centerpiece of the Obama Administration's interagency Neighborhood Revitalization Initiative (www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/oua/initiatives/neighborhood-revitalization) - a collaboration between the Departments of Housing and Urban Development, Education, Justice, Treasury and Health and Human Services to support the ability of local leaders from the public and private sectors and attract the private investment needed to transform distressed neighborhoods into sustainable, mixed-income neighborhoods with the affordable housing, safe streets and good schools every family needs.
Congress approved the Choice Neighborhoods Initiative with the passage of HUD's FY2010 budget. With the FY 2010 and 2011 funds, last year, HUD awarded its first Choice Neighborhoods Implementation grants to Chicago, Boston, New Orleans, San Francisco and Seattle that total a $122.27 million investment to bring comprehensive neighborhood revitalization to blighted areas in these cities. HUD has also awarded $7.6 million in Choice Neighborhoods Planning grants to 30 communities to help them craft comprehensive, community-driven plans."
08/28/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-138.cfm,"HUD Approves $55 Million Mortgage to Renovate and Expand Ellis Hospital in Schenectady, New York","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced a commitment to insure a mortgage loan to Ellis Hospital in Schenectady, New York. The $54.8 million loan is made possible through the Federal Housing Administration's (FHA) Section 241 Supplemental Mortgage Insurance Program.
Ellis Hospital is a multi-campus, not-for-profit healthcare provider with hospitals, clinics, and physician offices located throughout the Schenectady region. Ellis has two existing FHA-insured mortgages through the Federal Housing Administration's (FHA) Section 242 Hospital Mortgage Insurance Program.
The FHA-insured mortgage loan will consolidate two existing emergency departments into one by expanding Ellis Hospital's Nott Street emergency department while also adding a 208 car parking structure. The project will make the department more efficient and improve the delivery of emergency care service to the community.
""By helping to make these projects possible, FHA is not only helping to modernize health care facilities, it is also contributing to the financial well-being of communities by enabling investments that create jobs and support local economies,"" said FHA Acting Commissioner Carol Galante.
HUD estimates the Ellis Hospital construction project will support more than 450 full-time jobs and provide an economic boost of more than $177 million to the community. HUD's estimates are based on results from an economic model used by public and private institutions to examine a variety of economic development issues.
By insuring the mortgage loan, FHA is enabling the hospital to obtain lower cost financing that will save an estimated $17.5 million in interest costs over the life of the loan. Since 1968, FHA has insured 401 mortgage loans totaling $17.4 billion to hospitals in 43 states and Puerto Rico.
FHA's Section 242 Mortgage Insurance Program for Hospitals provides HUD-insured mortgages made by private lending institutions to finance construction or renovation of acute care hospitals including major equipment needed to operate the facility. Eligible applicants can be public, proprietary, or nonprofit hospitals certified by the responsible State agency."
08/28/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-140.cfm,United States Reaches Lending Discrimination Settlement with GFI Mortgage Bankers Inc.,"Preet Bharara, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Thomas E. Perez, the Assistant Attorney General for the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division, and John Trasviña, Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (""HUD""), announced today that GFI Mortgage Bankers Inc., a large independent home mortgage firm that concentrates on the New York, New Jersey, and Florida markets, will pay $3.555 million to resolve a lending discrimination lawsuit filed by the Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York. The lawsuit alleges that GFI engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination by pricing residential mortgage loans for qualified African-American and Hispanic borrowers higher than for similarly qualified non-Hispanic white borrowers between 2005 and 2009. The consent order, which was filed in federal court in Manhattan - where GFI is headquartered - was approved today by U.S. District Judge Katherine B. Forrest.
Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara stated: ""With the settlement we announce today, the hundreds of victims of lending discrimination committed by GFI will be made whole, and the company has admitted the conduct that led to this lawsuit, and agreed to reform its residential lending practices. The swift resolution of this case demonstrates the commitment of this Office and of the entire Department of Justice to aggressively enforcing the laws against discriminatory lending, and to holding accountable those who engage in this illegal conduct.""
Assistant Attorney General for DOJ's Civil Rights Division Thomas E. Perez said: ""The Justice Department will not hesitate to litigate against lenders to enforce federal fair lending laws where the evidence warrants and to obtain compensation for borrowers who were victims of unlawful lending practices. This department is determined to address discriminatory lending practices and to ensure equal credit opportunity for all borrowers in the years to come. We also greatly appreciate our strong partnership with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, which worked jointly with the department to prosecute this case.""
HUD Assistant Secretary John Trasviña said: ""No prospective home buyer should be saddled with a higher cost mortgage because of their race or national origin. This type of practice has no place in the mortgage market. HUD and the Justice Department have made a vigorous commitment to ending unlawful lending discrimination.""
The settlement provides $3.5 million - full compensation - to approximately 600 African-American and Hispanic GFI borrowers identified by the United States as having paid more for a loan based on their race or national origin than similarly situated non-Hispanic white borrowers, and it requires GFI to pay the maximum $55,000 civil penalty allowed by the Fair Housing Act. The settlement also requires GFI to develop and implement new policies that limit the pricing discretion of its loan officers, to document its loan pricing decisions, and to monitor loan prices for race and national origin disparities not justified by objective borrower credit characteristics or loan features.
As part of the settlement, GFI admits that an analysis of the interest rates for notes, and fees that it charged, on mortgage loans to qualified borrowers showed statistically significant disparities between non-Hispanic white borrowers and both African-American and Hispanic borrowers that could not be explained by objective borrower characteristics or loan product features. The company also admitted that it provided financial incentives to its loan officers to charge higher interest rates and fees to borrowers, and that it did not have fair lending training and monitoring programs in place to prevent those interest rate and fee disparities from occurring.
Mr. Bharara thanked the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, which referred the GFI matter to the Justice Department in June 2010 for a potential pattern or practice of discrimination.
The case was handled jointly by the Civil Rights Unit of the U.S. Attorney's Office and the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jean-David Barnea and David J. Kennedy handled the case with Department of Justice Civil Rights Division attorneys Jon M. Seward, Sameena Shina Majeed, Burtis M. Dougherty, and Daniel Mosteller.
Today's announcement is part of efforts underway by President Obama's Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force (FFETF) which was created in November 2009 to wage an aggressive, coordinated and proactive effort to investigate and prosecute financial crimes. With more than 20 federal agencies, 94 U.S. attorneys' offices and state and local partners, it's the broadest coalition of law enforcement, investigatory and regulatory agencies ever assembled to combat fraud. Since its formation, the task force has made great strides in facilitating increased investigation and prosecution of financial crimes; enhancing coordination and cooperation among federal, state and local authorities; addressing discrimination in the lending and financial markets and conducting outreach to the public, victims, financial institutions and other organizations. Over the past three fiscal years, the Justice Department has filed more than 10,000 financial fraud cases against nearly 15,000 defendants including more than 2,700 mortgage fraud defendants. For more information on the task force, visit www.stopfraud.gov.
A copy of the complaint and proposed consent order, as well as additional information about fair lending enforcement by the Justice Department, can be obtained from the Justice Department website at www.justice.gov/fairhousing.
The proposed settlement provides for an independent administrator to contact and distribute payments of compensation at no cost to borrowers whom the Justice Department identifies as victims of GFI's discrimination. Borrowers who are eligible for compensation from the settlement will be contacted by the administrator. The department will make a public announcement and post contact information on its website once the administrator begins contacting victims. Individuals who believe that they may have been victims of lending discrimination by GFI and have questions about the settlement may email the department at gfisettlement@usdoj.gov, call 1-800-896-7743, or write to the following address:

09/04/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-143.cfm,HUD Issues Updated Guidance to Help Housing Providers Reduce Childhood Lead Poisoning,"WASHINGTON - To help ensure families protect their children from lead poisoning, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced new Guidelines on how to identify and control lead-based paint and related hazards in housing, and to help property owners, government agencies, and private contractors sharply reduce childhood exposure to lead without unnecessarily increasing the cost of renovation. This second edition of the Guidelines replaces the 1995 edition.
""HUD is committed to providing healthier housing for all families,"" said Jon L. Gant, Director of HUD's Office of Healthy Homes and Lead Hazard Control. ""These Guidelines will help communities around the nation protect families from lead exposure and other significant health and safety hazards.""
The Guidelines for the Evaluation and Control of Lead-Based Paint Hazards in Housing support HUD's vision to reduce hazards in housing in a cost-effect manner while protecting the health of children. The Guidelines apply to lead hazard evaluation and control in all federally associated housing.
These Guidelines can be used by those who are required to identify and control lead paint hazards, as well as property owners, landlords, and child-care center operators. They offer helpful advice on renovations in older housing, lead-based paint inspections and risk assessments, and where to go for help. The Guidelines also outline what users have to do to meet requirements and recommendations; identify training - and if applicable, certification - required for people who conduct the work; and describe how the work should be done.
The Guidelines complement regulations that have been issued by HUD, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and policies from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

09/04/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-145.cfm,HUD Charges Florida Homeowners Association and Its Management Company with Discriminating Against Family with Six Children,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is charging a Gibsonton, FL, homeowners association and its Tampa-based former management company with violating the Fair Housing Act by subjecting a family to different rental terms and conditions because they have six children. HUD's charge alleges that Townhomes of Kings LakeHomeowners Association (HOA), Inc., and Vanguard Management Group, Inc., violated the Fair Housing Act by telling the family that they had too many people living in their rental townhouse and threatening to evict them if they didn't reduce the number of occupants based on an occupancy policy that permitted only six people to live in a four-bedroom home.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to deny housing or impose different rental terms and conditions based on disability, race, national origin, color, religion, sex, or familial status. Overly restrictive occupancy policies may unlawfully discriminate against families with children by preventing them from living in a home.
HUD's investigation revealed that Kings Lake HOA's occupancy policy prevents a significant percentage of Florida families from living in its housing.The occupancy ordinance in Hillsborough County, which includes Gibsonton, would permit up to eleven occupants in the townhome.
""Homeowners associations and management companies have an obligation to ensure that their occupancy standards do not violate the Fair Housing Act,"" said John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD is committed to taking action against anyone who unlawfully denies housing to families because of the number of children in the family.""
According to HUD's charge, the family signed a one-year agreement to lease a home at the Townhomes of Kings Lake development. After the family moved in, Kings Lake's manager told the family about the homeowners association's occupancy policies and stated that the family's six children made them out of compliance with the policy. Three months later, the family received a letter from the homeowners association's attorney informing them that King's Lake would begin eviction proceedings if they didn't comply with the county's occupancy standards within 30 days. The HOA agreed to stay the eviction while HUD investigated the family's complaint. The family remained in the townhouse for another year before purchasing a home and moving out. HUD's investigation revealed that the policy remains in place.
HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, with its partners in the Fair Housing Assistance Program, investigates approximately 10,000 housing discrimination complaints annually. People who believe they have experienced or witnessed unlawful housing discrimination should contact HUD at (800) 669-9777 (voice), or (800) 927-9275 (TTY).

09/07/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-146.cfm,"HUD Obtains $20,000 'Maternity Discrimination' Settlement for California Family","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today a $20,000 settlement with Land Home Financial Services (LHFS) to resolve allegations the lender violated the Fair Housing Act by refusing to approve a Discovery Bay, California couple's mortgage application because the wife was on maternity leave.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in the sale, rental, and financing of dwellings, and in other housing-related transactions, based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, and disability. Refusing to approve a mortgage loan or provide refinancing because a woman is pregnant or on maternity leave violates the Fair Housing Act's prohibitions against sex and familial status discrimination.
""This settlement is part of a series of HUD enforcement actions across the country to address denials of home loans to women because they are pregnant or on maternity leave,"" said John Trasviña, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""We will continue to pursue maternity leave discrimination until it is eliminated.""
The couple claimed they applied for the mortgage and received a loan pre-approval letter. However, after the wife gave birth, LHFS required her to return to work and earn a full two-week paycheck by the time escrow closed on the loan. Consequently, in order to obtain the loan, she terminated her maternity leave early and returned to work just 19 days after the birth of her child.
Under the terms of the Conciliation Agreement, LHFS will pay the couple $20,000. LHFS will also ensure that its underwriting polices conform to Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) guidelines with regard to treatment of maternity and pregnancy leave income.

These philanthropic organizations often work without much recognition—until now. Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), in partnership with the Council on Foundations, announced the first winners of a new awards program to recognize community foundations for the excellent work they do along with their public partners in the areas of housing and community development.
The new HUD Secretary's Award for Community Foundations (www.huduser.org/portal/research/CommFndAwards_2012_Intro.html) honors community foundations that work closely with the public sector on projects involving housing and neighborhood improvements, education, health and recreation, transportation, community participation, arts and culture, public safety, sustainability, and economic development.
""From offering free dental care to public school students in Oregon to turning foreclosed homes into affordable housing in Boston, the organizations we honor today are redefining what it means to give back,"" said HUD Deputy Secretary Maurice Jones, who delivered the awards in New Orleans. ""On behalf of HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan I congratulate these foundations on creating positive change by bringing together public and private partners to find lasting solutions to the issues facing our diverse communities.""
""The 10 awardees, and all our community foundation members, represent lives improved, neighborhoods saved, jobs created, people trained, kids educated, and homes built,"" said Vikki N. Spruill, president and CEO of the Council on Foundations. ""Philanthropy is hard at work investing in America's communities, addressing challenges head on, and innovating for a better future.""
A jury selected one community foundation from each of HUD's 10 regions. Awards were given to community foundations for completed or ongoing initiatives that are executed in partnership with a local, regional, or federal government agency. The winners are:

With the acceptance of these disaster plans, the real work of long-term disaster recovery throughout Alabama can now begin.
Provided through HUD's Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program, these grants will support long-term disaster recovery efforts in local communities devastated by last year's disasters.
""Now that these plans are in place, it's time to get down to the real business of rebuilding the housing and infrastructure damaged by last year's tornadoes,"" said Edward Jennings, Jr., HUD's Southeast Regional Administrator. ""These communities can now begin to implement these plans and start making their neighborhoods whole again.""
On November 18, 2011, Congress appropriated $300 million in CDBG funds to support long-term disaster recovery in the most impacted and distressed areas resulting from a major disaster in 2011 (Public Law 112-55). Concurrently, Congress gave HUD the authority to allocate up to an additional $100 million for the recovery efforts. Secretary Shaun Donovan exercised HUD's full authority by targeting the maximum amount of CDBG funding allowed toward helping these most impacted state and local areas.
These funds are intended to confront unmet housing, business and infrastructure needs beyond those addressed by other forms of public and private assistance. Using a combination of federal data from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Small Business Administration (SBA), HUD identified those states and local communities most impacted and requiring the greatest assistance to recover due to the devastating tornadoes in the Southeast and Missouri; the remnants of Hurricanes Irene and Lee in the Northeast and New England; severe flooding in parts of North Dakota; and destructive wildfires in Texas.
Earlier this year, HUD allocated $24,697,966 to the State of Alabama to support long-term disaster recovery in several hard-hit counties. In addition, HUD is providing $16,634,702 to City of Tuscaloosa; $7,847,084 to Jefferson County; and $6,386,326 to the City of Birmingham to further support local recovery activities.

09/13/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-153.cfm,"HUD and VA Team Up to Win Coveted ""Sammie"" Award","WASHINGTON - One day last spring, Mark Johnston was walking to work when he came upon a homeless man and while most people would walk on, Mark stopped and helped the man find stable housing and needed services. Mark is the Acting Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. His office is responsible for, among other programs, managing more than $2 billion through programs designed to help homeless individuals and families.
Mark, along with Ann Oliva and Laure Rawson, work closely with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) as part of an ambitious national goal of ending veteran homelessness by 2015. Tonight, Mark and Susan Angell, VA's Executive Director, Homeless Veterans Initiative and their teams will be awarded the prestigious Samuel J. Heyman Service to America Medal (http://servicetoamericamedals.org/honorees/view_profile.php?profile=307) by the Partnership for Public Service
Mark and Susan, along with their respective teams, earned a coveted ""Sammie Award"" for their leadership in cutting veteran homelessness 12 percent in just one year.
""Whether it's his strategic vision or his personal touch, Mark is a model for what public service is all about,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""Mark is the type of person who not only oversees policies to try and get people off the streets but at the same time approaches homeless men and women to offer help. He is literally helping to end homelessness one person at a time.""
""Winning this award is not only an honor for me but for the team of people who have made it their mission to end homelessness. This award not only represents the combined daily efforts of hundreds of employees at HUD and VA but the work of local providers in communities nationwide,"" said Mark. ""We are making headway and each and every day moving closer to ending the tragedy of having our nations' heroes sleep on the street.""
Along with Angell's team at VA, Mark, Ann and Laure are working to ensure homeless veterans and their families receive housing and support services through the HUD-VA Supportive Housing Program (HUD-VASH). Each agency joined forces to figure out how they could use existing programs with HUD-VASH to connect homeless veterans with permanent housing and the services they need.
Through this program, HUD provides targeted housing assistance to homeless veterans while VA offers case management and supportive services. Together, the drop in veteran homelessness is measureable. Read more about progress being made to reduce veteran homelessness in America (www.va.gov/opa/pressrel/pressrelease.cfm?id=2234).
HUD and VA's work also includes the Rapid Results Housing Boot Camps (https://www.usich.gov/media_center/blog/rapid_results/), which brings communities together to set ambitious but common sense goals to help homeless veterans to find housing. The Service to America Medal winners were nominated by colleagues familiar with their work and selected by a committee that includes nearly 20 leaders in government, academia, the private sector, media and philanthropy. More than 400 nominations were submitted for the medal consideration this year."

Data continues to show signs that the housing market is strengthening - as home price improvements in the first half of this year have helped lift 1.3 million families above water - although officials caution that the overall recovery remains fragile. The full Housing Scorecard is available online at www.hud.gov/scorecard.
""The Obama Administration's efforts to speed housing recovery are showing clear signs of traction as the scorecard indicators highlight market momentum not seen since before the housing crisis,"" said HUD Acting Assistant Secretary Erika Poethig. ""With median sales prices the highest they've been since the earliest months of the Administration, underwater borrowers down by 11 percent since the end of last year and more than half a million refinances through our enhanced Home Affordable Refinance Program so far this year, it is clear that we're making progress. But with so many households still struggling to make ends meet, we have important work ahead. That is why we are asking the Congress to approve the President's refinancing proposal so that more homeowners can receive assistance.""
Also featured this month in the Administration's Making Home Affordable Program Report (www.treasury.gov/initiatives/financial-stability/reports/Pages/Making-Home-Affordable-Program-Performance-Report.aspx) are detailed assessments for the largest mortgage servicers participating in the program with results from the second quarter of 2012. The Servicer Assessments - first introduced in June 2011 and published quarterly - have set a new standard for disclosure around servicer efforts to assist struggling homeowners.
""The Making Home Affordable Program has established critical standards that have changed the way the mortgage industry does business, leading to relief for millions of struggling homeowners,"" said Treasury Assistant Secretary for Financial Stability Tim Massad. ""By shining a spotlight on individual servicer performance in key areas, and requiring improvements through our compliance process, the nation's largest mortgage servicers are fixing their processes while being held publicly accountable.""
The August Housing Scorecard features key data on the health of the housing market and the impact of the Administration's foreclosure prevention programs, including:
The Administration's foreclosure programs are providing relief for millions of homeowners as we continue to recover from an unprecedented housing crisis. More than 1.2 million homeowner assistance actions have taken place through the Making Home Affordable Program, while the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) has offered more than 1.4 million loss mitigation and early delinquency interventions. The Administration's programs continue to encourage improved standards and processes in the industry, with HOPE Now lenders offering families and individuals more than three million proprietary mortgage modifications through July. Homeowners entering HAMP continue to benefit from deep and sustainable assistance. As of July, more than one million homeowners have received a permanent HAMP modification, saving approximately $538 on their mortgage payments each month, and an estimated $14.4 billion to date. In July, 77 percent of homeowners with eligible non-GSE mortgages benefitted from principal reduction with their HAMP modification. Eighty-seven percent of homeowners entering the program in the last two years have received a permanent modification.

Since inception of the Making Home Affordable Program, Treasury has required participating servicers to take specific actions to improve their processes through ongoing program reviews. The latest Servicer Assessments summarize performance on metrics in three categories of program implementation: identifying and contacting homeowners; homeowner evaluation and assistance; and program reporting, management and governance. Results for the second quarter of 2012 show that servicers are focusing attention on areas identified in previous program reviews and, as a result, are demonstrating significant improvement in program implementation:
Mortgage servicers show continued improvement in calculating homeowner income, which is used to determine a homeowner's eligibility and modified payment amount under the program. In the second quarter, the average income calculation error rate for the top servicers fell below two percent and two servicers had zero percent error rates. Servicers are more effectively evaluating homeowners under program eligibility criteria as seen in the ""second look disagree"" category, which reflects the rate at which Treasury's program reviews disagree with the servicers' decision to find a homeowner ineligible for assistance. In the second quarter, the average second look disagree percentage for the top servicers remained below one percent with two servicers having a zero percent disagree rate for the quarter.

For the second quarter of 2012, two servicers were found to need only minor improvement on the areas reviewed for program performance, while seven servicers were found to need moderate improvement. Although servicer performance in a particular compliance category can fluctuate from quarter to quarter, in general, servicers continue to show overall improvement. All servicers, however, will need to continue to demonstrate progress in areas identified in follow-up program reviews."
09/21/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-155.cfm,HUD Announces Nationwide Job Grants,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today awarded $75 million in grants to help public and assisted housing residents connect with local services to obtain education and training to find jobs. The funding allows grantees across the U.S., the District of Columbia, Guam, the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico to retain or hire 1,500 service coordinators to work directly with HUD-assisted families to connect them to the supportive services that meet their individual needs to become gainfully employed. See local impact of HUD funding here.
""This funding ultimately links individuals to childcare, computer access, job training and other basic skills individuals need to compete for jobs that pay a living wage,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""To continue to grow America's economy, we must see to it that every American has the skills and resources they need to become gainfully employed.""
The funding announced today includes $15 million through the Public Housing-Family Self-Sufficiency Program (PH-FSS); and $60 million through the Housing Choice Voucher-Family Self-Sufficiency Program (HCV-FSS).
The service coordinators, retained or hired through both of these programs, work directly with residents to connect them with local organizations that provide education and job training and placement opportunities; as well as childcare, counseling, transportation and computer and financial literacy services available in their community. Both programs encourage innovative strategies that link public housing and Housing Choice Voucher assistance with other resources to enable participating families to find employment; increase earned income; reduce or eliminate the need for rental and/or welfare assistance; and make progress toward achieving economic independence and housing self-sufficiency.
Participants in both programs sign a five-year contract that requires the head of the household to obtain employment and no longer receive welfare assistance at the end of the five-year term. As the family's income rises, a portion of that increased income is deposited in an interest-bearing escrow account. If the family successfully completes its FSS contract, the family receives the escrow funds that it can use for any purpose, including paying educational expenses, starting a business or paying debts.
The Family Self Sufficiency (FSS) Program is a long-standing resource for increasing economic security and self-sufficiency among participants. HUD's Office of Policy Development and Research issued Evaluation of FSS Program: Prospective Study (www.huduser.org/portal/publications/affhsg/eval_fssp.html) in 2011 that evaluated the effectiveness of the FSS Program. Conducted from 2005 to 2009, the study showed that financial benefits are substantial for participants who remain and complete the program. This study is the second of a three-part series that evaluates the effects of the FSS program. The first study (www.huduser.org/portal/publications/econdev/selfsufficiency.html) found individuals who participated in the FSS program fared better financially than those who did not enroll in the program.
PD&R is currently working on a follow-up evaluation to the Prospective Study that tracks the outcomes of people who were still enrolled in the program at the end of the study. The third and final study looks at the effectiveness of the FSS program nationally. This will be the first national study of the FSS program and is part of HUD's Transformation Initiative that uses metrics and research to evaluate programs and gauge performance to encourage more transparency and accountability within the agency."
09/21/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-156.cfm,FHA Reminds Lenders to Speed Insurance Payments for Borrowers,"WASHINGTON - In the wake of Hurricane Isaac in Louisiana and Mississippi last month, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) is reminding its approved lenders to quickly release hazard insurance payments so struggling families can rebuild their homes.
FHA today published a Mortgagee Letter to reinforce its existing policy requiring lenders to release insurance payouts to homeowners eager to rebuild their damaged homes following disaster. In the past, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) noticed some lenders would instead use these insurance funds to pay off the outstanding mortgage balance, leaving many homeowners without the resources they need to rebuild their homes.
""FHA Lenders are always required to follow our guidance and, particularly following a devastating disaster like Hurricane Isaac, it is important that FHA take affirmative steps to ensure that is the case,"" said Carol Galante, FHA's Acting Commissioner. ""By issuing this reminder today, we are confirming that these insurance payouts are intended to help rebuild a family's home.""
Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana added, ""I applaud HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan and Assistant Secretary Galante for working with us to take quick action to remind lenders of FHA's policies. This ensures that the actions of several unscrupulous mortgage lenders after Katrina will not be repeated during recovery from Isaac. It is important that homeowners themselves receive their insurance proceeds so they can begin to rebuild their homes and lives impacted by this storm.""
In its loan documents, FHA requires that the mortgage lender be named as a ""Loss Payee"" on a homeowner's hazard insurance policy. This requirement helps ensure that insurance proceeds are available once the rebuilding of a damaged property begins. It also protects lenders in the event properties cannot be rebuilt and some or all of the insurance proceeds are required to pay off the outstanding loan indebtedness.
Timely receipt of flood and hazard insurance proceeds allows homeowners to rebuild their homes and provide some stability for their families. Therefore, lenders are strongly encouraged to assist homeowners by: (1) providing copies of hazard insurance policies and information when requested; (2) promptly releasing hazard insurance claim proceeds when a viable repair plan has been approved; and (3) following standard procedures to ensure that hazard insurance claims are filed and settled in an expeditious manner.
In addition, if a lender receives funds from an insurance company for coverage of a homeowners' personal property, temporary housing, and other transition expenses, then the lender must promptly release such proceeds to the borrower. The mortgagee may not withhold disbursement of such proceeds to cover an existing arrearage without the written consent of the homeowner.
Excess hazard or flood insurance can only be used to cover arrearages and/or pay down principal if: insurance funds exceed the cost to repair the property or; insurance funds are insufficient to repair the property based upon the repair estimate, and the homeowners is unable to demonstrate that he/she has the funds necessary to cover the difference of the repair costs."
09/25/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-078a.cfm,HUD Charges Minnesota Property Owner with Discriminating Against Tenant with Disabilities,"CHICAGO - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has charged the owner of a Grand Rapids, MN, apartment complex with violating the Fair Housing Act by denying a request from a disabled woman to reside in her apartment with a medically-prescribed support animal. The owner operates the property as Jay's Hilltop Rentals.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful for a housing provider to refuse to make a reasonable accommodation in its rules, policies, practices, or services when needed to provide persons with disabilities an equal opportunity to use or enjoy a dwelling.
""HUD is committed to making sure housing providers meet their obligation to grant people with disabilities the reasonable accommodations they need,"" said HUD's Midwest Regional Administrator Antonio R. Riley.
According to HUD's charge, the tenant obtained a letter froma medical professional treating her explaining that she was disabled within the meaning of the Fair Housing Act and needed a support animal to alleviate symptoms associated with her disabilities. HUD's charge further alleges that when the tenant tried to present the letter to the property owner, he refused to read it, threw the note on the floor, and yelled at the tenant to ""get rid"" of the animal or he would ""get rid"" of the tenant. The owner later offered to let the tenant keep her support animal if she tripled her security deposit.
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages to the woman for the damages caused her by the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief to deter further discrimination, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose fines in order to vindicate the public interest. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages to aggrieved persons.
FHEO and its partners in the Fair Housing Assistance Program investigate approximately 10,000 housing discrimination complaints annually. People who believe they are victims of housing discrimination should contact HUD at 1-800-669-9777 (voice) or 1-800-927-9275 (TTY)."

The Fair Housing Act makes it illegal to discriminate in the terms and conditions of rental housing based on disability, including denying a reasonable accommodation to a person with a disability.
""Condo associations are not exempt from adherence to the Fair Housing Act,"" said Carlos Osegueda, HUD's Region IV director for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Their policies and practices cannot discriminate against persons with disabilities, and HUD will continue to take action anytime we find that they do.""
In addition to determining that the association's board unlawfully refused to allow the resident to keep her support animal, HUD's investigation revealed that some of the same board members who supported denying the resident's request had or had previously had animals in their units.
Under the agreement, Point East Three Condominium Association will allow the resident to keep her emotional support animal and pay her $18,000. In addition, the condominium association will enact a reasonable accommodation policy and obtain fair housing training for all of its board members.

HUD's charge alleges that the manager discouraged families from applying for housing by making biased statements and placing discriminatory advertising on craigslist.org.
The charge is the result of a complaint that The Fair Housing Council of Suburban Philadelphia (FHCSP) filed with HUD after testers with the non-profit fair housing organization determined that ads the manager placed discriminated against families with children. One continuous running ad the manager posted on craigslist.com stated: ""This would be a good place for a mature couple. Too many stairs for young children."" The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to make statements that express a preference or otherwise discriminate against families with children.
""The Fair Housing Act makes 'no kids allowed' policies illegal,"" said John Trasviña, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will continue to take action against owners and landlords whose policies and practices violate the law.""
In one test the manager allegedly told a FHCSP tester posing as a mother with a 5-year-old child that residents of the complex did not want noisy kids running up and down the stairs. When the tester asked to view the apartment, the manager allegedly said, ""Well, I most definitely wouldn't rent to people with children so there really is no use."" The manager told another tester posing as a married man with no children that some people with children had contacted her even though the ad clearly stated that the unit was not for children, and agreed to show him the property the next day.
A United States Administrative Law Judge will hear HUD's charge unless any party elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages to the complainant. In addition, the judge may impose fines to vindicate the public interest, order injunctive and other equitable relief to deter further discrimination, and require payment of attorney fees. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages to the aggrieved persons.

10/01/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-158.cfm,HUD Approves New Jersey Disaster Recovery Plan,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today announced the approval of the State of New Jersey's disaster recovery plan totaling $15.6 million in emergency aid to help communities throughout New Jersey, specifically Passaic County, to recover from Hurricane Irene. With the acceptance of this disaster plan, the real work of long-term disaster recovery throughout New Jersey can now begin.
Provided through HUD's Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program, these grants will support long-term disaster recovery efforts in local communities devastated by last year's disasters.
""Now that these plans are in place, it's time to get down to the real business of rebuilding the housing and infrastructure damaged by last year's terrible storms,"" said Mirza Orriols, HUD's Acting Regional Administrator. ""New Jersey and most especially Passaic County can now begin to make their neighborhoods whole again.""
On November 18, 2011, Congress appropriated $300 million in CDBG funds to support long-term disaster recovery in ""the most impacted and distressed areas"" throughout the nation. At that same time, Congress gave HUD the authority to allocate up to $100 million in additional CDBG funds to assist in the wake of last year's disasters. Secretary Shaun Donovan elected to exercise HUD's full authority by targeting the maximum amount of CDBG funding allowed toward helping states and local areas.
These funds are intended to confront unmet housing, business and infrastructure needs beyond those addressed by other forms of public and private assistance. Using a combination of federal data from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Small Business Administration (SBA), HUD identified those states and local communities most impacted and requiring the greatest assistance to recover due to the devastating tornadoes in the Southeast and Missouri; the remnants of Hurricanes Irene and Lee in the Northeast and New England; severe flooding in parts of North Dakota; and destructive wildfires in Texas.
Earlier this year, HUD allocated $15,598,506 to the State of New Jersey, at least 80 percent of which will assist Passaic County to recover from the severe impacts of Hurricane Irene.

The agreement is the result of a complaint HUD initiated against the Group after company staff allegedly failed to renew the leases of three Burmese families because of their national origin, and made statements to various people that the group would no longer accept rental referrals for refugees that were referred by Lutheran Refugee Services. The company denied the allegation.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to deny housing or impose different rental terms and conditions based on disability, race, national origin, color, religion, sex, or familial status.
""America's protection of refugees fleeing persecution from abroad includes ensuring protection against housing discrimination here,"" said John Trasviña, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will continue to take action against housing providers that unlawfully deny housing to families because of their national origin.""
Three Burmese families were notified by the company that their leases were not being renewed because of alleged lease violations. HUD's investigation showed that only the Burmese tenants received lease non-renewal letters, even though the company had similar concerns about other tenants. In addition, housing staff at the company told Lutheran Children and Family Services representatives and HUD investigators that the company would no longer rent to refugees.

In requesting the modifications, the tenant informed the landlord that all of the work would be performed by licensed contractors and that if the landlord wished, he would pay to return the unit to its original condition.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits landlords from refusing to let tenants, at their own expense, make reasonable modifications to a rental property, as well as from refusing to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services.
""At some point, a person with disabilities may need to make a modification to his or her home to make it livable,"" said Mark Brezina, HUD Regional Administrator. ""The Fair Housing Act says that if the modification is reasonable and the person is willing to pay for it, a landlord can't deny it.""
According to HUD's charge, the tenant had no disability when he initially rented the home. After developing a serious medical condition that made it necessary for him to use a wheelchair, he wrote the landlord a letter asking if he could have a ramp installed and other modifications made. His request to install a ramp was granted, but other requests, including a request to remove a shower door, install a higher toilet and lower the kitchen sink, were denied.
When the tenant renewed his request to make the modifications the owner had denied, the owner allegedly withdrew a prior offer to renew the tenant's lease and terminated his tenancy because of his disability and in retaliation for his requests to make modifications.
The HUD Charge of Discrimination will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) unless a party to the Charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court.

According to HUD's charge, the two single-story units cannot be accessed without negotiating a flight of stairs.
The Fair Housing Act requires that multifamily housing structures built for first occupancy after March 13, 1991, contain accessible features for persons with disabilities. The requirements include accessible common areas, bathrooms and kitchens, as well as wider doors and environmental controls that can be reached by persons who use wheelchairs. The failure to include these features violates the Fair Housing Act.
""For more than two decades, architects, designers, builders, and developers have had a legal obligation to comply with the Fair Housing Act's design and construction requirements,"" said Evelyn Meininger, HUD's Region VIII Director for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD is committed to enforcing the nation's fair housing laws and working to create more housing opportunities for people with disabilities.""
The two units came to HUD's attention when Montana Fair Housing, Inc., a non-profit fair housing advocacy organization, filed a complaint with the Department contending that property owner and developer Anthony Boote, general contractor Red Dog Construction, LLC, and designer Charles J. Chandler had designed and constructed the units in a way that did not meet the needs of persons with disabilities, as required by the Fair Housing Act.
HUD's investigation found that the units were further inaccessible because they have twist-knob door handles, doorways that aren't wide enough to allow passage by a person using a wheelchair, thermostats that are not in accessible locations, and bathrooms that lack reinforcements necessary to allow the later installation of grab bars.
A United States Administrative Law Judge will hear the charge unless any party elects to have the case heard in federal district court.

That is why we continue to ask Congress to approve the President's refinancing proposal so that more homeowners can secure the help they need.""
""Tens of thousands of additional families benefit from the Administration's programs every month, which offer some of the deepest assistance available to prevent foreclosures,"" said Treasury Assistant Secretary for Financial Stability Tim Massad. ""As the housing market continues to recover, we remain focused on helping eligible families access this assistance.""
The September Housing Scorecard features key data on the health of the housing market and the impact of the Administration's foreclosure prevention programs, including:
Rising home values have brought homeowner equity to its highest level since the third quarter of 2008 and helped lift 1.3 million families above water. Homeowner equity jumped $406 billion, or 5.9 percent, to $7,275 billion in the second quarter of 2012. After a sharp first quarter rise, total equity has grown to $863 billion, or 13.5 percent, since the end of 2011. The number of underwater borrowers has declined by 11 percent since the end of last year, from 12.1 million in the 4th quarter of 2011 to 10.8 million in the second quarter of 2012. The Administration's foreclosure programs are providing relief for millions of homeowners as we continue to recover from an unprecedented housing crisis. Nearly 1.3 million homeowner assistance actions have taken place through the Making Home Affordable Program, while the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) has offered more than 1.4 million loss mitigation and early delinquency interventions. The Administration's programs continue to encourage improved standards and processes in the industry, with HOPE Now lenders offering families and individuals more than three million proprietary mortgage modifications through July. Homeowners entering HAMP continue to benefit from deep and sustainable assistance. As of August, more than one million homeowners have received a permanent HAMP modification, saving approximately $539 on their mortgage payments each month, and an estimated $15 billion to date. In August, 81 percent of homeowners with eligible non-GSE mortgages benefitted from principal reduction with their HAMP modification. Eighty-seven percent of homeowners entering the program in the last two years have received a permanent modification.

10/09/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-161.cfm,HUD Grants to Help the Elderly and People with Disabilities Continue to Live Independently at Home,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Donovan today announced $31.3 million in grants to help more than 14,000 senior citizens and persons with disabilities to receive health care, meals, and other critical supportive services. The grants are awarded through HUD's Multifamily Housing Service Coordinator Program (MHSC). (See local impact here).
The grants are awarded to eligible owners of private housing developments that receive rental subsidies from HUD to house low-income individuals in 36 states and the District of Columbia. These property owners or their management companies either hire or contract service coordinators with backgrounds in providing social services, especially to the frail elderly and people with disabilities, to assist their residents with special needs.
""These service coordinators help us connect senior citizens and those living with disabilities with the services they need to live independently,"" said Donovan. ""We're getting older as a nation and these grants go a long way toward ensuring these vulnerable populations are well served and allowed to age in place.""
The grants are awarded today are designed for an initial three-year period to allow eligible owners of multifamily housing for the elderly or disabled, to hire and support a service coordinator. The funds cover such costs as salary, benefits, quality assurance, training, office space, equipment, and other related administrative expenses. A 2008 HUD report (www.huduser.org/portal/publications/hsgspec/serv_coord.html) found aging in place reduces rates of premature institutionalization for low-income elderly residents, thus reducing the costs borne by taxpayers.
As the U.S. population ages and the number of older Americans grows, there will be an increased need for programs to help very low-income elderly persons to continue living independently in their homes. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, there were 35 million people age 65 years or older in the U.S. in 2000, and it estimates that by 2050 that number will climb to 80 million.

10/09/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-163.cfm,"Manhattan U.S. Attorney Files Mortgage Fraud Lawsuit Against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. Seeking Hundreds of Millions of Dollars in Damages for Fraudulently Certified Loans","Preet Bharara, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Helen Kanovsky, General Counsel of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (""HUD""), and David A. Montoya, Inspector General of HUD, announced today that the United States has filed a civil mortgage fraud lawsuit against WELLS FARGO BANK, N.A. (""WELLS FARGO""). The Government's Complaint seeks damages and civil penalties under the False Claims Act and the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (""FIRREA"") for more than 10 years of misconduct in connection with WELLS FARGO's participation in the Federal Housing Administration (""FHA"") Direct Endorsement Lender Program. The lawsuit alleges that, as a result of WELLS FARGO's false certifications, FHA has paid hundreds of millions of dollars in insurance claims on thousands of mortgages that defaulted.
Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said: ""As the complaint alleges, yet another major bank has engaged in a longstanding and reckless trifecta of deficient training, deficient underwriting and deficient disclosure, all while relying on the convenient backstop of government insurance. As also alleged, Wells Fargo's bonus incentive plan - rewarding employees based on the sheer number of loans approved - was an accelerant to a fire already burning, as quality repeatedly took a back seat to quantity. What's more, even after concerns were raised internally at the bank, Wells Fargo began self-reporting bad loans in a significant way, as required, only after this Office issued a subpoena last year. Now a jury will have to weigh the facts to determine the bank's liability and the scope of the damages it must pay.""
HUD General Counsel Helen Kanovsky said: ""Wells Fargo has beena valued participant in the FHA-mortgage lending program. Unfortunately, as alleged in the government's complaint, there was a time when Wells Fargo placed profits over people, corporate results over corporate integrity, and did not consider the effect its actions would have on the FHA program as well as the overall economy. Today's complaint and others like it are necessary, not only to deter future improper acts, but to recover damages on behalf of the FHA mortgage fund and the American taxpayer.""
HUD Inspector General David A. Montoya said: ""As long as these companies fail to exercise ethical corporate responsibility to their customers and their obligations as participants in the Direct Endorsement Lender program administered by FHA, we will endeavor to investigate and hold them accountable. I commend the alliance of efforts between my office and the Departments of Housing and Urban Development and Justice, and especially U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara.""
The following allegations are based on the Complaint filed today in Manhattan Federal court:
WELLS FARGO, the largest originator of home mortgages in the United States, has been a participant in the Direct Endorsement Lender program - a federal program administered by FHA - since 1986. As a Direct Endorsement Lender (""DEL""), WELLS FARGO has the authority to originate, underwrite, and certify mortgages for FHA insurance. If a DEL approves a mortgage loan for FHA insurance and the loan later defaults, the holder of the loan may submit an insurance claim to HUD for the costs associated with the defaulted loan, which HUD must then pay. Under the DEL program, neither the FHA nor HUD reviews a loan before it is endorsed for FHA insurance. DELs are therefore required to follow program rules designed to ensure that they are properly underwriting and certifying mortgages for FHA insurance, and maintaining a quality control program that can prevent and correct any deficiencies in their underwriting. The quality control program requirements include conducting a full review of all loans that go into default within the first six payments (""early payment defaults""); taking prompt and adequate corrective action upon discovery of fraud or serious underwriting problems; and disclosing to HUD, within 60 days of initial discovery, all loans containing evidence of fraud or other serious underwriting problems. WELLS FARGO failed to comply with all three of these basic requirements.
First, between May 2001 and October 2005, WELLS FARGO engaged in a regular practice of reckless origination and underwriting of its retail FHA loans. Nonetheless, WELLS FARGO certified that over 100,000 retail FHA loans met HUD's requirements and therefore were eligible for FHA insurance. During this period, although WELLS FARGO certified to HUD that its retail FHA loans met HUD's requirements for proper origination and underwriting, and were therefore eligible for FHA insurance, the bank knew that a very substantial percentage of those loans - nearly half in certain months - had not been properly underwritten, contained unacceptable risk, did not meet HUD's requirements, and were ineligible for FHA insurance. In fact, WELLS FARGO knew that its underwriters routinely failed to perform basic due diligence, failed to verify information in the loan file that bore directly on the borrower's ability to make payments on the mortgage, and repeatedly certified mortgage loans that contained serious defects and departures from HUD's underwriting standards. The extremely poor quality of WELLS FARGO's loans was a function of management's nearly singular focus on increasing the volume of FHA originations - and the bank's profits - rather than on the quality of the loans being originated.
WELLS FARGO aggravated its widespread underwriting violations by: hiring temporary staff to churn out and approve an ever-increasing quantity of FHA loans; failing to provide its inexperienced staff with proper training; paying improper bonuses to its underwriters to incentivize them to approve as many FHA loans as possible; and applying pressure on loan officers and underwriters to originate and approve more and more FHA loans as quickly as possible. In addition, WELLS FARGO senior management repeatedly ignored its own Quality Assurance department's efforts to have management correct the practices leading to the material violations it found in a significant portion of WELLS FARGO's retail home loans, and failed to report loans to HUD that it knew were rife with serious violations or fraud. By certifying tens of thousands of ineligible mortgages and falsely certifying its compliance with HUD rules, WELLS FARGO wrongfully obtained endorsement of these seriously deficient mortgages for FHA insurance, thereby putting billions of FHA dollars at risk. As a result, HUD has paid hundreds of millions of dollars in FHA benefits on claims for defaulted loans that WELLS FARGO never should have certified for FHA insurance in the first place.
Second, WELLS FARGO failed to conduct adequate quality control and comply with its self-reporting requirements to HUD. In particular, WELLS FARGO failed to report to HUD even a single loan with material underwriting violations or fraud until after a HUD lender review in 2005. When HUD inquired about WELLS FARGO's self-reporting practices in 2005, WELLS FARGO attempted to cover up its misdeeds by falsely suggesting to HUD that the bank actually had been reporting bad loans. And, in a continued effort to avoid indemnification claims from HUD on these bad loans, WELLS FARGO's self-reporting even after HUD's inquiry was woefully and purposefully inadequate. From October 2005 through the time of the subpoena from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York in this investigation, in June 2011, WELLS FARGO reported only about 300 of its seriously deficient loans to HUD.
WELLS FARGO's self-reporting of its loans stands in stark contrast to WELLS FARGO'S findings from its own internal reviews of the quality of its loans. From January 1, 2002 through December 31, 2010, WELLS FARGO internally identified 6,558 seriously deficient loans that it was required to self-report, including 3,142 that had been identified as early payment defaults, or loans which were 60 days into default within the first six months. However, instead of reporting as required, WELLS FARGO concealed 6,320 of these improperly certified loans. WELLS FARGO also failed to conduct reviews of all early payment defaults, as required, and failed to report loans that had been referred to its fraud risk management department (""FRM""), including those loans for which FRM conducted a ""deep dive"" review - reviews which, according to a former WELLS FARGO FRM manager, exposed a ""dirty underbelly of bad loan officers.""
As a result of WELLS FARGO's intentional concealment of the 6,320 loans internally identified as containing material violations, WELLS FARGO avoided indemnification to HUD on approximately $190 million dollars in FHA benefits paid on claims for defaults on those loans. WELLS FARGO additionally avoided indemnification on millions more for the early payment defaults it improperly failed to review and report, and the FRM-identified fraudulent loans it failed to report.
The Complaint seeks treble damages and penalties under the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. §§ 3729 et seq., as well as FIRREA penalties, for hundreds of millions of dollars in insurance claims already paid by HUD for mortgages wrongfully certified by WELLS FARGO. In addition, the United States seeks compensatory damages under the common law theories of breach of fiduciary duty, gross negligence, negligence, unjust enrichment, and payment under mistake of fact, for the hundreds of millions of dollars in insurance claims that HUD has paid, and expects to pay in the future, for mortgages wrongfully certified by WELLS FARGO.
The case is being handled by the Office's Civil Frauds Unit. Mr. Bharara established the Civil Frauds Unit in March 2010 to bring renewed focus and additional resources to combating financial fraud, including mortgage fraud.
To date, the Office's Civil Frauds Unit has brought five civil fraud lawsuits against major lenders under the False Claims Act alleging reckless residential mortgage lending. Three of the five cases have settled. On February 15, 2012, the Government settled its civil fraud lawsuit against CitiMortgage, Inc. for $158.3 million. On February 24, 2012, the Government settled its civil fraud suit against Flagstar Bank, F.S.B. for $132.8 million. On May 10, 2012, the Government settled its civil fraud suit against Deutsche Bank and MortgageIT for $202.3 million. The Government's lawsuit against Allied Home Mortgage Corp. and two of its officers remains pending. In each settlement, the defendants have admitted and accepted responsibility for certain conduct alleged in the Governments' Complaint. The Office's Civil Frauds Unit is handling these cases as part of its continuing investigation of reckless lending practices.
The Civil Frauds Unit works in coordination with President Barack Obama's Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force, on which Mr. Bharara serves as a Co-Chair of the Securities and Commodities Fraud Working Group. President Obama established the interagency Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force to wage an aggressive, coordinated, and proactive effort to investigate and prosecute financial crimes. The task force includes representatives from a broad range of federal agencies, regulatory authorities, inspectors general, and state and local law enforcement who, working together, bring to bear a powerful array of criminal and civil enforcement resources. The task force is working to improve efforts across the federal executive branch, and with state and local partners, to investigate and prosecute significant financial crimes, ensure just and effective punishment for those who perpetrate financial crimes, combat discrimination in the lending and financial markets, and recover proceeds for victims of financial crimes.
Mr. Bharara thanked HUD and HUD-OIG for their extraordinary assistance in this case. He also expressed his appreciation for the support of the Commercial Litigation Branch of the U.S. Department of Justice's Civil Division in Washington, D.C.
Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jeffrey S. Oestericher, Sarah J. North, and Rebecca S. Tinio are in charge of the case."
10/11/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-164.cfm,"HUD Awards Nearly $5 Million to Spur Next Generation of Housing, Neighborhood Transformation","WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Shaun Donovan announced today that 17 communities across the U.S. will receive Choice Neighborhoods Planning Grants. The $4.95 million awarded today provides these communities the resources they need to craft comprehensive, community-driven plans to revitalize public or other HUD-assisted housing and transform distressed neighborhoods. Read more about these local planning efforts.
""While many of these grantees have already collaborated to get to this stage, this funding enables them to take their initial discussions further to plan out strategies to build stronger, more sustainable communities that will address distressed housing, failing schools, rampant crime, and all that plagues the nation's poor neighborhoods,"" said Donovan. ""HUD's Choice Neighborhoods Initiative represents the next generation in a movement toward revitalizing entire neighborhoods to improve the lives of the residents who live there.""
HUD's Choice Neighborhoods Initiative promotes a comprehensive approach to transforming distressed areas of concentrated poverty into viable and sustainable mixed-income neighborhoods. Building on the successes of HUD's HOPE VI Program, Choice Neighborhoods links housing improvements with necessary services for the people who live there - including schools, public transit and employment opportunities.
The awardees announced today were selected from among 72 applications. Successful applicants demonstrated their intent to plan for the transformation of neighborhoods by revitalizing severely distressed public and/or assisted housing while leveraging investments to create high-quality public schools, outstanding education and early learning programs, public assets, public transportation, and improved access to jobs and well-functioning services. HUD focused on directing resources to address three core goals:
Housing: Transform distressed public and assisted housing into energy efficient, mixed-income housing that is physically and financially viable over the long-term; People: Support positive outcomes for families who live in the target development(s) and the surrounding neighborhood, particularly outcomes related to residents' health, safety, employment, mobility, and education; and Neighborhood: Transform neighborhoods of poverty into viable, mixed-income neighborhoods with access to well-functioning services, high quality public schools and education programs, high quality early learning programs and services, public assets, public transportation, and improved access to jobs.
• Housing: Transform distressed public and assisted housing into energy efficient, mixed-income housing that is physically and financially viable over the long-term;
• People: Support positive outcomes for families who live in the target development(s) and the surrounding neighborhood, particularly outcomes related to residents' health, safety, employment, mobility, and education; and
• Neighborhood: Transform neighborhoods of poverty into viable, mixed-income neighborhoods with access to well-functioning services, high quality public schools and education programs, high quality early learning programs and services, public assets, public transportation, and improved access to jobs.
The grantees will use the funding to work with local stakeholders - public and/or assisted housing residents, community members, businesses, institutions and local government officials - to undertake a successful neighborhood transformation to create a ""choice neighborhood."" The awardees will use the funding to create a comprehensive Transformation Plan, or road map, to transforming distressed public and/or assisted housing within a distressed community.
Choice Neighborhoods is one of the signature programs of the White House Neighborhood Revitalization Initiative (www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/oua/initiatives/neighborhood-revitalization), which supports innovative, holistic strategies that bring public and private partners together to help break the cycle of intergenerational poverty. Choice Neighborhoods encourages collaboration between HUD and the Departments of Education, Justice, Treasury and Health and Human Services to support local solutions for sustainable, mixed-income neighborhoods with the affordable housing, safe streets and good schools all families need.
Congress approved the Choice Neighborhoods Initiative with the passage of HUD's FY2010 budget. Funding is provided through two separate programs - Implementation Grants and Planning Grants. With this announcement, HUD has awarded a total of $12.55 million in Planning Grants to 46 cities or counties. See past Planning grantees list here.
Choice Neighborhoods Implementation grants are awarded to entities that have completed a comprehensive local planning process and are ready to move forward with their Transformation Plan to redevelop their target housing and neighborhoods. In August, HUD announced the nine finalists that will compete for approximately $110 million in 2012 Choice Neighborhoods Implementation grants to transform public and other HUD-assisted housing in targeted neighborhoods. Teams recently completed site visits as part of the application review process to determine which of the finalists will receive Implementation grants.
Last year, HUD awarded its first CN Implementation grants for Chicago, Boston, New Orleans, San Francisco and Seattle, a combined $122.27 million investment to bring comprehensive neighborhood revitalization to blighted areas in these cities."

The project is one of 22 award winners to be honored by the National Trust during its 2012 National Preservation Conference next week in Spokane, Washington.
The Award for Excellence in Historic Preservation recognizes efforts that both advance the nation's historic preservation goals and provide affordable housing and economic development opportunities for low- and moderate-income residents. Cleveland's Buckeye-Shaker neighborhood was a thriving, close-knit community in the first half of the 20th century, and at its heart was St. Luke's Hospital. Built in 1927, the 390,000 square-foot complex served the citizens of Cleveland and made major contributions to the city's health-care industry.
However, the neighborhood deteriorated as many of its residents fled to the suburbs in the late 20th century, and Saint Luke's was eventually abandoned. The building remained empty for 12 years, and was repeatedly vandalized over the years as numerous development attempts stalled. Finally, building owners Neighborhood Progress, Inc. found the partner it needed in Pennrose Properties, and together they set out to turn the building into affordable rental housing for seniors and office space for local non-profits. Saint Luke's Manor is now anchoring a 20 acre revitalization effort in the Buckeye-Shaker neighborhood.
Financial support for the project came from the City of Cleveland, the Ohio Housing Finance Agency, the Ohio Department of Development, Enterprise Community Investment, and PNC Bank. The project also utilized both low income and federal and state historic tax credits.
""Thanks to this innovative public-private partnership, Saint Luke's is once again serving as a vital center of community life in Cleveland,"" said Stephanie Meeks, president of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. ""The former hospital, once known for nurturing patients, is now fostering new life in the community.""
""The redevelopment of St. Luke's Hospital speaks volumes about the kind of community we want to live in while preserving where we've come from,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""By respecting the past, the development team is breathing new life into a neighborhood where roots run deep and where the residents continue to aspire to a brighter future.""
The award will be presented to Pennrose Properties, LLC at the Trust's National Preservation Awards ceremony in Spokane, Wash., on Friday, November 2.

11/09/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-170.cfm,Obama Administration Releases October Housing Scorecard,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of the Treasury today released the October edition of the Obama Administration's Housing Scorecard - a comprehensive report on the nation's housing market. Data continue to show signs that the housing market is strengthening - as home price improvements this year have helped lift more than 1.3 million families above water - although officials caution that the overall recovery remains fragile. The full Housing Scorecard is available online at www.hud.gov/scorecard. The Administration is also announcing today that it has provided guidance to servicers participating in the Making Home Affordable Program about options available through the program to homeowners affected by Hurricane Sandy.
""As the October housing scorecard indicates, our housing market is continuing to show important signs of recovery - with the FHFA housing price index posting its largest annual gain in five years and new home sales at its fastest pace since April 2010,"" said HUD Acting Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research Erika Poethig. ""But with so many households still struggling to make ends meet, we have important work ahead. That is why we are asking the Congress to approve the President's refinancing proposal so that more homeowners can receive assistance.""
""Since 2009, the Administration has helped millions of families avoid foreclosure to help our country recover faster from an unprecedented crisis,"" said Treasury Assistant Secretary for Financial Stability Tim Massad. ""To help families in the Northeast recover from the devastation caused by Hurricane Sandy, we are directing servicers to make special efforts to ensure that homeowners eligible for assistance through Making Home Affordable have the extra flexibility and relief they need.""
The October Housing Scorecard features key data on the health of the housing market and the impact of the Administration's foreclosure prevention programs, including:
The Administration's foreclosure programs are providing relief for millions of homeowners as we continue to recover from an unprecedented housing crisis. Nearly 1.3 million homeowner assistance actions have taken place through the Making Home Affordable Program, while the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) has offered more than 1.5 million loss mitigation and early delinquency interventions. The Administration's programs continue to encourage improved standards and processes in the industry, with HOPE Now lenders offering families and individuals more than 3 million proprietary mortgage modifications through August. Homeowners in the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) demonstrate a high likelihood of long-term success to avoid foreclosure. As of September 2012, more than one million families have benefitted from a permanent HAMP modification, saving a median of approximately $541 on their mortgage payments every month. Eighty-six percent of homeowners who started the program in the past two years have received a permanent modification. HAMP modifications continue to perform well over time, exhibiting lower delinquency and re-default rates than private industry modifications as reported by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The generous payment relief offered to many struggling families by HAMP is a strong indicator of their ability to sustain the payments over time.

Earlier this week, Treasury provided guidance to mortgage servicers participating in the Making Home Affordable Program about options available to homeowners affected by Hurricane Sandy. Under program guidelines, servicers must offer a minimum of 3 months forbearance to any Making Home Affordable-eligible homeowner who requests a forbearance and whose property or principal place of business or employment is located in an area designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as being covered by the disaster as set forth at www.fema.gov/news/disasters.fema or as confirmed by the local FEMA office. There are currently more than 60,000 homeowners participating in the Making Home Affordable Program in the New York metropolitan area.
Additionally, if a homeowner is being considered for or has received assistance under the Making Home Affordable Program and misses one or more mortgage payments, Treasury has directed servicers not to take any action that would adversely affect eligibility for the program unless there is contact with the homeowner to establish whether he or she requires forbearance.
Treasury has also encouraged participating servicers to make extra effort to reach out to homeowners who may be eligible for assistance in impacted areas and allow homeowners additional time to respond and provide necessary documentation."
11/16/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-171.cfm,FHA Issues Annual Financial Status Report to Congress,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today released its annual report to Congress on the financial condition of the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) Mutual Mortgage Insurance (MMI) Fund. In reporting on findings of the independent actuarial study, HUD indicates that while FHA continues to be impacted by losses from mortgages originated prior to 2009, this report does not directly affect the adequacy of capital balances in the MMI Fund.
The independent study found that as the housing market continues to recover, the capital reserve ratio of the MMI Fund used to support FHA's single family mortgage and reverse mortgage insurance programs fell below zero to -1.44 percent. This represents a negative economic value of $16.3 billion. This does not mean FHA has insufficient cash to pay insurance claims, a current operating deficit, or will need to immediately draw funds from the Treasury. The need to draw on Treasury funds is determined not by the economic assumptions of this actuarial review but those used in the President's FY 2014 budget proposal to be released in February, with a final determination on a potential draw made in September. Also, the actuary's estimate of the Fund's economic value excludes $11 billion in expected capital accumulation through the end of FY 2013. Finally, HUD's report includes additional actions designed to contribute billions of dollars in added value to the MMI Fund over the next several years.
""FHA has weathered the storm of the recent economic and housing crisis by taking the most aggressive and sweeping actions in its history to reform risk management, credit policy, lender enforcement, and consumer protections,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""During this critical period in our nation's economic history, FHA has provided access to homeownership for millions of American families while helping bring the housing market back from the brink of collapse to a point where the outlook is positive and recovery is underway.""
FHA Acting Commissioner Carol Galante added, ""While the loans made during this Administration remain the strongest in the agency's history, we take the findings of the independent actuary very seriously. We will continue to take aggressive steps to protect FHA's financial health while ensuring that FHA continues to perform its historic role of providing access to homeownership for underserved communities and supporting the housing market during tough economic times.""
Three factors are driving the change in FHA's position compared to last year: First, the house-price appreciation forecasts used for this actuarial review are significantly lower than those used in last year's report, as the actual turnaround in the housing market occurred later than was projected last year. These house-price appreciation estimates do not include improvements to home prices that occurred since June and were depressed by a high level of refinance activity.
Second, the continued decline in interest rates, while good for the overall economy, costs the FHA revenue as its borrowers pay off their mortgages to refinance into lower rates. Again, this is clearly a positive, but it impacts the actuary's estimate of the value of the Fund. In addition, the actuary predicts that borrowers with higher interest rates who are unable to refinance will default at higher than normal rates, increasing losses from foreclosures for FHA.
Third, based on recommendations made by the Government Accountability Office (GAO), HUD's Inspector General and others, FHA directed the actuary to employ a refined methodology this year to more precisely predict the way losses from defaulted loans and reverse mortgages are reflected in the economic value of the MMI Fund.
HUD is announcing a series of changes that are designed to build on previous steps that have improved the health of the Fund. Coupled with the actuary's expectation of $11 billion in additional capital from new business in fiscal 2013, these changes are intended to return FHA's capital reserves to a positive position within the year and also reduce the likelihood that FHA would need to exercise its authority, which all federal loan and loan guarantee programs have, to draw funds from the Treasury in September to cover estimated losses. To do this, FHA will:
Continue to sell expanded pools of defaulted mortgages headed for foreclosure through the Distressed Asset Stabilization Program (DASP), offering investors and borrowers the opportunity to avoid costly foreclosures - and even giving homeowners an additional chance at staying in their homes – while reducing costs to the Fund. The FHA is committing to sell at least 10,000 distressed loans per quarter over the next year; Revise its loss mitigation program to target deeper levels of payment relief for struggling borrowers, allowing more families to retain their homes and avoid foreclosure, reducing associated losses to FHA; Expand the use of short-sales, which will provide opportunities for distressed borrowers who have been unable to get out from under hundreds of thousands of dollars of mortgage debt to move to a new job or start anew while improving recoveries for FHA. Foreclosures are expensive, for families and the Fund. By reducing the likelihood that a family will be foreclosed upon, we reduce costs for the Fund; Continue to streamline policies to increase efficiency and decrease losses associated with the sale of foreclosed properties; Reverse a policy made in a prior Administration to cancel required premium payments after a certain periodthat effectively meant that while FHA's 100% insurance guarantee remained in effect for the 30-year life of a loan, borrowers were only required to pay premiums for less than ten years. FHA has been left without premiums to cover losses on loans held beyond the period for which it collects premiums. This change will apply to new loans. In 2013, enact an increase of 10 basis points or 0.1 percent to the annual insurance premium paid by borrowers on new FHA loans. This premium increase is expect to add $13 per month for the average borrower and will strengthen FHA's capital position without limiting access to credit for qualified borrowers.

This premium increase is expect to add $13 per month for the average borrower and will strengthen FHA's capital position without limiting access to credit for qualified borrowers.
Losses on loans insured between Fiscal Years 2007 and 2009 continue to place a significant strain on the Fund with $70 billion in FHA claims attributable to loans insured in those years. Though they were prohibited in 2009, the ongoing effect of ""seller-funded downpayment assistance loans"" is still significant. The net expected cost of those loans, as projected by the independent actuaries, is more than $15 billion. By contrast, the actuary found that the FHA's books of business since FY2010 are expected to be very beneficial, providing billions of dollars in net revenues to offset losses on earlier books. Under the base-case projection of the independent actuary, FHA's FY2013 book should add an additional $11 billion in economic value to the Fund.
Since taking office in 2009, the Obama Administration has instituted sweeping reforms to strengthen the MMI Fund. New policies have improved loan quality, strengthened lender enforcement, and improved premium revenues. This has been the most comprehensive update to FHA credit policies, risk management, lender monitoring, and consumer protections in its history, adding more than $20 billion in value to the Fund.
Over the past year, FHA has been:

11/19/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-172.cfm,"Bipartisan National Mortgage Settlement Provides Support to Nearly 310,000 Homeowners","WASHINGTON - The nation's largest mortgage servicers have distributed $26.1 billion in direct relief to nearly 310,000 homeowners, or roughly $84,385 per homeowner as part of the National Mortgage Settlement, according to a progress report released today by independent settlement monitor Joseph A. Smith of the Office of Mortgage Settlement Oversight. Earlier this year, the Department of Justice, Department of Housing Urban Development (HUD) and 49 state attorneys general reached a landmark agreement with the nation's five largest mortgage servicers to address mortgage loan servicing and foreclosure abuses.
""At a moment when Americans have been looking for Washington to put partisanship aside to deliver results, Monitor Smith's report indicates that families and struggling homeowners can get what they are promised when we work together,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan.
The report demonstrates significant progress on the broadest and most robust principal reduction program in the nation's history. More than $19.4 billion of the overall completed consumer relief has come in the form of debt forgiveness. Because of the settlement, banks have provided over $10.5 billion in principal reduction that helps borrowers stay in their homes, lowering monthly payments on over 118,000 loans and actually reducing struggling homeowners' loan balances by more than $88,000 on average.
In addition, to date, States have allocated more than $1 billion of state settlement funds for housing-related purposes, including nearly $250 million to housing counseling and another $50 million to legal aid.
Adding to the benefits for consumers, as of October the five largest mortgage servicers—representing 60 percent of the mortgage market—were required to comply with tough customer service standards that are designed to put an end to the lost paperwork, dropped calls and runaround that harmed so many families.
""With servicers on track to fulfill much of their consumer relief commitments in the first year of this agreement, homeowners are finally beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel,"" said Donovan. ""That's encouraging news - for families, for neighborhoods, for our housing market and for the country.""

11/20/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-174.cfm,Court Approves Final Settlement Thompson v. HUD,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. District Court of Maryland today granted final approval of a settlement of the 17-year-old civil rights case known as Thompson v. HUD, filed by African American public housing residents against the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the Housing Authority of Baltimore City (HABC), and the City of Baltimore.
""HUD is pleased that the parties have resolved this longstanding civil rights case in such a positive and productive manner,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""We know that when a family chooses a place to live, they are not just choosing a home, but also a school for their children, quality public services, and a foundation on which to build their lives. By building on the successful Baltimore housing mobility program, today's settlement goes a long way to achieving these goals and furthering HUD's mission of creating more inclusive and sustainable communities that provide affordable housing opportunities for those who need them.""
""Today's final settlement draws to a close a lengthy dispute and does so in a way that will make a real difference to thousands of families in Baltimore,"" said Tony West, Acting Associate Attorney General. ""Through this multi-faceted resolution, the settlement agreement provides that HUD will continue to work to ensure that more affordable housing opportunities exist and that families will be assisted through the process of finding them, so that they can more easily move forward with their lives.""
Stuart Delery, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the Department of Justice's Civil Division explained that ""This resolution helps move past litigation toward a process that seeks to significantly improve opportunities for public housing residents to obtain quality, affordable housing in the Baltimore area.""
The Thompson case was originally filed in 1995 by African-American families who are current and former residents of Baltimore City public housing. The plaintiff class charged that the HABC and HUD created and continued a racially segregated system of public housing in Baltimore City that violated the U.S. Constitution, the Fair Housing Act, and other civil rights laws.
Certain parts of the case related to the demolition and redevelopment of several Baltimore City high rise public housing projects previously were settled through a partial consent decree that was approved by the U.S. District Court in 1996. The prior consent decree had at its core the Baltimore housing mobility program, on which this settlement also is based.
HUD General Counsel Helen Kanovsky commented, ""Over the past decade, the housing mobility program, established as part of the earlier partial settlement in Thompson, has provided more than 1800 families greater neighborhood choice, enabling them to move from high poverty areas of Baltimore to mixed-income neighborhoods in the city and surrounding region that offer better educational and employment opportunities. Today's final settlement will allow for similar opportunities for up to 2600 additional families over the next seven years.""
Key elements of the final settlement approved today include:
Regional Housing Opportunities. HUD will continue the successful mobility program launched in an earlier phase of the Thompson case. Over the past decade, this program has provided Housing Choice Vouchers and high-quality housing counseling to assist more than 1,800 families who have voluntarily chosen to move from public housing and other areas of deep poverty in Baltimore City to neighborhoods throughout Baltimore City and the surrounding region that are low in poverty and offer better educational and economic opportunities. The settlement will provide similar opportunities for up to 2600 additional families, through 2018. Incentives for Affordable Housing Development. HUD will seek to provide incentives for private housing developers to include affordable units for families when FHA insured market-rate developments are built in communities of opportunity throughout the Baltimore region. On-line Housing Locator. HUD will develop an online listing to provide assistance to families in locating public housing and other affordable housing opportunities throughout the Baltimore Region. Regional Opportunity Study. HUD will sponsor a study of housing opportunity throughout Baltimore City and the surrounding region. Civil Rights Reviews. For a period of at least three years, HUD will conduct civil rights reviews of particular plans and other proposals submitted to HUD for approval, involving certain federally funded housing and community development programs in the Baltimore Region. In these reviews, HUD will pay particular attention to the impact of the plans and other proposals, individually and collectively, on the creation of a broader geographic distribution of available desegregative housing.

11/20/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-176.cfm,FHA Announces Revised Loss Mitigation Home Retention Options,"WASHINGTON - The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) announced changes on Friday to its loss mitigation program which are intended to allow more borrowers to take advantage of opportunities that enable them to keep their homes. Through revisions made to FHA's Loss Mitigation Home Retention Options, a greater number of distressed borrowers will be able to qualify for FHA loss mitigation interventions, and the level of assistance available to them will be larger than under previous guidelines. These changes will not only assist families in keeping their homes, but will also reduce the number of full claims against the FHA Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund.
""FHA's Loss Mitigation Program has long been an industry leader in helping to ensure that distressed borrowers are afforded maximum opportunities to retain their homes,"" said Acting FHA Commissioner Carol Galante. ""Not only are we taking steps to make sure more borrowers can benefit from FHA loss mitigation assistance, but we are also targeting our assistance to provide more sustainable payments for borrowers so that they are successful in retaining their homes over the long term. At the same time, these efforts will reduce losses to FHA from foreclosures, benefiting our insurance fund.""
Included among the changes being announced to FHA's existing Loss Mitigation options are the following:
Streamlining FHA's Loss Mitigation Home Retention Option priority order to a new 3-tier incentive structure, consisting of Special Forbearance, Loan Modification, and FHA-HAMP; Special Forbearance is a written agreement between a lender and borrower to reduce and/or suspend mortgage payments. Loan Modification is a permanent change to one or more of the terms of a mortgage loan. FHA-HAMP typically involves the combination of a Loan Modification and a Partial Claim where the lender will advance funds on behalf of the borrower in an amount necessary to reinstate the delinquent loan. Redefining ""Special Forbearance"" to apply only in cases where the mortgagors are unemployed; Eliminating some requirements which limited lenders' ability to provide the assistance borrowers needed; And expanding the FHA-HAMP program so that greater numbers of borrowers find sustainable long term assistance through FHA-HAMP modifications.

11/28/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-182.cfm,HUD Announces Deal to Refinance Mortgage Loan for New York City Cooperative,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Shaun Donovan today announced a $621 million deal to refinance a previous mortgage at Co-op City, a large cooperative housing community that is home to more than 57,000 residents in the Bronx, New York. Today, HUD and Wells Fargo Bank N.A. closed on the loan that will preserve long-term affordable housing for these families and significantly lower annual interest payments for the building's owner over the next 35 years. The new mortgage is backed by the Federal Housing Administration's (FHA) General Insurance and Special Risk Insurance (GI/SRI) Fund.
By guaranteeing the mortgage, FHA's Section 223(f) Program allows this 35-year loan to be financed with Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) Mortgage-Backed Securities. This eligibility for purchase in the secondary mortgage market improves the availability of loan funds and permits more favorable interest rates. As a consequence, FHA and GNMA's security is helping Riverbay Corporation, the owner of Co-Op City, to save an estimated $400 million in interest payments over the life of the mortgage.
""This is about preserving affordable housing for the next generation of families living and working in one of the nation's highest cost rental markets,"" said Donovan. ""Working closely with the State of New York and New York City, we're making certain that working families have a decent and affordable place to call home while saving private owners of affordable housing significant money that they can reinvest back into their properties.""
Located in the Baychester section of the Bronx, Co-op City is situated on 330 acres located along the west bank of the Hutchinson River. In addition to 15,372 units in 35 residential structures, the site includes three shopping centers, a 25-acre educational park, eight parking garages, three elementary schools, two middle schools, a high school, a weather station, 14 gymnasiums, two swimming pools, 15 churches, six nursery schools and day care centers, four basketball courts, five baseball diamonds, numerous restaurants, a power plant and a multiplex movie theater.
The cooperative is organized under the State of New York's Mitchell Lama Program which was designed to provide affordable housing to the State's low- and middle- income residents through low-interest loans and real estate tax exemptions. Co-op City will remain in the Mitchell Lama program for the 35-year term of the FHA-insured loan and will continue to provide affordable housing to its residents.
The State of New York Mortgage Agency (SONYMA) will provide mortgage insurance and New York City Housing Development Corporation (HDC) will provide a Guaranty for the first $70 million or 11.25 percent of the loan ($55 million and $15 million coverage of the loan, respectively). This risk-sharing arrangement reduces FHA's risk and makes mortgage financing even more affordable for the cooperative's owner.
Since 2004, over $310 million in renovations have been completed at Co-op City. This FHA-insured loan will be used to refinance the existing mortgage and provide capital for an additional $26 million in repairs. A portion of these repairs were made possible by J-51 tax abatements, which are administered by the City of New York."
11/28/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-183.cfm,"HUD Charges Owner, Architect, Builder and Designers of Missouri Condominium Complex with Discriminating Against Persons with Disabilities","KANSAS CITY, KS - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has charged the owner, architect, builder and designers of Valle Creek Condominiums in Pevely, Missouri with violating the Fair Housing Act by failing to design and construct the units so that they are accessible to persons with disabilities.
According to HUD's charge, the complex is inaccessible because, among other things, steps and inaccessible curb ramps prevent persons using wheelchairs from getting to the units, the clubhouse and many of the common areas.
The Fair Housing Act requires that multifamily housing structures built for first occupancy after March 13, 1991, contain accessible features for persons with disabilities. The requirements include accessible common areas, bathrooms and kitchens, as well as wider doors and environmental controls that can be reached by persons who use wheelchairs. The failure to include these features violates the Fair Housing Act.
""Wheelchair users can never feel at home if their housing has obstacles that the Fair Housing Act intended to eliminate almost 25 years ago,"" said Betty Bottiger, HUD's Region VII Director for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD is committed to enforcing the nation's fair housing laws and creating greater housing opportunities for persons with disabilities.""
Terri Porter, Deputy Regional Director, added: ""Everyone involved in the design and construction of new multifamily dwellings needs to be aware of their responsibility under the Fair Housing Act and do all they can to build housing that meets the law's requirements.""
The complex came to HUD's attention after Metropolitan St. Louis Equal Housing Council (EHOC), a non-profit fair housing advocacy organization, filed a complaint claiming that EHOC testers had found numerous violations of the Fair Housing Act's design and construction requirements. HUD's charge alleges numerous inaccessible aspects of the complex, including narrow kitchens that make it difficult to use a wheelchair, thermostats that are too high to be reached by persons using wheelchairs, knob-style hardware on the front doors, and mailboxes that cannot be accessed by persons using wheelchairs.
A United States Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) will hear HUD's charge. If the ALJ finds after an administrative hearing that discrimination has occurred, the ALJ may award damages to the complainant. In addition, the ALJ may impose fines to vindicate the public interest, order injunctive and other equitable relief to deter further discrimination, and require payment of attorney fees.
HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity and its partners in the Fair Housing Assistance Program investigate approximately 10,000 housing discrimination complaints annually.
People who believe they have experienced or witnessed unlawful housing discrimination should contact HUD at (800) 669-9777 (voice), or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). More information about fair housing rights is available at HUD's website, www.hud.gov/fairhousing."
11/29/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-175.cfm,FHA Issues Guidance to Help FHA-Insured Families in Disaster Areas,"WASHINGTON - The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) recently published guidance to help families with FHA-insured mortgages struggling to repair or rebuild their homes in the wake of major disasters like Hurricane Sandy. FHA's mortgagee letter reinforces the agency's longstanding policy of extending foreclosure relief and directs lenders to release insurance proceeds to borrowers rather than to apply those payouts to bring delinquent mortgages current.
FHA is also providing consumer-friendly advice to homeowners with FHA-insured mortgages whose homes were damaged or destroyed. Read more about disaster relief options for FHA homeowners on HUD's website.
""These guidelines provide clarity to the lending community and ultimately help families with FHA-insured mortgages to recover from major disasters,"" said Acting FHA Commissioner Carol Galante. ""Whether it's giving delinquent borrowers more time to get back on their feet or making sure lenders don't misuse insurance payouts, our goal is to make sure we put these families on the path to recovery as quickly as possible.""
FHA's guidance:
Outlines the 90-day moratorium of foreclosures on properties located in the Presidentially-declared disaster areas; Asks servicers to consider a full range of benefits for the affected borrowers. This includes mortgage modifications, partial claims, use of FHA HAMP or other refinance options; and a waiver of late charges; Directs lenders to release homeowners' insurance proceeds to the borrower rather than retaining such proceeds to make up for missed payments; and Summarizes HUD's special Section 203(h) mortgage insurance product to assist disaster victims and references HUD's Section 203(k) Rehabilitation Mortgage Insurance Product.

11/29/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-185.cfm,Office of Sustainable Housing and Communities Accomplishments Report Demonstrates How Sustainability Grants are Helping Plan for Stronger Regional Economies,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Office of Sustainable Housing and Communities (OSHC) today released its 2012 Accomplishments Report, Helping Communities Realize a More Prosperous Future, which highlights how grantees of the 2010 and 2011 HUD Sustainability Grants are working to support locally led collaborative efforts that are building stronger regional economies.
""Regions that embrace sustainable development by making connections between housing and jobs have a built-in competitive edge in attracting employers and private investment. We are beginning to see this in the grantee communities and regions helped by our grants,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""Our nation's ability to compete in a global economy is dependent upon how quickly and efficiently we can connect workers and families to education and employment opportunities.""
Among the most significant findings of the report is the almost 100 percent leveraging of federal funds. In 2010 and 2011 OSHC awarded 152 grants in 48 states, totaling $240 million. This in turn has generated almost $253 million in private investments and commitments from local partners. The report further highlights that HUD's Sustainable Communities grantees have brought significant local, state and private resources to the table. HUD's investment of $95.8 million in 2011 generated $115 million in matching and in-kind contributions - which is more than 120% of the Federal investment - from the 56 selected grantees.
HUD estimates that its two years of grant funding will have a positive impact on 133 million Americans by helping their communities and regions become more efficient and competitive while improving their quality of life.
The report alsoprovides numerous examples of grantees in small and large communities who are utilizing sustainability principles to create jobs. In Memphis, TN, for example, The Aerotropolis Initiative, an integrated housing, transportation and economic development strategy is stimulating investment in the vicinity of the Memphis International Airport. In coordination with other regional logistics and infrastructure strategies, the Initiative, developed in concert with FedEx, Elvis Presley's Graceland, Medtronic and Smith Nephew biodevice companies, and numerous other major U. S. employers will lead to the creation of more than 3,000 local jobs and produce tens of millions in private capital investment.
""The planning efforts underway are bringing together the community and economic development strategies to transform the adjoining area that can be attributed with nearly half of our metro areas gross metro product. This could not have been accomplished without the HUD grant and the federal partnership for sustainable communities,"" said Dexter Muller, Senior Vice President at the Greater Memphis Chamber of Commerce.
""When 52 cents of every dollar of a working family's income is devoted to housing and transportation costs alone, we know this is a problem that affects a family's ability to save and contribute to the local economy,"" said Shelley Poticha, Director of HUD's OSHC. ""Our efforts are critical to alleviating that burden on working families, and to supporting locally led planning efforts. These bring together a diverse set of stakeholders to determine how to best plan for economic and workforce development, housing and transportation.""
OSHC is part of the Partnership for Sustainable Communities, which is a partnership between HUD, the U.S. Department of Transportation, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. It's goal is to support local and regional economic development, energy conservation, and increased transportation and housing options.

11/29/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-186.cfm,HUD Charges Minnesota Condominium Association and Property Managers with Discriminating Against Families with Children,"CHICAGO - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is charging the homeowner association and property managers for an Edina, MN, condominium building with housing discrimination. HUD claims that they refused to allow children under the age of 18 to live at the property.
According to HUD's charge, 7000 Sandell Condominium Association, Inc., its property management company, New Concepts Management Group, Inc., and the property's off-site manager, Paul L. Bonzonie, violated the Fair Housing Act when they maintained a policy prohibiting children who are minors from living in the building, even though the property did not meet the federal qualifications to be housing for older persons.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers, including condominium associations, from denying housing to families with children under the age of 18, unless the housing meets the federal standards to be housing for older persons.
""Denying a family's right to have their children live in their home is against the law,"" said HUD's Region V Administrator Antonio R. Riley. ""HUD is committed to taking action against housing providers who unlawfully deny housing to families because they have children.""
HUD's charge alleges that the condominium association and its property managers discriminated against the owners of a unit in the building when they notified the owners that they were violating the association's Declaration for Condominium by allowing their minor children to live with them for more than 30 days in a calendar year, levied fines against the owners, and initiated a lawsuit in Minnesota state court in an effort to keep the owners' children from living with them. HUD's charge further alleges that the condominium association failed to meet the federal requirements to qualify as housing for older persons because the association failed to formally and routinely verify the ages of the complex's residents.
A United States Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) will hear HUD's charge. If the ALJ finds after an administrative hearing that discrimination has occurred, the ALJ may award damages to the complainants. In addition, the ALJ may impose fines to vindicate the public interest, order injunctive and other equitable relief to deter further discrimination, and require payment of attorney fees.
FHEO and its partners in the Fair Housing Assistance Program investigate approximately 10,000 housing discrimination complaints annually. People who believe they are victims of housing discrimination should contact HUD at 1-800-669-9777 (voice)."
12/03/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-184.cfm,HUD Secretary Announces Foreclosure Protection for Displaced New Hampshire Storm Victims,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan today announced HUD will speed federal disaster assistance to the State of New Hampshire in addition to resources being provided by FEMA and other federal partners. HUD will provide support to homeowners and low-income renters forced from their homes due to Hurricane Sandy.
Last week, President Obama issued a disaster declaration for Belknap, Carroll, Coos, Grafton, and Sullivan counties. The President's declaration allows HUD to offer foreclosure relief and other assistance to certain families living in these counties.
""Families who may have been forced from their homes need to know that help is available to begin the rebuilding process,"" said Donovan. ""Whether it's foreclosure relief for families with FHA-insured loans or helping these counties to recover, HUD stands ready to help in any way we can.""

12/03/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-187.cfm,HUD Announces Preliminary Results of Note Sales Under Expanded Distressed Asset Stabilization Program,"WASHINGTON - As part of a broad based effort to address the housing market's ""shadow inventory"" and to target relief to communities experiencing high foreclosure activity, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced preliminary results from the first loan sale under its expanded Distressed Asset Stabilization Program (DASP). HUD's next scheduled sale, which will take place late in the first quarter of 2013, will include approximately 10,000-15,000 loans, and will have targeted Neighborhood Stabilization Outcome (NSO) pools located in select metropolitan areas in Georgia, California, Florida, and Ohio.
HUD is accelerating the use of loan sales through DASP, selling severely delinquent mortgage loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) through a competitive bidding process in which loan pools are sold to the highest bidder, including non-profit and community-based organizations.
""This program accomplishes two very important objectives - it supports communities hardest hit by the housing crisis and it saves considerable money for FHA's insurance fund,"" said FHA's Acting Commissioner Carol Galante. ""The results from the September sales were strong which tells us investors of all stripes and communities are eager for this solution.""
HUD will sell at least 40,000 distressed loans over the next year, generally in quarterly sales, in an effort to reduce total claims cost and increase recovery on losses to FHA's Mutual Mortgage Insurance (MMI) Fund. The results from the September sale were strong with a record participation among interested bidders. While FHA is in the process of settling the transactions, making the results announced today still preliminary, it is very pleased with the bid prices received in the September sale. The results of which, when considered by FHA's independent actuary, yielded an estimate of an additional $1 billion in economic value to FHA's Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund in fiscal year 2013 alone by significantly reducing the expected severity of losses on loans sold through the program. See results from September's note sales on HUD's website.
HUD's September sale took place in two parts. The first part, conducted on September 12th, consisted of approximately 5,300 non-performing loans in six different ""national"" pools with a combined unpaid principal balance of $950 million. The second part occurred on September 27th and consisted of approximately 4,100 loans in seven different ""Neighborhood Stabilization Outcome (NSO)"" pools with a total of approximately $770 million in unpaid principal balance. The NSO pools are a new and important addition to DASP. They consist of loans pooled in geographically concentrated areas and are accompanied by sale terms that promote neighborhood stability in hard-hit communities. NSO pools in the September sale were in four geographic areas: Chicago, Illinois; Tampa, Florida; Phoenix, Arizona; and Newark, New Jersey.
FHA worked closely with the state and local government on their neighborhood stabilization objectives to carve out targeted sub-pools in three of the geographic areas that were eligible for and won by non-profit, community-based organizations.
A record number of bids were received on all 13 pools and each pool was awarded to the highest bidder. In total, the 13 pools went to 10 different entities. The three targeted NSO sub-pools were all awarded to nonprofit and community-based organizations. One of these organizations partnered with the State of Illinois using the U.S. Treasury's Hardest Hit Fund to facilitate the transaction. For more information about successful bidders, visit HUD's Asset Sales Office website.
HUD's Upcoming Note Sale in Late First Quarter of 2013
Like September's sale, the first sale in 2013, which be held late in the first quarter, will be held in two parts. In the first part HUD will accept competitive bids for non-performing loans bundled into national pools. In the second part, to be held roughly two weeks after, loans will be offered in NSO pools in geographically concentrated areas including the following metropolitan areas: Atlanta; Southern California (Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino and Long Beach); Ohio (Cleveland, Akron and Canton); and Florida (Fort Lauderdale, Miami and Greater Orlando). More information regarding the upcoming sale will be available in the coming weeks and can be found on HUD's Asset Sales Office website.
Distressed Asset Stabilization Program
FHA's note sales program was resumed in 2010 as a direct sale pilot program that allows pools of mortgages headed for foreclosure to be sold to qualified bidders and charges them with helping to bring the loan out of default. In many cases, this is a less expensive alternative to foreclosure and sale as REO. An FHA servicer can place a loan into the loan pool if the following criteria are met:
The borrower is at least six months delinquent on their mortgage; The servicer has exhausted all steps in the FHA loss mitigation process; and The servicer has initiated foreclosure proceedings;
• The borrower is at least six months delinquent on their mortgage;
• The servicer has exhausted all steps in the FHA loss mitigation process; and
• The servicer has initiated foreclosure proceedings;
Under the program, FHA-insured loans are sold competitively at a market-determined price generally below the outstanding principal balance. Once the loan is purchased, foreclosure is delayed for a minimum of six additional months, during which time the new servicer can work with the borrower to find an affordable solution to avoid foreclosure. These loans are purchased at market rate, which is generally well below the outstanding principal balance, giving the investor the incentive to take additional steps to help the borrower avoid foreclosure, including modifications that may include reduced principal balances.
Last June, as part of an effort to address its seriously delinquent loan portfolio, FHA announced that, over the next several years, it would significantly increase the number of loans it makes available for purchase as well as add a new neighborhood stabilization pool to encourage investment in communities hardest hit by the foreclosure crisis. The ""Neighborhood Stabilization Outcome"" (NSO) pools, as an additional safeguard in distressed communities, require that no more than 50 percent of the loans within a purchased pool be marketed as real-estate owned (REO) properties and - if the servicer and borrower are unable to avoid taking the loan through foreclosure - that the servicer achieve some other neighborhood stabilizing outcome, which may include holding the property for rental for at least three years."
12/04/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-177.cfm,HUD Gives Housing Agencies Added Flexibility to Help Families Find Rental Housing Following Hurricane Sandy,"WASHINGTON - To expand housing options for families displaced by Hurricane Sandy, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced that it is giving public housing agencies greater flexibility in calculating rent payments in areas experiencing increased demand for rental housing. This is one of several actions HUD is taking to cut red tape to help families who were forced from their homes and require alternative housing.
HUD is allowing local housing agencies to increase a payment standard up to 120 percent of the published ""Fair Market Rent"" thereby giving low-income families more options to find available housing in tight rental markets. Read HUD's notice.
""We understand that in the wake of a disaster like Sandy, available rental housing becomes increasingly difficult to find, especially for lower income families,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan, who President Obama recently appointed to oversee long-term disaster redevelopment in the disaster region. ""Simply by giving local housing authorities greater flexibility in calculating rental assistance to these families can make all the difference in finding a suitable home or not. This is just one more example of how the Obama Administration is cutting red tape to make our programs work better following a disaster.""
Local housing agencies use HUD's annual Fair Market Rents (FMR) to determine how much rental subsidy low-income families are eligible for through HUD's Housing Choice Voucher Program. Currently housing agencies are allowed to set this payment standard up to 110 percent of an area's FMR. However, in Presidentially Declared Disaster Areas, housing agencies can request a waiver to temporarily establish a payment standard up to 120 percent of the current FMR.
For example, the FMR for a 2-bedroom unit in Union County, N.J. is $1,202. Housing of this size in the area could rent for more or less than that amount, but under HUD's Housing Choice Voucher program the local housing authority can set a payment standard anywhere from 90 to 110 percent of the FMR. At the 110 percent payment standard, the maximum monthly rental assistance would be $1,322. However, under this special waiver of HUD regulatory requirements, housing agencies can increase the payment standard to 120 percent, which in this example, would mean the maximum monthly subsidy could increase to $1,442.
Families would continue to pay their required portion of the rent, typically 30 percent of adjusted monthly income, but because of the increase in the maximum subsidy available, the measure would allow displaced families to afford housing they would not normally be able to under the regular payment standard, thereby increasing the available supply of housing that these families could afford. The measure also prevents the displacement of HUD-assisted families where rents may be increasing significantly as the result of the loss of rental housing stock in the disaster areas.
HUD and other federal agencies are helping displaced families find alternative housing while their homes are repaired. The Federal Emergency Management's Housing Portal (http://asd.fema.gov/inter/hportal/home.htm) consolidates rental resources from HUD, Department of Agriculture, Department of Veterans Affairs, private organizations, and the public to help families and individuals locate rental units in their area. HUD is also cutting red tape to help accelerate the re-housing of these families, including:
Allowing senior housing providers the flexibility to open up vacant units to evacuees of Hurricane Sandy under the age of 55 without jeopardizing a community's qualification for certain legal exemptions under the Fair Housing Act. Read HUD's open letter. Relaxing federal regulations for dozens of 'participating jurisdictions' in Hurricane Sandy-impacted areas so they can quickly rehabilitate single-family housing and to use vacant rental units to quickly house displaced families. Read HUD's waivers under the HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME).

12/04/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-188.cfm,"HUD, Houston Housing Authority Settle Discrimination Complaint Involving Deaf Resident","FORT WORTH - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has reached an agreement with the Houston Housing Authority. The agreement settles allegations that the housing authority initially refused a Deaf resident's requests to have a sign language interpreter present at a hearing to determine her eligibility to remain in HUD's Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program.
The resident alleged that when the housing authority refused to provide an interpreter, she was forced to use her daughter, who is a minor and is not fluent in American Sign Language, to interpret for her. Additionally, the resident alleged that the housing authority's refusal to provide an interpreter caused her to lose her HCV program eligibility.
Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 states that no otherwise qualified individual with disabilities shall be discriminated against under any program or activity receiving federal funds. In addition, the Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from discriminating against persons with disabilities.
""Everyone should be able to understand their housing rights and options,"" said Mark Brezina, HUD's Acting Region VI Administrator. ""For a Deaf person receiving HUD rental assistance, a Public Housing Authority may need to provide an interpreter to convey information, particularly when a person's continued tenancy is at stake.""
In her complaint, the resident alleged that she twice asked the housing authority to provide a translator for the hearing, but none was provided, and that the complex nature of her HCV eligibility hearing prevented her daughter from effectively interpreting for her. The outcome of the hearing was that the resident's housing assistance was terminated. After the resident filed a complaint with HUD, the housing authority held a second hearing, during which an interpreter was provided. Following the second hearing, the resident's housing assistance was reinstated.
Under the agreement, the Houston Housing Authority paid $4,251 in rental assistance payments that were owed to the resident's landlord for the period her rental assistance was terminated. The housing authority also notified its employees of its intent to provide sign language interpreters for individuals who are Deaf or hard of hearing, agreed to inform new HCV program participants of their right to request reasonable accommodations, including interpreters, and agreed not to retaliate against the resident or her children in any way.
Anyone who believes that a housing provider has discriminated against him or her because of a disability should contact HUD at (800) 669-9777 (voice), 800-927-9275 (TTY)."
12/07/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-189.cfm,HUD Launches Improved On-Line Tool to Facilitate Consultation with Indian Tribes About Federally Funded Development,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today unveiled a new and improved online data tool to help HUD, state and local planning agencies, and others more clearly identify federally recognized Indian tribes, Native Hawaiian organizations, and Alaska Natives so they can consult with them on development projects in places that have tribal historic, environmental and cultural significance.
HUD's announcement comes as the White House this week hosted the 2012 Tribal Nations Conference, a gathering of representatives from hundreds of federally recognized American Indian tribes, and Alaska Native Villages.
HUD's Tribal Directory Assessment Tool (TDAT) (http://egis.hud.gov/tdat/Tribal.aspx) is an online database that contains information about federally recognized Indian tribes and their geographic areas of current and ancestral interest down to the county level. It lists names and contact information for tribal leaders and Tribal Historic Preservation Officers (THPOs) allowing users to query by street address, county, state, and tribe. Information generated from TDAT can be exported in spreadsheet format for use in other programs.
""This tool is a vast improvement in how we approach federally funded development to ensure the full participation of tribal communities,"" said Mark Johnston, HUD's Acting Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development. ""With just a few clicks, planners will literally be building a bridge to those stakeholders with a deep, even spiritual interest in how these lands are developed.""
TDAT 2.0 was developed by HUD's Office Community Planning and Development (CPD). TDAT 2.0 improves upon an earlier version developed in 2008 by offering lists of tribal interest by street address and county, and by including an export to Excel function.
Federally funded development projects undergo an extensive environmental review to ensure compliance with a wide range of federal standards and regulations. This includes a review of potential impacts to historic and archeological resources commonly known as the Section 106 review process, named after the relevant section of the National Historic Preservation Act. This section of the Act requires consultation about historic properties of religious and cultural significance to tribal communities. It further requires HUD and/or other 'responsible entities' to make a reasonable and good faith effort to identify federally recognized Indian tribes, Native Hawaiian organizations, and Alaska Natives and to consult with them on projects that may impact historic properties of significance to them.
TDAT 2.0 can quickly identify which tribes have an interest in a project area and provide tribal contact information to use in initiating Section 106 consultations. Additional information about Section 106 and tribal consultation is available on HUD's website."
12/07/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-192.cfm,Obama Administration Releases November Housing Scorecard,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of the Treasury today released the November edition of the Obama Administration's Housing Scorecard - a comprehensive report on the nation's housing market. Data continue to show signs that the housing market is strengthening - as home values continue to rise and home sales remained strong in October. The full Housing Scorecard is available online at www.hud.gov/scorecard.
""The Obama Administration's efforts to speed housing recovery are showing continued progress as the scorecard indicators highlight market momentum not seen since before the housing crisis - six consecutive months of rising home prices have bolstered homeowners equity, which is now $1.5 trillion higher than in April 2009,"" said HUD Acting Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research Erika Poethig. ""But with so many households still struggling to make ends meet, we have important work ahead. That is why we are asking Congress to approve the President's refinancing proposal so that more homeowners can receive assistance.""
Included in this month's Making Home Affordable Program Report (www.treasury.gov/initiatives/financial-stability/reports/Pages/Making-Home-Affordable-Program-Performance-Report.aspx) are detailed assessments from the third quarter of 2012for the largest mortgage servicers participating in the program with results. The Servicer Assessments - first introduced in June 2011 and published quarterly - have set a new standard for disclosure around servicer efforts to assist struggling homeowners.
""The Administration remains focused on continuing to improve standards for the mortgage industry to help families avoid foreclosure,"" said Treasury Assistant Secretary for Financial Stability Tim Massad. ""We continue to push the industry to provide better service to homeowners while expanding the range of solutions available to families facing mortgage concerns.""
Since the inception of the Making Home Affordable Program, Treasury has required participating servicers to take specific actions to improve their processes through ongoing program reviews. The quarterly Servicer Assessments summarize performance on metrics in three categories of program implementation: identifying and contacting homeowners; homeowner evaluation and assistance; and program reporting, management and governance. Results for the third quarter of 2012 show that servicers are focusing attention on areas identified in previous program reviews and, as a result, are demonstrating continued improvement in program implementation:
Servicers are more effectively evaluating homeowners under program eligibility criteria as seen in the ""second look disagree"" category, which reflects the rate at which Treasury's program reviews disagree with the servicers' decision to find a homeowner ineligible for assistance. In the third quarter, the average second look disagree percentage for the top servicers remained below one percent. Mortgage servicers continue to accurately calculate homeowner income, which is used to determine a homeowner's eligibility and modified payment amount under the program. In the third quarter, the average income calculation error rate for the top servicers was below three percent, and two servicers had zero percent error rates.
• Servicers are more effectively evaluating homeowners under program eligibility criteria as seen in the ""second look disagree"" category, which reflects the rate at which Treasury's program reviews disagree with the servicers' decision to find a homeowner ineligible for assistance.

For the third quarter of 2012, two servicers were found to need only minor improvement on the areas reviewed for program performance, while seven servicers were found to need moderate improvement. Although servicer performance in a particular compliance category can fluctuate from quarter to quarter, in general, servicers continue to show continued overall improvement in program implementation. All servicers, however, will need to continue to demonstrate progress in any areas identified in follow-up program reviews.
The November Housing Scorecard features key data on the health of the housing market and the impact of the Administration's foreclosure prevention programs, including:
The Administration's foreclosure programs are providing relief for millions of homeowners as we continue to recover from an unprecedented housing crisis. More than 1.3 million homeowner assistance actions have taken place through the Making Home Affordable Program, while the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) has offered more than 1.5 million loss mitigation and early delinquency interventions. The Administration's programs continue to encourage improved standards and processes in the industry, with HOPE Now lenders offering families and individuals more than 3.2 million proprietary mortgage modifications through September. HAMP continues to offer homeowners affordable and sustainable assistance to avoid foreclosure. As of October, more than 1.1 million homeowners have received a permanent modification through the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP), saving approximately $542 on their mortgage payments each month, and an estimated $16.2 billion to date. In October, 74 percent of homeowners with eligible non-GSE mortgages benefitted from principal reduction with their HAMP modification. Eighty-seven percent of homeowners entering the program in the last two years have received a permanent modification.

Also featured this month in the Administration's Housing Scorecard Regional Spotlight on market strength is Reno, Nevada. The challenges faced in the Reno-Sparks housing market have been more severe than in most areas in the nation.
""The continuing signs of stability that the national data show for the broader housing market are starting to show progress in Reno,"" said Poethig. ""The Administration is working hard to help all homeowners who have been hit hard during the crisis and, as this Regional Spotlight shows, our efforts have helped nearly 10,000 Reno households avoid foreclosure. A modest local economic recovery is underway, but we have much more to do to reach the many households who still face trouble and to help the Reno market recover more broadly.""
The Housing Scorecard Regional Spotlight features data on the health of the Reno housing market and impact of efforts to help homeowners at the local level including:
Economic conditions in Reno are slowly improving, but the local housing market remains fragile - with high concentrations of distressed mortgages. Reno homeowners continue to struggle with high rates of mortgage delinquency and foreclosure as the area placed 49th out of 366 metropolitan areas ranked for mortgages 90 or more days delinquent or in the foreclosure process. The Administration's Hardest Hit Fund and Neighborhood Stabilization Programs have fueled local foreclosure prevention efforts and market stability, while more than 9,700 Reno households have received mortgage modifications, many directly through Administration programs. Treasury provided $194 million to the state of Nevada to provide assistance to struggling homeowners through the Hardest Hit Fund. The number of homeowners benefitting from the program has continued to increase due to strong demand, and the state expects to commit all of their funds on behalf of families in the near term - well before the program end date of 2017. Moreover, approximately $29.9 million has been awarded to Reno through HUD's Neighborhood Stabilization Program to help purchase or redevelop residential properties and address the effects of abandoned and foreclosed housing. Both programs have helped provide increased stability to the Reno housing market. In addition, more than 10,000 Nevada homeowners are currently benefiting from over $900 million in refinancing, short sales and completed or trial loan modifications, including principal reduction on first and second lien mortgages provided under the landmark National Mortgage Servicing Settlement. Nationwide, the settlement has provided more than $26.1 billion in consumer relief benefits to over 300,000 families. That is in addition to the $2.5 billion in payments to participating states and $1.5 billion in direct payments to borrowers who were foreclosed upon between 2008 and 2011.

12/10/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-191.cfm,HUD Reports Slight Decline in Homelessness in 2012,"WASHINGTON - On a single night last January, 633,782 people were homeless in the United States, largely unchanged from the year before. In releasing HUD's latest national estimate of homelessness, U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan cited as hopeful that even during a historic housing and economic downturn, local communities are reporting significant declines in the number of homeless veterans and those experiencing long-term chronic homelessness. Read HUD's 2012 Point-in-Time Estimates of Homelessness, including community-level data.
HUD's annual 'point-in-time' estimate seeks to measure the scope of homelessness over the course of one night every January. Based on data reported by more than 3,000 cities and counties, last January's estimate reveals a marginal decline in overall homelessness (-0.4%) along with a seven percent drop in homelessness among veterans and those experiencing long-term or chronic homelessness.
Donovan said, ""We continue to see a stable level of homelessness across our country at a time of great stress for those at risk of losing their housing. We must redouble our efforts to target our resources more effectively to help those at greatest risk. As our nation's economic recovery takes hold, we will make certain that our homeless veterans and those living on our streets find stable housing so they can get on their path to recovery.""
""This report continues a trend that clearly indicates we are on the right track in the fight to end homelessness among Veterans. While this is encouraging news, we have more work to do and will not be satisfied until no Veteran has to sleep on the street,"" said Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric K. Shinseki. ""What success we have achieved is directly attributable to the strong leadership from the President and hard work by all of our federal, state, and community partners who are committed to ending Veteran homelessness.""
During one night in late January of 2012, local planners or ""Continuums of Care"" across the nation conducted a one-night count of their sheltered and unsheltered homeless populations. These one-night 'snapshot' counts are then reported to HUD as part of state and local grant applications. While the data reported to HUD does not directly determine the level of a community's grant funding, these estimates, as well as full-year counts, are crucial in understanding the scope of homelessness and measuring progress in reducing it.
The Obama Administration's strategic plan to end homelessness is called Opening Doors - a roadmap by 19 federal member agencies of the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness along with local and state partners in the public and private sectors. The plan puts the country on a path to end veterans and chronic homelessness by 2015; and to ending homelessness among children, family, and youth by 2020. The Plan presents strategies building upon the lesson that mainstream housing, health, education, and human service programs must be fully engaged and coordinated to prevent and end homelessness.
The plan, and its success, hinges on widespread implementation of an approach to preventing and ending homelessness known as Housing First: a strategy whose fundamental premise is that homeless assistance programs must respond, first, to the most urgent need of every homeless household—permanent housing. Then, around this housing must be provided the supports the individual or family needs to address other challenges in their lives. The reductions today are the result of two elements of the Housing First approach.
First, the decline in veteran homelessness in particular is attributed to the close collaboration between HUD and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs on a joint program called HUD-VA Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH). Research has demonstrated that for those who have been homeless the longest, often living on our streets for years at a time, permanent supportive housing—housing coupled with supportive services to address mental illness, substance addiction, and other challenges—not only ends homelessness for these vulnerable individuals, but also saves the taxpayer money by interrupting a costly cycle of emergency room visits, detoxes, and even jail terms. To date, HUD-VASH has provided more than 42,000 homeless veterans permanent supportive housing through rental vouchers provided by HUD along with supportive services and case management by VA. The national estimate announced today reveal a particularly large decrease in the number of homeless veterans - more than 7 percent.
The reductions reported today are also attributed in part to the impact of HUD's $1.5 billion Homeless Prevention and Rapid Re-housing Program (HPRP), a program designed to assist individuals and families confronted by a sudden economic crisis. Funded through the Recovery Act, HPRP spared more 1.3 million persons from homelessness by offering them short-term rent assistance, security and utility deposits, and moving expenses. HPRP—and the SSVF program whose grants VA is announcing today—reflect a Housing First approach inasmuch as it epitomizes the notion that the best interaction a family can have with the emergency response homeless system, such as shelters, is none at all, and if they have to enter the homeless system, the goal of that system should be to get them back into permanent housing as quickly as possible.
Key Findings of HUD's estimated count
On a single night in January 2012, local communities or 'Continuums of Care' reported:
633,782 people were homeless. This is largely unchanged (-0.4%) from January 2011, and a represents a reduction of 5.7 percent since 2007. Most homeless persons (62 percent) are individuals while 38 percent of homeless persons are in family households. Veteran homelessness fell by 7.2 percent (or 4,876 persons) since January 2011 and by 17.2 percent since January 2009. On a single night in January 2012, 62,619 veterans were homeless. Persons experiencing long-term or chronic homelessness declined 6.8 percent (or 7,254) from last year and 19.3 percent (or 23,939 persons) since 2007. Homelessness among individuals declined 1.4 percent (or 5,457) from a year ago and 6.8 percent since 2007. Meanwhile, the number of homeless families increased slightly (1.4 %) from last year though declining 3.7 percent since 2007. Street homelessness (""the unsheltered"" homeless population) was unchanged since January 2011 yet declined 13.1 percent (or 36,860 people) since 2007. Five states accounted for nearly half of the nation's population in 2012: California (20.7 percent), New York 11.0 percent), Florida (8.7 percent), Texas (5.4 percent), and Georgia (3.2 percent).

12/18/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-194.cfm,Four Housing Agencies Selected for Elite Program to Improve Federal Rental Assistance Programs,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan announced today that public housing agencies in Columbus, Ga.; Fairfax, Va.; Holyoke, Mass.; and Reno, Nev. have been selected to participate in HUD's Moving to Work (MTW) program. HUD selected these housing agencies for this innovative program that Congress authorized in 1996 through a competitive process. The MTW program is designed to provide local housing authorities with added flexibility to create and test innovative strategies to use Federal funding more efficiently to assist families either living in public housing
HUD's MTW program has given selected housing agencies the opportunity to create and study original, locally-developed housing and self-sufficiency strategies that encourage public housing or HCV families to become self-sufficient. The housing agencies selected today will join 35 others across the U.S. that have flexibility to use their Federal funds to help families ""move to work"" by providing incentives such as job training and educational programs that lead to employment and, ultimately, self-sufficiency. The agencies were selected from among a dozen that applied for MTW designation earlier this year.
""These housing agencies are already forging community partnerships and exploring new and exciting ways to more effectively utilize HUD's rental assistance programs,"" said Donovan. ""The agencies will join the other MTW agencies across the country in the mission to empower low-income families to achieve self-sufficiency.""
Ultimately, the program aims to make HUD's largest rental assistance programs more cost effective, while providing families with children more housing choices and incentives to move toward economic self-sufficiency."
12/20/2012:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2012/pr12-195.cfm,HUD Awards $26 Million to Convert Apartments into Assisted Living or Service-Enriched Senior Housing,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today awarded $26 million in grants to the owners of multi-family housing developments in nine states to convert some or all of their apartments into assisted living or service-enriched environments for elderly residents (see attached list for grant recipients).
The funding announced today is provided through HUD's Assisted Living Conversion Program which supports the transformation of housing into units that can accommodate the special needs of seniors seeking to remain in their homes or 'age in place.'
""We're getting older as a nation and with that demographic shift, there is a growing demand for affordable housing that will allow our seniors to live independently in their own homes,"" said Carol Galante, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Housing and Federal Housing Commissioner. ""These grants will help these apartment owners to convert their properties into assisted living or service-enriched environments that will allow seniors to remain in their homes for as long as they can.""
HUD's Assisted Living Conversion Program grants provide private, nonprofit owners of eligible developments with resources to convert some or all of the dwelling units in the project into an Assisted Living Facility (ALF) or Service-Enriched Housing (SEH) for elderly residents aging in place. Licensed and regulated by the State or local community, Assisted Living Facilities (ALFs) are designed to accommodate frail elderly and people with disabilities who can live independently but need assistance with activities of daily living (e.g., assistance with eating, bathing, grooming, dressing and home management activities). ALFs must provide support services such as personal care, transportation, meals, housekeeping, and laundry.
Service-Enriched Housing (SEH) is housing that is designed to accommodate frail elderly persons or elderly persons with service needs who are aging in place. Residents are able to live independently but need assistance with activities of daily living comparable to services typically provided in a licensed assisted living facility, such as healthcare-related services. These supportive services must be available through a licensed or certified third party service provider. Service-Enriched Housing is housing that accommodates the provision of services to elderly residents who need assistance with activities of daily living in order to live independently.
