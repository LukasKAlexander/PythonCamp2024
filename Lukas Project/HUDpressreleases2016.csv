01/08/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-001.cfm,HUD and VA Award $5.9 Million to 26 Tribes to Provide Permanent Homes for Native American Veterans Experiencing Homelessness,"WASHINGTON - For the first time, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) today awarded $5.9 million in grants to 26 Tribes to offer a permanent home and supportive services to Native American Veterans who are experiencing or at risk of experiencing homelessness. The Tribal HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (Tribal HUD-VASH) Program is a demonstration program that will combine $5.9 million in rental assistance from HUD with case management and clinical services provided by VA to serve 500 Native American Veterans. See chart below.
HUD Secretary Julián Castro announced the winners in Tulsa, Oklahoma, at the winter meeting of the Inter-Tribal Council of the Five Civilized Tribes.
""By targeting resources directly to Tribes, we can better honor the service and sacrifice of Native American Veterans who now need a roof over their heads,"" said Castro. ""These heroes deserve hope for a brighter future, and by offering permanent housing solutions, combined with needed services and case management, we can work with Tribes to end veteran homelessness.""
HUD invited (https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2015/10/21/2015-26748/ implementation-of-the-tribal-hud-va-supportive-housing-program) 30 eligible Tribes to seek Tribal HUD-VASH vouchers to help house and serve hundreds of Native American Veterans who are currently experiencing homelessness or at extreme risk of becoming homeless. Twenty-six Tribes, from Alaska to New Mexico, will deliver and manage the housing vouchers among their members who need them, on tribal lands.
""Targeting HUD-VASH vouchers to Veterans living on tribal lands opens new opportunities for helping Native American Veterans exit homelessness as quickly as possible"" said Secretary of Veteran Affairs Robert McDonald. ""We are pleased that recent statutory changes to the HUD-VASH Program made it possible to award these vouchers for use within Indian Country, where Native American Veterans have existing support systems that can be aided by those provided under the HUD-VASH Program to help the Veterans remain stably housed.""
Since 2008, more than 79,000 vouchers have been awarded and approximately 103,000 homeless Veterans have been served through the broader HUD-VASH program. Rental assistance and supportive services provided through HUD-VASH are a critical resource for local communities in ending homelessness among our nation's Veterans. In FY2015, Congress authorized funding for a demonstration program in order to expand the HUD-VASH program into Indian Country and directed HUD to coordinate with Indian Tribes, tribally designated housing entities (TDHEs), and other appropriate tribal organizations on the design of this program, and to ensure the effective delivery of housing assistance and supportive services to eligible Native American Veterans.
The Tribal HUD-VASH awards announced today are:
The Tribal HUD-VASH Program will provide rental assistance and supportive services to Native American Veterans who are homeless or at risk of homelessness living on or near a reservation or other Indian areas. HUD is making available $5.9 million in grant funding to Indian Tribes and TDHEs to fund rental assistance and associated administrative fees. Indian Tribes and TDHEs participating in this program will partner with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to provide healthcare assistance to eligible Native American Veterans."
01/12/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-002.cfm,HUD Files Charge Alleging California Foreclosure Rescue Companies Scammed Hispanic Homeowners,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced today that it is charging three Modesto, California, home loan modification companies and nine of their agents with violating the Fair Housing Act by targeting Hispanic homeowners for illegal or unfair loan audit and loan modification assistance because of their national origin. Read HUD's charge.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in housing transactions, including those related to home mortgage loans, because of national origin.
""Families struggling to stay in their homes need real help, not false promises that make a bad situation worse,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will continue to take appropriate action against individuals and companies that victimize unsuspecting homeowners because of where they come from or the language they speak.""
HUD's charge of discrimination alleges that The Home Loan Auditors, LLC; Century Law Center, LLC; SOE Assistance Center, Inc., and their agents lured struggling Hispanic homeowners into paying thousands of dollars for home loan audits that the homeowners never received and modification services that had little, if any, value. The companies allegedly exploited the homeowners' limited-English proficiency and used deceptive marketing in Spanish, at times making false representations, in order to mislead them. Ultimately, the homeowners lost their properties due to foreclosure.
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he or she may award damages to the complainants for their loss as a result of the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, to deter further discrimination, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties in order to vindicate the public interest. If the case is heard in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages to the complainants.
HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity and its partners investigate nearly 8,500 housing discrimination complaints annually. People who believe they are the victims of housing discrimination should contact HUD at (800) 669-9777 (voice), (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Additional information is available online. Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed at www.hud.gov/fairhousing or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, which can be accessed through Apple and Android devices."
01/15/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-003.cfm,Ophelia Basgal to Retire as HUD's Pacific/Hawaii Regional Director,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced that at the end of February, Ophelia Basgal is retiring from federal service after nearly 40 years of work to promote affordable housing and community development across the nation and throughout the Department's Pacific/Hawaii region.
Appointed in 2010, Ms. Basgal served as HUD's Regional Administrator for the states of Arizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada, the Territory of Guam, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and American Samoa. She brought a national reputation to HUD as an expert on housing and community development issues having served 27 years as the executive director of the Housing Authority in the County of Alameda, California. She also served on the bipartisan Congressional Millennial Housing Commission and was a member of, and held leadership positions in, several national housing organizations. Prior to joining HUD, Ms. Basgal was Vice President of Community Relations for PG&E, one of the nation's largest electric and gas utility company.
""I want to personally thank Ophelia for her deep dedication and commitment to the people and places HUD serves,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""Her passion, savvy and interpersonal skills set her apart. She is the consummate public servant who brought her vast knowledge and passion to work every single day.""
""This is a bittersweet day for HUD. We're losing an incomparable leader, one who we are going to miss very much,"" added Mary McBride, HUD's Assistant Deputy Secretary for Field Policy and Management. ""It isn't just Ophelia's broad array of experiences, in politics and in business. It was also the fact that she just brings an unmatched level of energy and enthusiasm and commitment to every single thing that she does. It's fair to say that Field Policy and Management could not have accomplished what we've accomplished without Ophelia.""
Reflecting on her retirement from public service, Ms. Basgal said, ""Nearly 40 years ago, I found my passion and it was helping to create opportunities to improve communities. HUD was the perfect fit to help me fulfill that desire. I will always be grateful to HUD for providing me with the place to help others and to work alongside colleagues who were as committed and passionate about the mission.""
During her tenure at HUD, Ms. Basgal was particularly focused on the Obama Administration's strategic plan to end homelessness, particularly among Veterans, by facilitating robust partnerships between federal agencies and state and local leaders. In addition, she reinforced a national movement to support place-based programs such the Strong Cities Strong Communities Initiative in Fresno, California; Promise Zones in Los Angeles and Sacramento; and a number of communities participating in HUD's Choice Neighborhoods Initiative.
As HUD's liaison with the City of San Francisco, Ms. Basgal worked to help transform severely distressed public housing in the City through the Department's Rental Assistance Demonstration resulting in one of the largest and most complex conversions in the country involving more than 1,000 housing units. Her background in the energy sector proved vital in the course of promoting energy efficiency in HUD-assisted housing.
Wayne Sauseda, the Deputy Regional Administrator, will serve as the acting Regional Administrator during this interim period."

EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take two months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, 4 months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2%) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90-percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised about three percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found on our web site listed above.
* 90% confidence interval includes zero. The Census Bureau does not have sufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero.

01/20/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-005.cfm,HUD Offers Approximately $15 Million in Grants to Test a New Approach to Help Low-Income Seniors Age in Place,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced it is making approximately $15 million available to test a promising housing and services model for low-income seniors to age in their own homes and delay or avoid the need for nursing home care. Read HUD's Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) (www.grants.gov/view-opportunity.html?oppId=281074).
HUD's Supportive Services Demonstration for Elderly Households in HUD-Assisted Multifamily Housing will offer three-year grants to eligible owners of HUD-assisted senior housing developments to cover the cost of a full-time Enhanced Service Coordinator and a part-time Wellness Nurse. The purpose of the Demonstration is to test the effectiveness of this enhanced supportive services model for elderly households and to evaluate the value of enhanced service coordination paired with affordable housing for seniors. The demonstration will be independently evaluated to determine the impact of the enhanced supportive services model on:
aging in place in HUD-assisted senior developments; avoiding early transitions to institutional care, and; preventing unnecessary and often costly health care events-such as some emergency room visits and hospitalizations-for residents in HUD-assisted senior developments.
• aging in place in HUD-assisted senior developments;
• avoiding early transitions to institutional care, and;
• preventing unnecessary and often costly health care events-such as some emergency room visits and hospitalizations-for residents in HUD-assisted senior developments.
HUD and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) collaborated on several research initiatives to inform the design of this Demonstration including a study in 2010 to identify promising models for aging in place in assisted housing and to develop a design for a seniors and services demonstration intended to support aging in place, and an evaluation launched in 2012 of the Support and Services at Home (SASH) demonstration in Vermont. Lessons from each have informed the design of the demonstration announced today.
HUD requires prospective grantees to submit applications electronically at www.grants.gov. Applicants are urged to sign up for Grants.gov's notification service to receive periodic updates or changes to these grant offerings."
01/21/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-006.cfm,HUD Awards $1 Billion Through National Disaster Resilience Competition,"WASHINGTON - Today, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Julián Castro and the Rockefeller Foundation announced the winners of the $1 billion National Disaster Resilience Competition (NDRC). Secretary Castro traveled to Norfolk, Virginia where he joined Governor Terry McAuliffe in announcing the winners of the competition. Through NDRC, HUD will provide funding for resilient housing and infrastructure projects to states and communities that were impacted by major disasters between 2011 and 2013.
The National Disaster Resilience Competition winners are:
Read a summary of each of the NDRC awardees above.
""Climate change is real and we must think more seriously about how to plan for it,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""The grants we award today, and the other sources of capital these grants will leverage, will make communities stronger, more resilient and better prepared for future natural disasters such as floods and wildfires. The National Disaster Resilience Competition exemplifies how government can work hand-in-hand with the philanthropic and private sectors to create lasting partnerships that will allow us to together face the challenges of tomorrow.""
""The National Disaster Resilience Competition demonstrated where we are moving as a country, embracing resilience as a way to build a better future,"" said Dr. Judith Rodin, President of The Rockefeller Foundation. ""The communities awarded funding through the Competition - and in fact all those that competed - today have a greater awareness of their vulnerabilities and strengths and what they need to do to be ready for whatever comes their way. This is the heart of resilience.""
The competition took place in two phases, with final winners selected from previously announced 40 states and local communities designated as finalists. Finalists were then asked to submit specific projects that would advance their community's resilience plans. More than 25 federal agencies or offices, and 100 industry experts were involved in the implementation of the 16-month long competition.
NDRC is funded through Community Development Block Grant-Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) appropriations provided by the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act of 2013.
NDRC was developed in response to requests from state, local, and tribal leaders seeking to build resilience and better prepare their communities for the impacts of climate change, following the model of the Rebuild by Design Competition, and the recommendations of the Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force. The National Disaster Resilience Competition was designed to promote risk assessment, stakeholder engagement, and resilience planning in communities where the risks of disaster are projected to increase substantially due to climate change.
Partnership with Rockefeller Foundation
The Rockefeller Foundation worked closely with HUD and state and local governments to encourage and support a culture of resilience around disaster preparedness and planning in American communities. Through a companion effort, the Rockefeller Foundation provided targeted technical assistance to the applicants and supported a stakeholder-driven process, informed by the best available data, to identify recovery needs and innovative solutions. The strategic partnership between the Rockefeller Foundation and HUD drew on the successful strategies of the Rebuild by Design (www.rebuildbydesign.org/) competition, where the Foundation provided lead support for administration of the competition and community engagement.

01/28/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-008.cfm,FHA to Cut Insurance Rates on Multifamily Mortgages,"WASHINGTON - In an effort to help preserve and increase the amount of affordable, quality rental housing across the country, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) today announced a multifamily insurance rate reduction designed to encourage capital financing of affordable and energy-efficient apartments. The rate reductions announced today will take effect on April 1, 2016, and will directly impact FHA's Multifamily Housing Programs and properties housing low- and moderate-income families and/or developments installing energy-efficient systems or building within federal energy guidelines. Read FHA's new Multifamily Insurance Rates (www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=HUD_FRDOC_0001-4339).
U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Julián Castro made the announcement today during a visit to an affordable housing complex in Columbus, Ohio. FHA estimates that the multifamily insurance rate reductions will spur the rehabilitation of an additional 12,000 units of affordable housing per year nationally, meaning over the next three years nearly 40,000 families could benefit from higher quality and affordable housing.
""Families across the country are struggling through an affordable housing crisis,"" said Secretary Castro. ""By reducing our rates, this Administration is taking a significant step to encourage the preservation and development of affordable and energy efficient housing in communities large and small. This way, hard-working families won't have to make the false choice between quality or affordable housing.""
FHA's new annual multifamily insurance rates include:
For 'Broadly Affordable' housing (at least 90% of the units are under Section 8 contract and/or covered by Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) affordability requirements), FHA is lowering annual rates to 25 basis points, a reduction of 20 or 25 basis points from current rates. For Affordable mixed-income properties that is properties that set-aside units based on affordability including partial LIHTC, partial section 8, inclusionary zoning, or other local affordability requirements, FHA is lowering annual rates to 35 basis points, a reduction of 10 to 35 basis points from current rates. For energy-efficient properties (those committed to industry-recognized green building standards, AND committed to energy performance in the top 25 percent of multifamily buildings nationwide), FHA is lowering annual rates to 25 basis points, a reduction of 20 to 45 basis points. Qualification for the top 25% will be determined using EPA's Portfolio manager 1-100 score. To ensure that the Broadly Affordable and energy-efficient properties benefit directly from the lower rates, FHA will limit the fees that can be charged on these loans. Multifamily insurance rates for market-rate properties that are not energy efficient (as defined above) will remain unchanged.
• For 'Broadly Affordable' housing (at least 90% of the units are under Section 8 contract and/or covered by Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) affordability requirements), FHA is lowering annual rates to 25 basis points, a reduction of 20 or 25 basis points from current rates.
• For Affordable mixed-income properties that is properties that set-aside units based on affordability including partial LIHTC, partial section 8, inclusionary zoning, or other local affordability requirements, FHA is lowering annual rates to 35 basis points, a reduction of 10 to 35 basis points from current rates.
• For energy-efficient properties (those committed to industry-recognized green building standards, AND committed to energy performance in the top 25 percent of multifamily buildings nationwide), FHA is lowering annual rates to 25 basis points, a reduction of 20 to 45 basis points. Qualification for the top 25% will be determined using EPA's Portfolio manager 1-100 score.
• To ensure that the Broadly Affordable and energy-efficient properties benefit directly from the lower rates, FHA will limit the fees that can be charged on these loans.
• Multifamily insurance rates for market-rate properties that are not energy efficient (as defined above) will remain unchanged.
FHA is also reducing upfront premiums to support the affordable housing and energy efficiency goals stated above and to streamline the premium structure. Upfront insurance rates will be set at 25 basis points for Broadly Affordable and Energy-Efficient properties and 35 basis points for Mixed-Income properties. Upfront premiums for market rate properties that are not energy-efficient will remain unchanged.
Each year the U.S. loses more than 300,000 affordable housing units. FHA's multifamily rate reductions will help preserve and maintain affordable housing by making rehabilitation more cost-effective and allowing the U.S. to better preserve its limited affordable housing stock. Most of the affordable housing in the U.S. was built prior to 1980, making it more than 30 years old. These premium reductions will allow developers to renovate this housing, providing families with better quality places to live. The reductions will allow owners of affordable housing developments to free up the capital needed to support higher levels of rehabilitation or increase the number of affordable units-both of which will increase the access families will have.
Nearly half (49.3 percent) of all renter households spent more than 30 percent of income on housing in 2014, including more than one quarter (26.4 percent) who devoted more than half of income to housing.[1] Since 2000, rents have risen while the number of renters who need affordable housing has increased. The pressure to find affordable housing to rent is more severe for very poor households. Only 28 of every 100 extremely low-income renter households in the United States were able to find decent, affordable homes in 2013.
Encouraging more energy efficient multifamily housing
One-out-of-every-four U.S. households live in multifamily housing units and spend approximately a combined $40 billion on energy costs each year. Making these housing units 20 percent more energy efficient would save $8 billion per year and cut greenhouse gas emissions by over 430 million tons. The lower multifamily insurance rate for energy-efficient projects will contribute to this effort by encouraging owners to adopt higher standards for construction and rehabilitation, resulting in greater energy and water efficiency, reduced utility costs, and improved indoor air quality.
Lowering rates in a responsible way
The reduced rates announced today are made possible by the strong health of the FHA Multifamily portfolio,which stands at a historically low default/delinquency rate of 0.15 percent. FHA's Multifamily business traditionally generates significant revenue for taxpayers; these changes will leverage over $400 million in new mortgage financing for affordable housing/energy-efficient development without significantly decreasing overall revenue. Even with these reductions, affordable and energy-efficient loans originated in Fiscal Year 2016 are projected to generate net revenue for the federal government.

02/01/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-009.cfm,HUD and First Tennessee Bank Reach $1.9 Million Settlement,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today a $1.9 million settlement with Memphis-based First Tennessee Bank, resolving allegations that the bank discriminated against African-American and Hispanic applicants by denying them mortgage loans and by allegedly failing to place bank branches in minority-concentrated areas. Read the agreement here.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to discriminate in the terms, conditions, or privileges of sale of a dwelling because of race or national origin. The Act also makes it unlawful for any person or other entity whose business includes residential real estate-related transactions to discriminate against any person in making available such a transaction, or in the terms or conditions of such a transaction, because of race or national origin.
""Every family should have an equal shot at becoming a homeowner, regardless of what they look like or where they come from. Anything less is against the law,"" said HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity Gustavo Velasquez. ""HUD remains committed to ensuring that banks and other lenders comply with the Fair Housing Act.""
The Conciliation Agreement stems from a complaint the National Community Reinvestment Coalition filed with HUD alleging the bank denied loan applications from African-American and Hispanic borrowers at disproportionate rates and failed to place bank branches in minority-concentrated areas in Chattanooga, Knoxville, Memphis and Nashville.
Under the agreement, First Tennessee Bank will establish a $1.5 million subsidy fund to provide interest rate reductions on home mortgages, and down payment or closing cost assistance to qualified borrowers in identified portions of Chattanooga, Knoxville, Memphis and Nashville.
In addition, First Tennessee Bank agreed to partner with one or more community-based organizations to provide home repair or other grants to help existing homeowners repair their properties in predominantly minority communities, or partner with one or more community-based organizations to provide credit, financial, homeownership or foreclosure prevention services to residents in the affected areas. Specifically, First Tennessee Bank will contribute $270,000 over three years to support these partnership efforts and an additional $105,000 to fund similar services to be provided directly by the National Community Reinvestment Coalition
Finally, the bank will pay $25,000 in damages to the National Community Reinvestment Coalition.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed at www.hud.gov/fairhousing or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, which can be accessed through Apple and Android devices."
02/01/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-010.cfm,FHA Issues New Multifamily Handbook,"WASHINGTON - The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) today published a new consolidated handbook to guide lenders on underwriting all FHA-insured multifamily housing construction and rehabilitation transactions. FHA's new MAP Guide offers a new operating manual for multifamily underwriting through the Multifamily Accelerated Processing program. Read FHA's new updated MAP Guide on HUD's website.
FHA's new Multifamily MAP Guide is intended to cut the time required to approve loan applications and to assure consistent application of program requirements and credit standards across all HUD processing offices. While all provisions of this new MAP Guide will become effective for all applications for FHA multifamily mortgage insurance received after May 28, 2016, FHA has the authority to approve transactions that incorporate the new policies immediately for projects with Firm Commitments issued or reissued after date of publication.
""Today, I'm proud to release our new and improved 'owner's manual' for FHA's Multifamily housing programs that we hope will make it easier for our partners to do business with us,"" said Ed Golding, Jr., HUD's Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for HUD's Office of Housing. ""This new guide is the product of a substantial feedback we've received from those who will actually be using our programs to finance the production and preservation of FHA-insured multifamily housing.""
There are approximately 90 MAP lenders originating FHA-insured multifamily housing developments. Updating and clarifying the MAP guide supports an estimated $11 billion of FHA insured lending each year. In addition, the updated MAP Guide reflects significant progress over the past five years to improve processing times and to better align FHA multifamily transactions with industry standards and practices, especially those supported by the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) Program.
On February 27, 2015, FHA released a draft MAP guide and sought public feedback. Revisions incorporated in the new MAP Guide can be categorized into four main areas:
• Technical corrections and edits based on operational experience;
• Integration of previously published policy (e.g. Mortgagee Letters, Housing Notices, Memos, and less formal guidance) issued since 2011;
• Incorporation of the significant organizational and operational business model changes associated with the Multifamily for Tomorrow transformation initiative; and,
• Policy revisions.
To support industry adoption of this new MAP Guide, FHA plans a series of conference calls and training with stakeholders (MAP lenders, primarily) to highlight changes from current practice, and answer questions."
02/02/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-011.cfm,Connecticut Landlords Agree to Settle HUD Fair Housing Complaint Alleging They Discriminated Against Families with Children,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced an agreement with a group of Connecticut landlords to resolve allegations they discriminated against families with children. HUD reached the agreement with New Britain-based Green New Britain, LLC, and PBJ Management, and their on-site property manager for allegedly refusing to rent a two-bedroom apartment to a single mother and her two young children. Read the agreement.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to deny or limit housing because a family has children under the age of 18. Housing may exclude children only if it meets the Fair Housing Act's exemption for housing for senior citizens.
""When a property owner refuses to show an available unit to a family because they have children, they're not only denying them a housing opportunity, they're violating the law,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""No one should have to hide who they are or who their family is while looking for a place to live. This agreement reaffirms HUD's commitment to ensuring that housing providers treat all applicants the same, regardless of gender, race or family status.""
The case came to HUD's attention when a single mother of four-year-old twin boys filed a complaint alleging that Green New Britain, LLC denied her the opportunity to rent a two-bedroom unit in Greenview Apartments because she has children. The woman filed her complaint with the help of Connecticut Fair Housing Center, a HUD partner under the Department's Fair Housing Initiatives Program (FHIP). According to the complaint, after learning that she has two sons, Greenview's property manager told her that there would be some clean-up involved and that he would get back to her. But the manager never did.
Two weeks later, the woman's mother called the property manager on her daughter's behalf. When the mother reminded him that her daughter has two children, the manager allegedly said that he would need to consult with his wife, who would not be back in town for two weeks.
Suspecting discrimination, the woman then asked her cousin to call about the unit. According to the complaint, when the property manager asked the cousin who would be living there, she explained that it was for her and her husband. The property manager then allegedly offered to show her the apartment the next day.
Under the Conciliation Agreement, Green New Britain, LLC, will pay the mother $19,500 and modify its website to state that families with children are welcome. Green New Britain, LLC, also agreed to amend its advertising policy to clearly state that families with children are welcome, modify its leasing procedures to ensure that families with children are treated fairly, and have staff attend fair housing training.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY).

02/02/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-012.cfm,HUD Considers New Rule on 'Over Income' Public Housing Residents,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced the agency is considering a new rule to ensure that individuals and families residing in public housing actually need housing assistance should their incomes grow well beyond the levels required for their initial admission. HUD is seeking public comment on methods to address 'over-income' public housing residents who continue to reside in public housing as other families wait for vacant units to become available. Read HUD's notice.
About 1.1 million families currently reside in public housing across the U.S. To qualify for public housing, local Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) certify applicants' incomes are sufficiently low for admission. In addition, HUD requires PHAs to conduct annual reviews of their residents' incomes for purposes of calculating the proper level of subsidy for each household.
However, current law and regulation do not require eviction or termination of residency in circumstances when a household's income increases significantly and consistently over time, even if that family pays full market rent and receives no subsidy at all. Given the urgent need for affordable rental housing in many communities, HUD is considering ways to possibly limit public housing residency to those households that actually require housing assistance.
Background
The United States Housing Act of 1937 provides that public housing units shall be rented only to families who are low income at the time of their initial occupancy. Each year, HUD revises the income limits that determine initial eligibility for public housing. In general, HUD sets the low-income limit at 80 percent; very low-income limit at 50 percent; and extremely low-income limit at 30 percent of the median income for the county or metropolitan area in which the household resides. Income limits vary from area to area and may be adjusted based on local market conditions.
Last year, HUD's OIG issued a report that identified approximately 25,000 public housing families with incomes slightly, moderately or, in rare cases, substantially above the income limits that qualified them for initial admission. In a letter to PHAs on September 3, 2015, HUD strongly recommended that local PHAs adopt reasonable policies that clearly define 'over income', provide a safety net for fluctuating incomes, and offer protections for hardship cases.
In anticipation of a proposed rulemaking, HUD specifically solicits comment on the following issues:
• How should HUD define income that ""significantly"" exceeds the income limit for public housing residency? Should such higher amount be determined by dollar amount, by a percentage, or as a function of the current income limit, and what should the amount be?
• Should area cost of living and family finances be taken into consideration when determining whether an individual or family no longer needs public housing assistance? Are there limits to the circumstances in which said data should be requested and applied in a determination?
• What period of time in which an individual or family has had income that significantly exceeds the income limits should be determined as indicative that the individual or family no longer needs public housing assistance?
• How should local housing market conditions or housing authority wait list data be considered?
• What period of time should be allowed for an individual or family to find alternative housing?
• Are there exceptions to eviction or termination of tenancy that HUD should consider beyond those listed in HUD's regulation?
• Should HUD allow over-income individuals or families to remain in public housing, while paying unsubsidized or fair market, rent? How would such a provision impact PHA operations and finances?
• Should HUD require a local appeals process for individuals or families deemed over- income?
• Where over-income policies have been implemented, what were the results to public housing residents and PHAs? What were the specific positive and negative impacts?
• What financial impact would over-income policies have on PHA operations, and how can any negative impacts be mitigated?
• What are the potential costs and benefits to public housing residents and PHAs that could result from the forcible eviction of public housing tenants?
• What evidence currently exists in favor of or against the adoption of this type of policy?
It is the responsibility of HUD and PHAs to ensure that public housing units are available to those who need HUD assistance. All comments directed to steps that HUD and PHAs can take to ensure availability of public housing units for individuals and families meeting the income limits are welcome. There are two methods for submitting public comments:
• By mail: Comments may be submitted by mail to the Regulations Division, Office of General Counsel, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 7th Street SW, Room 10276, Washington, DC 20410-0500. Due to security measures at all federal agencies, however, submission of comments by mail often results in delayed delivery. To ensure timely receipt of comments, HUD recommends that comments submitted by mail be submitted at least two weeks in advance of the public comment deadline.
• By electronic submission: Interested persons may submit comments electronically through the Federal eRulemaking Portal at http://www.regulations.gov. HUD strongly encourages commenters to submit comments electronically. Electronic submission of comments allows the commenter maximum time to prepare and submit a comment, ensures timely receipt by HUD, and enables HUD to make comments immediately available to the public. Comments submitted electronically can be viewed by other commenters and interested members of the public."
02/03/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-013.cfm,HUD Secretary Castro and Google Fiber Announce First Public Housing Units to be Connected to Ultra High Speed Internet Through ConnectHome Initiative,"WASHINGTON - Building on the Obama Administration's goal to expand high speed broadband to all Americans, today, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Julián Castro and Google Fiber Vice President, Dennis Kish, announced that the West Bluff Townhomes in Kansas City, Missouri will be the first public housing development to be connected to Google Fiber's ultra-high speed (gigabit speed, or up to 1000 mbps) internet through the ConnectHome Initiative. The 100 housing units at West Bluff are now able to sign up for Google Fiber gigabit speed internet free of cost. Over the next several months, gigabit service will be available to another 1300 public housing units in the Kansas City metro area. Additionally, Google Fiber will be bringing those high speeds to HUD assisted and affordable housing in all fiber cities, including the ConnectHome fiber cities of Atlanta, GA, Durham, NC, San Antonio, TX and Nashville, TN.
ConnectHome is a public-private collaboration to narrow the digital divide for families with school-age children who live in HUD-assisted housing. Through ConnectHome, Internet service providers, non-profits and the private sector will offer broadband access, technical training, digital literacy programs, and devices for residents in assisted housing units in 28 communities across the nation. ConnectHome creates a platform to help ensure that students have access to high-speed Internet for studying and doing their homework at home, as well as in school.
""For far too many low-income families, and especially their children, connecting to the Web remains a distant dream,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""Knowledge and education are the currency of this 21st Century economy, and Google Fiber is helping ensure that all children, no matter where they live, have access to the tools they need to be competitive in their schoolwork and close the digital divide.""
""At Google Fiber, we believe that superfast speeds and access to home broadband can move entire communities forward. That's why we've partnered (http://googlefiberblog.blogspot.com/2015/07/connecthome-google-fiber.html) with ConnectHome (http://connecthome.hud.gov/) to bring some of the fastest Internet speeds to those who need it most. Families in these properties will be able to access gigabit Internet service, at no cost to the housing authority or to residents,"" said Dennis Kish, Vice President of Google Fiber.
Congressman Emanuel Cleaver, II added, ""Last year, I called on Google and the Kansas City Housing Authority to help close Kansas City's digital divide and as the Ranking Member on the Housing and Insurance subcommittee in Congress, I have made closing the digital divide a top priority. Today's announcement is a strong step in the right direction and Secretary Castro and I agree that access to high-speed Internet is no longer a luxury but a necessity in our current global economy.""
Google Fiber is launching this $0/month gigabit Internet service for select affordable housing properties in all of its current and future markets. The company is working with local providers to identify which properties it will connect in future cities. Inspired by its early success of the work (http://googlefiberblog.blogspot.com/2014/11/unlocking-connection-for-austin.html) with the Housing Authority for the City of Austin, Google Fiber is complementing its free gigabit Internet service by working with local partners to make new investments in computer labs and digital literacy classes so residents learn the skills they need to get online.
Since 2009, the private and public sectors have invested over $260 billion into new broadband infrastructure, and three in four Americans now use broadband at home. Despite this significant progress, one in four American families still don't access the internet at home, particularly lower-income families with children. While nearly two-thirds of America's lowest-income households own a computer, less than half have a home internet subscription. HUD's ConnectHome initiative strives to ensure that students can access the same level of high-speed Internet at home that they possess in their classrooms.
Eight nationwide Internet Service Providers including; Google Fiber, Cherokee Communications, Pine Telephone, Suddenlink Communications, Vyve Broadband, CenturyLink, Cox Communications and Sprint have announced they are partnering with mayors, public housing authorities, non-profit groups, and for-profit entities to bridge the gap in digital access for students living in assisted housing units.

02/08/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-015.cfm,HUD Proposes to Exempt Recreational Vehicles from Manufactured Housing Standards,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today (HUD) announced a proposed rule to exempt certain recreational vehicles from HUD's Manufactured Housing Procedural and Enforcement Regulations. HUD's proposed rule seeks to revise the exemption for recreational vehicles that are not self-propelled and is based upon a recommendation from an advisory committee made up of manufactured housing producers, retailers, consumers and the general public. Read HUD's proposed rule.
The Manufactured Housing Consensus Committee (MHCC) recommended that HUD define a recreational vehicle as one built on a vehicular structure, not certified as a manufactured home, designed only for recreational use and not as a primary residence or for permanent occupancy, and built and certified in accordance with either the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) or American National Standards Institute (ANSI) consensus standards for recreational vehicles.
HUD is proposing to adopt the MHCC's recommendation but modifying it to require certification with the updated ANSI standard, A119.5-15, and by including a requirement that units claiming this exemption prominently display a notice stating that the unit is designed only for recreational use, and not as a primary residence or permanent dwelling. This notice reflects the intent of the MHCC in its recommendation to draw a clear distinction between the two products.
The Manufactured Housing Consensus Committee (MHCC) is a statutory Federal Advisory Committee body charged with providing recommendations to the Secretary on the revisions and interpretation of HUD's manufactured home construction and safety standards and related procedural and enforcement regulations.
Background
The National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974 authorized HUD to establish and amend the Federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards. The Act as amended defines ""manufactured home"" as ""a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which, in the traveling mode, is eight body feet or more in width or forty body feet or more in length, or, when erected on site, is three hundred twenty or more square feet, and which is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used as a dwelling with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities, and includes the plumbing, heating, air-conditioning, and electrical systems contained therein;…""
Over the intervening years, HUD sought to clarify and simplify this exemption. In December of 2014, the MHCC recommended that HUD adopt language that more clearly distinguishes recreational vehicles and manufactured housing.
There are two methods for submitting comments to the proposed rule published today*:
1. By Mail. Comments may be submitted by mail to the Regulations Division, Office of General Counsel, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 7th Street, SW, Room 10276, Washington, DC 20410-0500.

02/09/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-016.cfm,HUD Releases Proposed 2017 Budget,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today unveiled President Obama's proposed HUD Budget for Fiscal Year 2017 which is focused on helping Americans to secure and maintain, affordable housing, ending homelessness, making our communities more resilient from natural disasters and protecting people from housing discrimination. HUD's work is critical to the Administration's efforts to strengthen communities, bolster the economy, and improve the quality of life of the American people.
HUD's 2017 Budget includes $48.9 billion in gross discretionary funding and $11.3 billion in new mandatory spending over ten years, with an emphasis on supporting 4.5 million households through rental assistance; increasing homeless assistance; supporting tribal communities and providing opportunities to Native American youth; and making targeted investments in communities to help revitalize high-poverty neighborhoods and improve housing affordability.
Read HUD's proposed FY 2017 Budget on HUD's website.
""HUD's proposed budget was built on the values that we uphold as Americans. That our entire nation benefits when our children grow up in a community that's full of promise, not problems,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""When a hard-working family is able to responsibly buy their first-home, put down roots, and build wealth. When homeless veterans are able to get the housing they need to succeed in the very nation they risked so much to protect. When every person gets a fair shot and a fair shake to achieve their dreams.""

Helping Families Secure Quality Housing
HUD's 2017 budget maintains a core commitment to provide opportunity for residents of low-income neighborhoods. The Budget provides funding for rental housing assistance to support 4.5 million low-income families, including $20.9 billion for the Housing Choice Voucher program to help approximately 2.2 million low-income families afford decent housing in neighborhoods of their choice.
The Budget also includes $10.8 billion for the Project-Based Rental Assistance program, which supports 12 months of funding for rental assistance contracts with public and private owners who maintain affordable rental housing for 1.2 million families, and $6.45 billion in operating and capital subsidies to preserve affordable public housing for 1.1 million families.
Housing Choice Voucher Program
The Budget provides $2.1 billion in Public Housing Authority (PHAs) administrative fees using a new evidence-based formula that not only more accurately reflects the actual cost of running the program, but ensures that PHAs have sufficient resources to provide low-income families greater access to opportunity areas. In addition, the Budget requests $15 million for a new mobility counseling demonstration that is designed to help HUD-assisted families move and stay in higher-opportunity neighborhoods. A portion of the funding will also support an evaluation to measure the impact of the counseling pilot to further inform the policy process and design.
Native American Housing and Community Development
The Budget invests $700 million for Native American Housing Block Grants, $50 million above the 2016 enacted level, to address severe overcrowding and substandard housing conditions in Indian Country. An additional $20 million is provided for projects to improve outcomes for Native youth, such as the construction or renovation of community centers, health clinics, transitional housing, pre-school/Head Start facilities and teacher housing, and up to $5 million for Jobs-Plus will be used to implement a demonstration of the Jobs-Plus model in Indian Country to boost employment and earnings.

Ending Homelessness
To support the Opening Doors Initiative, the Budget provides $11 billion in mandatory spending and $112 million in discretionary spending in housing vouchers and rapid rehousing to reach and maintain the goal of ending homelessness among families with children by 2020. In addition, the Budget maintains programs dedicated to ending veterans homelessness, and within the $2.7 billion provided for Homeless Assistance Grants, the Budget maintains existing projects, creates 25,500 new units of permanent supportive housing to end chronic homelessness, and invests $25 million in new projects targeted to youth experiencing homelessness.

Strengthening All Communities in this Century of Cities
To empower local communities, the 2017 Budgetinvests $200 million to transform neighborhoods with distressed HUD-assisted housing and concentrated poverty into opportunity-rich, mixed-income neighborhoods through the Choice Neighborhoods program. Consistent with the Administration's place-based approach to helping communities address their self-identified priorities, Choice Neighborhoods grantees develop a comprehensive neighborhood plan that addresses the broader needs of the community, including public safety, local schools, economic development, and other critical community improvements. Choice Neighborhoods grantees have leveraged over $3.69 billion, including new and refocused funds from private investors, banks, cities, universities, foundations, and a range of local partners.
HUD is proposing to provide $50 million to the Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) program to help local public housing agencies to finance the recapitalization of more than 180,000 units of public housing and a targeted expansion to include certain properties that provide housing for the elderly.
The Budget also reflects HUD's commitment to providing communities with new flexibilities to help families achieve self-sufficiency. The Budget provides $35 million for Jobs-Plus to help public housing residents secure employment and increase their earnings through job training and financial incentives. The Budget also provides $75 million for the Family Self-Sufficiency program to link HUD-assisted households with job training, child care, transportation, financial literacy and other supportive services, and help them build assets through interest-bearing escrow accounts."
02/12/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-017.cfm,"HUD Awards $1.8 Billion to Improve, Preserve Nation's Public Housing","WASHINGTON - U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro today announced HUD is allocating more $1.8 billion to public housing authorities in all 50 states, as well as the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands to make needed capital improvements in their properties. See attached funding chart and view funding by public housing authority.
The grants announced today are provided through HUD's Capital Fund Program, which offers annual funding to approximately 3,100 public housing authorities to build, repair, renovate and/or modernize the public housing in their communities. These housing authorities use the funding to complete large-scale improvements such as replacing roofs or making energy-efficient upgrades to replace old plumbing and electrical systems.
To help provide residents with decent, safe and sanitary housing and respond to the growing demand for affordable rental housing, the Obama Administration proposed the Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD), a comprehensive strategy that complements the Capital Fund Program and offers a long-term solution to preserve and enhance the country's affordable housing stock, including leveraging public and private funding to make critically needed improvements.
""HUD has a responsibility to provide public housing residents with a quality and safe roof over their heads,"" said HUD Secretary Julian Castro. ""This funding, in addition to assistance from the private sector through HUD's Rental Assistance Demonstration Program, will help housing authorities address longstanding capital improvements and preserve and enhance America's affordable housing.""
For more than 75 years, the federal government has been investing billions of dollars in developing and maintaining public housing - including providing critical support through the Capital Fund grants announced today. Nonetheless, there has been a net loss of over 135,000 public housing units since fiscal year 2000, representing an average loss of approximately 9,000 units annually.
In 2011, HUD released Capital Needs in the Public Housing Program, a third-party independent study that estimated the capital needs in the public housing stock in the U.S. The study found the nation's 1.1 million public housing units are facing an estimated $25.6 billion in large-scale repairs. Unlike routine maintenance, capital needs are extensive improvements required to make the housing decent and economically sustainable, such as replacing roofs or updating plumbing and electrical systems to increase energy efficiency.
Since Congress authorized the RAD demonstration in November of 2011, early results show it is generating significant additional capital for public and assisted housing. HUD has made awards to 60,000 public and assisted housing units in more than 340 different projects across the country. Through these awards, housing authorities have proposed to generate approximately $3 billion in capital repairs by leveraging private debt and equity, which will preserve or replace distressed units and support local jobs in their communities - all without additional federal resources.

02/12/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-018.cfm,HUD Awards More Than $55 Million for Affordable Housing and Community Development in Native American Communities,"WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced $55.5 million to 75 Native American communities throughout the country to improve housing conditions and stimulate community development, including construction projects and local jobs for low- and moderate-income families. The grants are provided through HUD's Indian Community Development Block Grant (ICDBG) Program, which supports a wide range of community development and affordable housing activities. See attached list of grantees and read individual project summaries.
""Every family deserves the chance to have a decent home, economic opportunity and vibrant neighborhoods to call their own,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""Today we make another critical investment in helping tribal nations address affordable housing and community development needs in their communities.""
The ICDBG program was established in 1977 to help Indian tribes and Alaska Native villages meet their community development needs. Federally recognized Indian tribes, bands, groups or nations (including Alaska Indian, Aleuts and Eskimos,) Alaska Native villages, and eligible tribal organizations compete for this funding.
""The goal of the ICDBG program is to develop viable Indian and Alaska Native communities, including decent housing, suitable living environments, and economic opportunities,"" said HUD Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary Lourdes Castro Ramírez. ""Awardees can use the funding to rehabilitate or build new housing or to buy land for housing; for infrastructure such as roads, water and sewer facilities; and to spur economic development including jobs.""
This year's projects include building or rehabilitating homes for many tribes. Other uses include the construction of a new energy efficient health clinic by the Circle Tribal Community in Alaska. The Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation in Kansas will use its grant to construct a Language and Cultural Learning Center to help preserve the language and culture of their ancestors. In Oklahoma, the Seminole Nation will be using its funding to construct the Seminole Nation Veterans Affairs Department.
HUD administers six programs that are specifically targeted to American Indian, Alaska Native, or Native Hawaiian individuals and families, and federally recognized tribal governments. Through the Native American Housing Assistance and Self Determination Act (NAHASDA), HUD will provide more than $718 million to fund programs to support housing and development initiatives in American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian communities. Through innovative programming, American Indian and Alaska Native tribal governments have created sustainable and community-driven solutions to their housing and community development challenges."
02/16/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-019.cfm,HUD Allocates More Than $660 Million to Native American Communities to Support Affordable Housing,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today announced more than $660 million in grant allocations to 587 Native American tribes in 35 states (see list below). Indian Housing Block Grant (IHBG) allocations are distributed each year to eligible Indian tribes or their tribally designated housing entities for a range of affordable housing activities.
IHBG funds benefit low-income families living on Indian reservations or in other American Indian and Alaska Native communities. The amount of each grant is based on a formula that considers local needs and housing units under management by the tribe or designated entity.
""Every family, every community in America, deserves the chance to flourish,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""Tribes use this funding to build new homes, or to solve their most pressing housing issues. Our partnerships with tribal communities and leaders are critical today to help ensure better housing, neighborhoods and economic opportunities for tomorrow.""
Eligible activities for the funds include housing development, assistance to housing developed under the Indian Housing Program of the 1937 Housing Act, housing services to eligible families and individuals, housing management services, crime prevention and safety, and model activities that provide creative approaches to solving affordable housing problems. The block grant approach to housing was enabled by the Native American Housing Assistance and Self Determination Act of 1996 (NAHASDA).
""The Indian Housing Block Grant program is the single, largest source of affordable housing assistance in Native American communities,"" said HUD Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary Lourdes Castro Ramírez. ""Over the life of the program, recipients have been able to build or acquire almost 37,000 affordable homes and have rehabilitated more than 77,000 housing units.""
HUD's proposed Fiscal Year 2017 Budget seeks $700 million for Native American Housing Block Grants, $50 million above the 2016 enacted level, to address severe overcrowding and substandard housing conditions in Indian Country. An additional $20 million in Indian Community Development Block Grant funding is being requested for projects to improve outcomes for Native youth, such as the construction or renovation of community centers, health clinics, transitional housing, pre-school/Head Start facilities and teacher housing. And up to $5 million in Jobs-Plus funding will be used to implement a demonstration of the program in Indian Country to boost employment and earnings."
02/17/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-020.cfm,HUD Secretary Julián Castro to Begin Prosperity Playbook Community Tour,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Julián Castro launched the ""Prosperity Playbook"" community tour today in Kansas City, MO. The ""Prosperity Playbook"" will be a compilation of online resources written for and by state and local decision makers. This online toolkit will inform community planning and help local leaders think regionally about how to expand affordable housing opportunity and forge greater economic mobility in communities across the nation. Through the ""Prosperity Playbook"" engagement sessions Secretary Castro and HUD are engaging in the pressing conversation about how to create economic opportunity for everyone to have the chance to succeed.
""In too many communities across our great nation a child's zip code determines how far they can go in life and what they will achieve,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""Creating inclusive communities is not always popular and forces us to have difficult conversations about our nation's most challenging unresolved issues of class, race and discrimination. Through these engagement sessions we hope to extract the best ideas from communities already doing great work, share these findings and lift up other communities in their efforts to increase mobility for our nation's most vulnerable citizens.""
The ""Prosperity Playbook"" will not be a federal mandate or plan. It will be a collection of the best ideas from a cross section of local leaders who are committed to working regionally to solve some of the most difficult issues facing communities across the country. In the coming weeks, Secretary Castro will travel to the initial five contributing communities of Kansas City, MO, Denver, CO, San Francisco, CA, Atlanta, GA and Minneapolis, MN.
During the sessions, Secretary Castro will be highlighting the work of local leaders in leading regional efforts to expand access to opportunity.
A recent Harvard study (http://economics.harvard.edu/news/new-research-mobility-studies-profs-chetty-hendren-and-katz) showed that a low-income boy growing up in Baltimore will earn roughly 25 percent less than a similar child growing up in higher-opportunity community. One of the most striking findings was the 18-year gap in life expectancy in Missouri between the Clayton zip code of 63105 (85 years) and the Jeff-Vander-Lou neighborhood zip code of 63106 in North St. Louis (67 years). Findings from the study support a balanced approach of empowering economic mobility while also reinvesting in and developing access to opportunity in neighborhoods.
Following the engagement tour, each contributing community will create a regional blueprint outlining best practices and ideas to tackle the specific challenges facing their local communities in creating more inclusive communities. In the fall, HUD will use the regional blueprints to inform the ""Prosperity Playbook"" toolkit, which will be made available online. This will be a new online resource for state and local leaders and other stakeholders to use for community planning and development."

EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take two months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, 4 months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2%) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90-percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised about three percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found on our web site listed above.
* 90% confidence interval includes zero. The Census Bureau does not have sufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero.

02/19/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-022.cfm,HUD Makes $40 Million Available for Housing Counseling Grants,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced it is making $40 million in grants available to support hundreds of housing counseling organizations across the country that assist families, including those buying their first home, struggling to locate affordable rental housing or seeking to avoid foreclosure. It is estimated HUD's housing counseling grants, and the additional funding they leverage, will reach more than 1.5 million households through a network of approximately 300 national, regional and local organizations. See HUD's new funding announcement (www.grants.gov/view-opportunity.html?oppId=281614).
""We know that housing counseling can make all the difference in purchasing and, most importantly, keeping a home,"" HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""The grants we offer today will help ensure families and individuals make more informed housing decisions, whether it means buying their first home, avoiding foreclosure, or finding affordable rental housing.""
HUD is offering $40 million to directly support the housing counseling services provided by national and regional organizations, multi-state organizations, State Housing Finance Agencies (SHFAs) and more than 200 local housing counseling agencies that assist low- and moderate-income families improve their housing conditions. Grant winners use the money to help homebuyers evaluate if they are ready to buy a house, understand their financing and down payment options, and navigate what can be an extremely confusing and difficult process. Grantees also help families find affordable rental housing and offer financial literacy training to help struggling families repair credit problems.
The comprehensive housing counseling housing grants funding announced today will be competed through the Department's two-year (FY2016 - FY2017) Comprehensive Housing Counseling Grant Program Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) published February 18, 2016. The application deadline is April 4, 2016.
In addition, HUD is also making $2 million available in FY2016-2017 Housing Counseling Training Grant Program funds to support basic and specialized housing counseling training for housing counseling agencies. The application deadline is April 4, 2016. Read the housing counseling training fund announcement here (www.grants.gov/search-grants.html?agencies%3DHUD%7CDepartment%20of%20Housing%20and%20Urban%20Development).
The national and regional agencies distribute much of the housing counseling grant funding to the community-based organizations. The larger organizations also help guide and improve the quality of housing counseling services and enhance coordination among counseling providers.
In addition to providing counseling to homeowners and renters, the organizations assist homeless persons in finding the transitional housing they need to move toward a permanent place to live. Grantees also assist senior citizens seeking reverse mortgages or (HECM,) providing counseling for the rapidly growing number of elderly homeowners who want to convert equity in their homes into income that can be used to pay for home improvements, medical costs, and other living expenses.
Housing counseling agencies also support fair housing by assisting borrowers in reviewing their loan documentation to avoid potential mortgage scams, unreasonably high interest rates, inflated appraisals, unaffordable repayment terms, and other conditions that can result in a loss of equity, increased debt, default, and even foreclosure. Likewise, foreclosure prevention counseling helps homeowners facing delinquency or default employ strategies, including expense reduction, negotiation with lenders and loan servicers, and loss mitigation, to avoid foreclosure.
Recent research from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and the Urban Institute continues to find substantial benefits to housing counseling for families who purchase their first homes and those struggling to prevent foreclosure. Read more about research evidence on the role housing counseling can play in reducing mortgage delinquency and foreclosure and helping first-time buyers access and sustain homeownership.

02/22/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-023.cfm,HUD Takes Possession of Alexander County Housing Authority,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced that it is immediately taking possession of the Alexander County (IL) Housing Authority (ACHA). HUD is taking this action following a years-long pattern of financial and operational mismanagement, poor housing conditions, and alleged civil rights violations against the households the local housing authority was responsible for assisting. Read HUD's letter to ACHA's board chairman Andy Clarke.
As an initial enforcement step, HUD is assigning two of its experienced public housing administrators to assume day-to-day control of the housing agency, effective today. These HUD administrators will have oversight responsibility of ACHA, and will serve as its two-member board of directors. This will be a seamless transition and HUD will communicate directly with ACHA residents and employees in the coming days. Read HUD's notice to tenants.
Lourdes Castro Ramírez, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for HUD's Office of Public and Indian Housing, said, ""This immediate and prudent action is to ensure the health, safety and wellbeing of the families residing in ACHA communities. We came to this decision as a result of ACHA's failure to demonstrate substantial improvement in the physical, financial, operational and governance issues identified by HUD in 2013.""
ACHA entered into a contract with HUD on September 5, 1972, to provide public housing to qualified households. While ACHA has 494 public housing units in its inventory, HUD's recent reviews of vacant and occupied units found unacceptable living conditions, including evidence of roach infestations, mold, electrical and plumbing issues, and non-functioning appliances. HUD conducted multiple reviews since September 2013 and issued numerous findings related to the poor housing conditions. Despite multiple efforts by HUD to have the ACHA remedy these deficiencies, ACHA took little or no corrective action, thus presenting an emergency and immediate threat to the health and safety of the tenants.
In addition, ACHA entered into a voluntary agreement with HUD in August of 2015 to address several civil rights findings made by HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. On January 21, 2016, HUD issued a letter to ACHA noting that it is in violation of its civil rights requirements and the terms of the Voluntary Compliance Agreement, and required a Designated Housing Plan addressing the wait list, maintenance employee assignments and pay, lease enforcement, and employment of a permanent Executive Director.
Because ACHA failed to resolve its systemic operational problems, lacks effective leadership and is in default of its obligations under HUD regulations, the Annual Contributions Contract (HUD grant agreement with ACHA), and Federal statutes, HUD declared ACHA in substantial default of these obligations. HUD will exercise all rights and options available under the ACC, Federal statutes and HUD regulations. As an initial step and effective February 22, 2016, the ACHA Board of Commissioners and its individual members are removed and relieved of their duties as commissioners."

In April, one team from among these graduate student finalists will be chosen as the overall winner for having the best solution to redevelop the Monteria Village public housing development in Santa Barbara, California.
The design competition also seeks to improve capacity for industry professionals and future designers and planners, and to foster cross-cutting team-work within the design and community development process.
""Boosting and improving affordable housing is critical to the mission of HUD and to ensuring that every American has access to safe and stable housing,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""By tapping the talents of top young people across the nation, we are finding new ways to tackle old challenges in federal government.""
HUD and the Housing Authority in the City of Santa Barbara, California challenged multi-disciplinary teams of graduate students to consider the complex challenges associated with rehabbing the current structure or demolishing it and creating new construction. These student participants needed to consider design, community development, and financing elements in order to provide an all-encompassing plan and solution that would allow the housing authority to meet its goal of offering safe and sustainable affordable housing to area families. Students also needed to understand the needs of the intended residents, the zoning restrictions, and leveraging opportunities.
The four finalist teams are (https://www.huduser.gov/portal/challenge/home.html):
University of Texas at Austin - Team members Sarah Simpson, Brett Clark, Megan Recher, and Tatum Law put forth plans for a revitalized development. This redesigned community in Monteria adds 39 units for a total of 67 renovated homes, adding density and providing housing opportunities for very low-income families. It accommodates a centralized Family Opportunity Center, an Education Center, and improves the water infiltration and capture on site. University of Kansas - Team members Ryan Lyssy, Katie Beckwith, Doug Dawson, Culin Thompson, and Colin Thomas proposed a health and wellness ""Living Lab"" that provides residents of all ages requiring access to a variety of healthcare services. The centerpiece of this facility is to accommodate seniors who wish to remain with their families as they age and require increasing levels of physical, emotional, and mental care. Harvard University - Team members Alyson Stein, Omar Carrillo Tinajero, Miriam Keller, and Justin Kollar designed a 34-unit new construction development which features a family-centered sustainable design that can accommodate all types of families. It includes an Opportunity Center that provides flexible recreational and communal space, a new community garden, and offers activities for families, children and seniors. University of Maryland at College Park (UMCP) - Team members Meghan Leahy, Oluwatobi Thomas, Nicole Akpedeye, David Brotman, and Robert Grooms created a new construction development which includes 48 affordable housing units within 19 three-story town houses, 14 two-story townhouses, and a four-story multifamily development that includes a food co-op, a community center, and easy access to a community garden nearby.

02/29/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-028.cfm,HUD And First Federal Bank of Kansas City Reach $2.8 Million Settlement,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today an agreement with First Federal Bank of Kansas City to resolve allegations of 'redlining' against African American mortgage applicants. Two fair housing organizations claimed the lender's designated service area effectively excluded African American neighborhoods, limiting residential mortgage lending to persons based upon their race. Read the HUD-mediated agreement announced today.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful for any person or other entity whose business includes residential real estate-related transactions to discriminate against any person because of race.
""Homeownership should never be affected by the color of a person's skin. This agreement helps to ensure that all qualified families in the Kansas City area get a fair shot at owning their own home, regardless of race,"" said HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity Gustavo Velasquez. ""HUD will continue to work with banks across the nation to ensure they follow the Fair Housing Act.""
The agreement stems from two complaints filed on October 5, 2015, by the nonprofit organizations Metropolitan St. Louis Equal Housing and Opportunity Council (EHOC) and Legal Aid of Western Missouri. The groups alleged the bank's lack of market penetration in African-American communities in the urban core (East Side) of Kansas City, Missouri made residential real estate products less available to people based on race. The groups also alleged that the bank designated its service area, or assessment area, in a way that excluded areas of high African American concentration, which resulted in making residential real estate products less available to persons based on race, a practice commonly known as redlining.
As part of the HUD-mediated conciliation agreement, First Federal Bank of Kansas City agreed to provide $75,000 in discounts or subsidies on home purchase loans on owner-occupied properties in majority African American census tracts in the Kansas City metropolitan area over a three year period. In addition, the bank agreed to originate $2.5 million in mortgage loans in majority African American neighborhoods over a three year period.
The bank also agreed to a series of important fair lending directed financial commitments:
$105,000 to support a loan pool that finances the rehabilitation of vacant, blighted homes in distressed areas of Kansas City; $50,000 at the rate of at least $15,000 per year for three consecutive years for affirmative marketing and outreach to African American communities in the Kansas City metropolitan area; $30,000 to support financial education specifically targeting majority African American communities; $50,000 directly to the named complainants to support their fair lending and community reinvestment work.

03/01/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-029.cfm,HUD Streamlines Rent Regulations,"WASHINGTON - In an effort to reduce the administrative burden on state and local governments, public housing authorities and private owners of HUD-assisted multifamily properties, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today posted on its website for advanced review a forthcoming new rule to ease its regulatory requirements under a number of the Department's programs. The new rule is intended to streamline a host of requirements and to provide greater flexibility for agencies responsible for administering HUD's rental assistance programs. Read HUD's new rule.
""This rule provides a number of much-needed flexibilities that will enable public housing agencies and other housing administrators to operate their programs more efficiently and effectively,"" said Lourdes Castro Ramirez, HUD's Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing. ""We will continue to explore other areas to reduce administrative burden while ensuring grantees' ability to provide housing assistance to low-income families in communities across the nation.""
The changes included in this rule, while important, should be considered an initial step towards more systematic streamlining of HUD's rental assistance programs. HUD recognizes that its partners are struggling to operate their programs in a difficult budget environment and intends to continue reexamining program requirements in order to find ways to eliminate unnecessary requirements and improve efficiency.
The new streamlined rule applies to local housing agencies administering Public Housing and the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) programs as well as private landlords under contract through HUD's Multifamily Housing Programs. In addition, the rule relaxes regulations on state and local units of government administering tenant-based rental assistance programs through HUD's HOME Investment Partnerships Program and Housing Opportunities for Person with AIDS (HOPWA) Program.
HUD's new rule will impact tenant rental payments, rent determination processes, verification of Social Security Numbers for children of applicants, frequency of utility reimbursement payments, verification of assets and community service completion, grievance procedures, unit inspections, and utility payment schedules."
03/08/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-030.cfm,HUD Awards $1.6 Billion for Local Homeless Programs,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Julián Castro today awarded $1.6 billion in grants to provide funding to 6,400 local homeless housing and service programs across the U.S., Puerto Rico, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands. View a complete list of all the state and local homeless projects awarded funding on HUD's website.
The Tier 1 Continuum of Care (CoC) grants announced today support the Obama Administration's efforts to end homelessness by providing critically needed housing and support services to individuals and families experiencing homelessness. HUD will award approximately $300 million in ""Tier 2 grants"" in the spring to support hundreds more local programs.
""A safe, stable home is the foundation for opportunity in all of our lives,"" said Secretary Castro. ""That's why we're continuing to challenge communities to deploy proven strategies to help people experiencing homelessness find a place to call home. Through unprecedented partnership among every level of government and private, non-profit and philanthropic organizations, we know this goal is not just aspirational - it's achievable.""
""More than 20 communities and two entire states have leveraged the leadership of their continuums of care to build systems that have ended homelessness among our nation's veterans,"" said Matthew Doherty, executive director of the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness. ""Working together with state and local leaders, CoCs continue to prove that a combination of the right strategies, enough resources, and urgent action can end homelessness in America for everyone.""
This year's grants are being awarded in the most competitive environment HUD has experienced in the Continuum of Care grant program. To compete most effectively, communities made very challenging decisions, often shifting funds from existing projects to create new ones that will have a more substantial and lasting impact on homeless populations.
In 2010, President Obama and 19 federal agencies and offices that form the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH) launched the nation's first-ever comprehensive strategy to prevent and end homelessness. Opening Doors: Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness (www.usich.gov/opening_doors/) puts the country on a path to end veterans and chronic homelessness as well as to end homelessness among children, family, and youth.
HUD estimates there were 564,708 persons experiencing homelessness on a single night in 2015. Since 2010 local communities around the country reported a declined by more than 72,000 persons, an 11 percent reduction. In addition, veteran homelessness fell by 36 percent, chronic homelessness declined 22 percent and between 2010 and January 2015, family homelessness declined by 19 percent, while the estimated number of unaccompanied homeless youth and children was 36,097.
Across the nation, local homelessness planning agencies called 'Continuums of Care' recently organized volunteers to help count the number of persons located in emergency shelters, transitional housing programs and living unsheltered on the streets. Continuums of Care will report these one-night 'point-in-time counts' later in the year and will form the basis of HUD's 2016 national homeless estimate."

See list of funding by states below.
The funding, provided through HUD's Resident Opportunities and Self Sufficiency - Service Coordinators Program (ROSS-SC) helps public housing authorities, resident associations, non-profit organizations, Indian tribes or entities representing Indian tribes hire or retain ""service coordinators"" who work directly with residents to assess their needs and connect them with education, job training and placement programs, and/or computer and financial literacy services available in their community to promote self-sufficiency.
""Today, we make an affirmative investment in families living in public housing to help them build a brighter future for themselves and their children,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""This funding allows our local partners to support residents' goals and put them on the path toward self-sufficiency.""
The purpose of HUD's ROSS-SC program is to encourage local, innovative strategies that link public housing assistance with public and private resources to enable participating families to increase earned income; reduce or eliminate the need for welfare assistance; and make progress toward achieving economic independence and housing self-sufficiency."

The settlement will serve as a catalyst to promote housing mobility and to assist the County and its surrounding areas in developing comprehensive affordable housing planning and strategies that address residential segregation.
The groundbreaking agreement commits $30 million over 10 years to develop at least 1,000 affordable housing units for low- and very low-income residents. In addition, the County will provide 2,000 Housing Choice Vouchers through a housing mobility program to assist families to gain access to higher opportunity neighborhoods. At least one-third of the affordable units created under the agreement will be accessible and made available to people with disabilities. The agreement also calls for the introduction of a county ordinance that would support source of income legislation. Read the full agreement.
Today's agreement is the result of a complaint filed with HUD in November 2011 by the Baltimore County Branch of the NAACP, Baltimore Neighborhoods, Inc., a private non-profit fair housing organization, and three individuals, claiming that the County: 1) had not developed affordable housing in areas other than those that were concentrated by race and poverty; 2) focused only on providing rental housing for seniors rather than families; 3) adequate numbers of accessible units were unavailable to people with disabilities; and 4) its actions had failed to affirmatively further fair housing.
""Every person deserves a fair shot at opportunity and that starts with a decent, safe, and affordable place to call home,"" said Secretary Julián Castro. ""This agreement sets Baltimore County on a path to stronger, more inclusive communities where everyone can enjoy equal access to opportunity. Many thanks to all involved for coming together to expand housing choice in the County.""
Under the terms of the agreement announced today, Baltimore County will:
Invest $3 million annually for 10 years to create 1,000 affordable housing units through new construction or rehabilitation. The units will be geographically dispersed in neighborhoods that provide access to opportunity. At least 500 of the units will have three or more bedrooms to accommodate families with children and atleast one-third of the units will be accessible and made available to people with disabilities.

New Residential Construction data for March 2016 will be released on Tuesday, April 19, 2016, at 8:30 A.M. EDT.
EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take two months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, 4 months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2%) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90-percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised about three percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found on our web site listed above.
* 90% confidence interval includes zero. The Census Bureau does not have sufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero.

03/18/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-034.cfm,HUD Offers Over $100 Million in Grants to Clean up Lead and Other Housing-Related Health Hazards,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today announced that it is making more than $100 million in grants available to help eliminate dangerous lead-based paint hazards from the homes of lower income families. These grants are intended to protect young children from lead poisoning and provide an opportunity for states and local communities to establish programs to control health and safety hazards by assessing and remediating lead-based paint and other housing related health hazards.
HUD Secretary Julián Castro is focused on advancing policies that create opportunities for all Americans, including helping children and families secure quality housing by protecting them from the hazards of lead-based paint and other home health and safety hazards.
""Since 1973, HUD has been leading the charge in lead hazard identification and abatement throughout the housing industry. We know that there's no more important mission than to protect our children and give them the greatest opportunity in their lives. These important grants will help keep thousands of children safe and healthy, free of debilitating lead poisoning.""
Unsafe and unhealthy homes affect the health of millions of people of all income levels, geographic areas, and walks of life in the U.S. These conditions affect the economy directly, through increased utilization of health care services, and indirectly, through lost wages and increased school days missed. The housing improvements that communities make using these grants will help prevent illnesses and injuries, reduce associated health care and social services costs, reduce absentee rates for children in school and adults at work, and reduce stress, all which help to improve the quality of life.
HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes promotes local efforts to eliminate dangerous lead paint and other housing-related health and safety hazards from lower income homes, stimulate private sector investment in lead hazard control, support cutting-edge research on methods for assessing and controlling housing-related health and safety hazards, and educate the public about the dangers of hazards in the home.
The grants to States and local governments are being offered through HUD's Lead-Based Paint Hazard Control Program totaling $43 million, and its Lead Hazard Reduction Demonstration Program, totaling $45 million. In these grant programs, HUD is providing nearly $13 million in healthy homes supplemental funds to promote identify and remediate additional housing related health hazards in homes with lead based paint hazards."

HUD alleged that the Salwasser Group, Inc. (doing business as Income Property Specialists) and property owners Gary and Mary Drieger discriminated against prospective renters by refusing to accept Mexican forms of identification, while encouraging a Canadian passport holder to apply for an apartment.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in rental, sales or home lending transactions based on a person's national origin. This includes discrimination based on a person's ancestry or country of birth outside the United States.
""Where a person is from should not influence the housing options that are available to them,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""The Fair Housing Act requires property owners to treat everyone equally and HUD will continue to take action when they fail to meet that obligation.""
The case came to HUD's attention when Project Sentinel, a fair housing organization based in Santa Clara, filed a complaint after performing fair housing testing that allegedly showed that the owners, through the management company, discriminated on the basis of national origin by refusing to rent, and imposing different terms and conditions regarding government-issued forms of identification.
According to Project Sentinel's complaint, the respondents allegedly informed testers who offered a Mexican passport and a Mexican consular identification that such identification would not be accepted, but encouraged testers using a Canadian passport to apply.
Under the Conciliation Agreement, the owners and management company agreed to pay Project Sentinel a monetary settlement; obtain fair housing training on how not to discriminate; and implement a HUD-approved non-discrimination policy. The owners and manager also agreed to implement a HUD-approved procedure for accepting government-issued forms of identification and post a HUD-approved fair housing poster in the public area of its rental property.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY).

This is 2.0 percent (±18.8%)* above the revised January rate of 502,000 and is 6.1 percent (±17.9%)* below the February 2015 estimate of 545,000.
The median sales price of new houses sold in February 2016 was $301,400; the average sales price was $348,900. The seasonally adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of February was 240,000. This represents a supply of 5.6 months at the current sales rate.
Estimates of houses sold and for sale by stage of construction are now available on a seasonally adjusted basis as well as not seasonally adjusted basis. Historic seasonally adjusted data will be available back to January 1999 at http://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/historical_data/.

Eligibility for Internet Essentials (https://www.internetessentials.com/), Comcast's high-speed Internet adoption program, will be immediately extended to public housing residents in Miami-Dade County and the cities of Nashville, Philadelphia, and Seattle. This is the eighth time in five years Comcast has expanded eligibility for Internet Essentials.
HUD Secretary Julián Castro and Comcast Corporation Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Diversity Officer David L. Cohen made today's announcements alongside Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos A. Giménez and City of Miami Mayor Tomás Regalado at Rainbow Village, a public housing development in Miami, Florida. At the event, Comcast technicians were on hand to install Internet service on the spot and provided a free laptop computer and six months' worth of complimentary Internet Essentials Internet service to every Rainbow Village household. The company also donated 15 new computers to the Rainbow Village computer lab where digital literacy training sessions take place after school and where students can do homework and adults can get online.
""ConnectHome is expanding opportunity for the next generation, preparing them for success in the 21st century,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""Comcast's decision to join the ConnectHome initiative boosts our continued efforts to close the digital divide. Through their commitment and all of our committed stakeholders, public and private, we're leveling the playing field for public housing residents across the nation and opening doors to prosperity that otherwise would remain closed.""
""Internet access at home is essential to succeed in today's digital world on all fronts, from employment to education. Unfortunately, a cruel irony is at work, as the majority of low-income families, including those in public housing, who truly need the transformative power of the Internet are not connected,"" said David L. Cohen. ""Comcast's collaboration with ConnectHome will not only build a bridge for those living in public housing to cross the digital divide, but the Internet also gives them a ladder to educational and vocational resources that can improve the quality of their lives and help them claim their American dream.""
About ConnectHome
Building on the Obama Administration's goal to expand high speed broadband to all Americans, in July 2015, President Obama and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Julián Castro announced, ConnectHome (http://connecthome.hud.gov/), an initiative to extend affordable broadband access to families living in HUD-assisted housing. Through ConnectHome, Internet Service Providers, non-profits and the private sector are offering broadband access, technical training, digital literacy programs, and devices for residents in assisted housing units in 28 communities across the nation. ConnectHome creates a platform to help ensure that students have access to high-speed Internet for studying and doing their homework at home, as well as in school. For more information on all ConnectHome communities please visit ConnectHome.hud.gov.
Between 2009 and 2014, broadband service providers spent over $422 billion on capital investments, and three in four American households now use broadband at home. Despite this significant progress, one in four American households still don't access the Internet at home, particularly lower-income families with children. While nearly two-thirds of America's lowest-income households own a computer, less than half have a home Internet subscription. HUD's ConnectHome initiative strives to ensure that students can access the same level of high-speed Internet at home that they possess in their classrooms.
Comcast is the first new Internet service provider to join the ConnectHome initiative, launched in July 2015. While the 28 ConnectHome communities will remain as part of the initial pilot, additional communities like Miami-Dade are part of ConnectHome's larger vision to close the digital divide and bring broadband access to every public housing resident in the nation.
Today's announcement marks the eighth time in five years Comcast has expanded eligibility for the program, which underscores the company's commitment to addressing the digital divide. Originally, Internet Essentials was offered to families with children eligible to receive a free school lunch from the National School Lunch Program. It was first expanded to children also eligible for the reduced price school lunch program. Comcast then expanded eligibility to include families with children in parochial, private, charter, and cyber schools, as well as students who are home schooled. Last year, Comcast extended the program two more times, on a pilot basis, to low-income seniors and low-income community college students. In addition, Comcast has expanded the number of schools where every student in the school will be deemed eligible for the program so long as a certain percentage of the kids in that school are NSLP eligible - from 70 percent, to 50 percent, and now to 40 percent. As a result, Comcast estimates auto-enrollment now applies to about half of the 48,000 schools across its service area.
Also today, Comcast announced its latest Internet Essentials milestones. In less than five years, the program has now connected more than 600,000 low-income families, benefitting more than 2.4 million Americans, to the Internet at home. In fact, 2015 was the program's single most successful year ever, with a 30 percent increase in enrollments over 2014.
Internet Essentials includes download Internet speeds up to 10 Mbps, a free Wi-Fi router, access to free digital literacy training, and the option to purchase a computer for less than $150. Public housing residents in the four pilot markets (Miami-Dade County and the cities of Nashville, Philadelphia, Seattle) are eligible to apply, regardless of whether they have a child in the National School Lunch Program or not. To apply, visit www.InternetEssentials.com or call 1-855-846-8376.
Internet Essentials Key Investments

Jointly presented by HUD and APA, the HUD Secretary's Award recognizes a plan, program, or project that has been in effect for at least three years and improves the quality of life for low- and moderate-income community residents. Emphasis is placed on how creative housing, economic development and private investments have been used in or with a comprehensive community development plan to empower a community.
Differing from other approaches, the Homeless Solutions 10-Year Plan changed the approach from 'managing' to ending chronic homelessness. The plan is a result of two years of work and the involvement of approximately 200 people representing consumers, providers, neighborhood groups, government jurisdictions, philanthropy, business, nonprofits, education, housing and the faith community.
The plan is data-driven and based on best practice models providing a creative, coordinated and collaborative approach to tackling the moral and economic challenges of homelessness. Four key principles are identified within the plan: poverty reduction, housing, prevention, and multi-system response. The plan has changed the shape of the homeless assistance system in Dayton and Montgomery County.
""Congratulations to the City of Dayton and Montgomery County, Ohio for developing a plan to effectively end chronic homelessness,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""The team's focus on homelessness is exemplary, and their innovation and commitment will help transform people's lives for the better.""
""Since the plan was adopted, chronic homelessness in Montgomery County has been reduced more than 50 percent with almost 600 new permanent supportive housing units created for young adults, single adults and families,"" said Kathy Werkmeister, president of the Ohio Conference of Community Development. ""Additionally, the community created a coordinated effort by all area agencies serving the homeless while eliminating duplicate services and making core services more efficient and effective.""
Prior to adoption of the plan, the homeless 'system' was more of a collection of dedicated providers who individually stepped up to fill the need. Now there is a cohesive, coordinated homeless system implementing a set of agreed upon community strategies. The Homeless Solutions 10-Year Plan has changed the shape of the homeless assistance system in Dayton and Montgomery County. The community has already witnessed a dramatic decrease in the number of people experiencing chronic homelessness - 79 percent since 2005.
The plan has been formally adopted by the City of Dayton, Montgomery County, and the United Way of the Greater Dayton area. The plan has also been used as a model to shape other community initiatives on substance abuse, ex-offender reentry and poverty reduction.
""Dayton and Montgomery County have created a national framework for communities looking to solve homelessness once and for all,"" said W. Shedrick Coleman, APA 2016 Awards Jury chair. ""By working together, the community proves that we can create communities of lasting value.""
The 2016 APA National Planning Award recipients will be honored at a special luncheon on April 4, 2016, during the APA National Planning Conference in Phoenix, Arizona. The award winners will also be featured in the April 2016 issue of Planning magazine.

APA's national awards program, the profession's highest honor, is a proud tradition established more than 50 years ago to recognize outstanding community plans, planning programs and initiatives, public education efforts, and individuals for their leadership on planning issues."
03/31/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-039.cfm,Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) Reaches $2 Billion Milestone,"WASHINGTON - Three years after its launch, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) has generated $2 billion in private investment to make critically needed repairs and improvements to more than 30,000 units of former public housing. Under the RAD model, public housing authorities and owners of other HUD-supported properties can access private financing to rehabilitate and preserve existing affordable housing while expanding opportunity in communities across the nation.
RAD is helping to address the capital backlog in the public housing program through private sector leveraging without increasing costs to the taxpayer. Each year, roughly 10,000 units of public housing are lost due to disrepair - a supply-side crisis that's compounded by increasing demand for quality affordable housing. Today, more than a quarter of all renters are paying at least half of their income just to keep a roof over their families' heads. By stemming the tide of these lost units, RAD helps ensure more low-income residents are able to secure a quality affordable home.
""Our RAD initiative is an innovative option for housing authorities looking to keep pace with their capital needs in this challenging budget climate,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""Crossing the $2 billion mark represents the critical need to maintain and expand affordable housing stock to expand opportunity for more Americans seeking a quality and affordable place to live.""
The process of converting deteriorating public housing to a project-based Section 8 model under RAD is proving to be a versatile tool for PHAs to preserve affordable housing, to serve more eligible households, and maximize the impact of scarce federal resources. While most conversions involve the modernization and stabilization of existing properties, in 17 percent of completed RAD conversions, PHAs have been able to demolish distressed properties and replace them with new, permanently affordable housing. In 30 conversions, PHAs converted and moved the assistance out of blighted or isolated locations and into neighborhoods of greater opportunity.
For example, in Lexington, Kentucky, Centre Meadows was of one of the first RAD transactions to close with a Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insured mortgage. The 206-unit apartment complex is currently undergoing substantial rehabilitation by the Lexington Housing Authority (LHA) involving 11 buildings. Centre Meadows was developed in the early 1970s in the southeastern portion of the city. The property had significant capital needs and LHA's Capital Funds were insufficient to meet those needs. This project was in such deteriorated shape that at the time of the RAD application, it was thought to be housing of last resort for people who had no other housing options. Without RAD, it was likely that the project would be demolished.
In North Carolina, the Lexington Housing Authority (LHA) converted all 268 units of its public housing units that faced persistent cutbacks in LHA's Capital Fund program and an extensive capital needs backlog, estimated at over $41,000 per unit in hard construction costs. RAD presented the LHA a way to raise private debt and equity necessary to finance these substantial repairs and allow the housing authority to leverage public and private sources of capital totaling more than $67,000 per unit which covered all construction costs needed to carry its affordable housing projects through the next 20 years.
Located in DeKalb County, Georgia, Tobie Grant Manor was built in the late 1960s and became functionally obsolete by 2013. Concrete walls, small rooms, and tiny closets made the buildings feel extremely outdated and expensive to maintain. RAD allowed the Housing Authority of DeKalb County to access outside capital to rehabilitate and rebuild their properties, providing long-term financial stability needed to maintain, preserve, and even add units. In addition to the equity brought in through Federal and state tax credits, this project was made feasible with conventional mortgages and federal HOME funds allocated by the state of Georgia. The conversion doubles the number of units at Tobie Grant, and financially positions HADC favorably for future redevelopments.
HUD has made awards to PHAs across the country for all of the 185,000 units currently authorized to participate in RAD and estimates over $6 billion in new, largely privately funded construction investments will be made in the public housing units currently authorized to participate in RAD. With a waiting list of new applicants forming, HUD has asked Congress to eliminate the current cap of 185,000 units so that any public housing property that can be preserved and improved through RAD is eligible."
03/31/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-040.cfm,HUD Issues Final Rule Extending Religious Liberty Protections to Beneficiaries of HUD Programs and Activities,"WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) published a final rule that provides new religious liberty protections for beneficiaries of its programs and activities. In addition, HUD's new rule ensures that faith-based providers can compete for government funds on the same basis as any other private organization. Read more (https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2016/04/04/2016-07339/fundamental-principles-and-policymaking-criteria-for-partnerships-with-faith-based-and-other).
For example, the beneficiary of child care carried out by a faith-based organization with direct HUD funds under the Department's Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program must be notified in writing that he or she cannot be discriminated against based on religion; cannot be required to attend or participate in any privately funded religious activities that are offered separate from the CDBG-funded program or activities; and may request an alternative provider if the beneficiary objects to the religious character of the organization. At the same time, the regulations require that all decisions about Federal financial assistance be based solely on merit, without regard to an organization's religious character, affiliation or lack thereof. The regulations formally implement Executive Order 13559. Other Federal agencies are also publishing final regulations that apply to programs and activities that they fund.
""These regulations build on widespread agreement that we can and should do more to protect the religious liberty of beneficiaries and provide greater clarity and transparency about applicable church-state rules,"" said Melissa Rogers, Executive Director of the White House Office of Faith-based and Neighborhood Partnerships. ""These reforms will strengthen partnerships that serve people in need, and we commend the agencies for working together to issue these final regulations.""
HUD Secretary Julián Castro added, ""These new regulations strengthen religious liberty protections for beneficiaries across HUD programs and help eligible faith-based applicants to compete for HUD funding on an equal footing. As HUD seeks to help build ladders of opportunity for all Americans, these new protections benefit both grantees and beneficiaries.""
HUD's final regulations:
Require that all decisions about awards of Federal financial assistance are based solely on merit, without regard to an organization's religious character or affiliation or lack thereof, and are free from political interference, or the appearance of such interference. Make clear that faith-based organizations are eligible to participate in HUD programs and activities on the same basis as any other organization. Clarify what activities can and cannot be supported with direct Federal financial assistance by replacing use of the term ""inherently religious activities"" with the term ""explicitly religious activities"" and providing examples of such activities. Prohibit organizations that receive Federal financial assistance under a HUD program or activity from discriminating against beneficiaries or prospective beneficiaries on the basis of religion, a religious belief, a refusal to hold a religious belief, or a refusal to attend or participate in a religious practice, in providing services or carrying out activities with such assistance. Require faith-based organizations that carry out program or activities with direct Federal financial assistance from HUD to provide written notice of certain protections to beneficiaries and prospective beneficiaries of the programs or activities. Specifically, an organization that receives direct Federal financial assistance is required to give notice to beneficiaries and prospective beneficiaries that—
• Require that all decisions about awards of Federal financial assistance are based solely on merit, without regard to an organization's religious character or affiliation or lack thereof, and are free from political interference, or the appearance of such interference.
• Make clear that faith-based organizations are eligible to participate in HUD programs and activities on the same basis as any other organization.
• Clarify what activities can and cannot be supported with direct Federal financial assistance by replacing use of the term ""inherently religious activities"" with the term ""explicitly religious activities"" and providing examples of such activities.
• Prohibit organizations that receive Federal financial assistance under a HUD program or activity from discriminating against beneficiaries or prospective beneficiaries on the basis of religion, a religious belief, a refusal to hold a religious belief, or a refusal to attend or participate in a religious practice, in providing services or carrying out activities with such assistance.
• Require faith-based organizations that carry out program or activities with direct Federal financial assistance from HUD to provide written notice of certain protections to beneficiaries and prospective beneficiaries of the programs or activities. Specifically, an organization that receives direct Federal financial assistance is required to give notice to beneficiaries and prospective beneficiaries that—
• The organization may not discriminate against a beneficiary or prospective beneficiary based on religion, a religious belief, a refusal to hold a religious belief, or a refusal to attend or participate in a religious practice;
• The organization may not require a beneficiary to attend or participate in any explicitly religious activities that are offered by the organization, and any participation by the beneficiaries in those activities must be purely voluntary;
• The organization must separate in time or location any privately funded explicitly religious activities from activities supported by direct Federal financial assistance;
• If a beneficiary or prospective beneficiary objects to the religious character of the organization, the organization will undertake reasonable efforts to identify and refer the beneficiary to an alternative provider to which the beneficiary has no such objection; and
• A beneficiary or prospective beneficiary may report violations of these protections, including any denials of services or benefits, to the Federal agency or intermediary administering the program.
While these regulations become effective 30 days after publication in the Federal Register, recipients of Federal financial assistance will have 90 days to comply with the final regulations.

04/01/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-041.cfm,HUD Kicks Off Fair Housing Month 2016 by Launching National Media Campaign that Depicts Shared Opportunity for All,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today kicked off Fair Housing Month 2016 with the launch of a new national media campaign that helps the public to envision what communities with shared opportunity for all might look like. The new campaign is designed to further educate the public about their housing rights and the ideals behind HUD's new Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing (AFFH) initiative.
The campaign, which was developed in partnership with the National Fair Housing Alliance (NFHA), will include print Public Service Announcements (PSAs) in various languages, television PSAs in English and Spanish, online videos, and social media outreach. The campaign will run throughout 2016, and comes as the nation celebrates the 48thanniversary of the Fair Housing Act, the landmark law that was passed one week after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in April1968.
Every April, HUD, local communities, fair housing advocates, and fair housing organizations across the country commemorate Fair Housing Month by hosting a variety of activities that enhance Americans' awareness of their fair housing rights, highlight HUD's fair housing enforcement efforts, and emphasize the importance of ending housing discrimination.
""A core belief of our values as Americans is the idea that every person deserves a fair chance to secure safe and stable housing,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""Your race, how you get around, the size of your family, whether you come from another country, if you are a man or a woman, or whatever your religious beliefs are should never hinder your housing goals. I am proud of the work our fair housing staff does every day in conjunction with our state and local partners to ensure that everyone's fair housing rights are honored.""
Through an array of enforcement activities, fair housing policy initiatives, and education and outreach efforts, HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity continues to take action against individuals and housing providers that discriminate. Last year, HUD and its Fair Housing Assistance Program partner agencies received 8,293 complaints alleging discrimination based on one or more of the Fair Housing Act's seven protected classes: race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, and disability. During that period, the categories with the highest number of complaints were disability and race, respectively. HUD also focused on lending discrimination, as well as various forms of discrimination faced by women, families with children, and LGBT persons.
""Nearly 50 years after it was passed, the Fair Housing Act remains a powerful tool to ensure housing providers give every person an equal chance to find the home that is right for them, without prejudice or discrimination,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""As we move to implement the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing rule in partnership with local jurisdictions, we are pleased to be entering the next level of fair housing where every family, regardless of zip code, has access to the resources and opportunity they need to get ahead.""
""This campaign is an important component of our efforts to both eliminate unfair barriers to housing opportunity and to establish vibrant, diverse, and inclusive neighborhoods in all communities,"" said Shanna L. Smith, president and CEO of the National Fair Housing Alliance, HUD's partner in the creation of the campaign.
In particular, the new media campaign reinforces the ideals behind the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing (https://www.huduser.gov/portal/affht_pt.html#final-rule) rule, which provides communities that receive HUD funding with the tools and support needed to meet their fair housing planning obligations. The final AFFH rule also provides HUD program participants with guidelines and the data they need to meet their fair housing planning obligations. Since the Fair Housing Act first became law, HUD funding recipients have been obligated to reduce barriers to housing choice and to promote equal access to opportunity, including economic opportunity.
The campaign begins with ""A Zip Code Should Not Determine a Child's Future,"" a PSA ad that features children of different ethnicities looking toward a bright future because they have the chance to live in neighborhoods filled with opportunity. And because community involvement in the planning process is a critical element of AFFH, the HUD media campaign includes customizable posters that local cities and other jurisdictions can use to announce neighborhood meetings that residents can attend.
Additional ads are available here and here. More will be unveiled throughout April and in coming months."
04/04/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-042.cfm,HUD Makes $174 Million Available Through New Housing Trust Fund,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced that nearly $174 million will soon be made available through first-ever allocations of the National Housing Trust Fund. HUD Secretary Julián Castro made announcement to a gathering of the National Low-Income Housing Coalition meeting in Washington. Read more about the National Housing Trust Fund (https://www.hudexchange.info/resources/documents/National-Housing-Fund-Trust-Factsheet.pdf).
The National Housing Trust Fund is a new affordable housing production program that will complement existing Federal, state and local efforts to increase and preserve the supply of decent, safe, and sanitary affordable housing for extremely low- and very low-income households, including families experiencing homelessness. The Fund is capitalized through contributions by government sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The Fund will be administered by HUD.
HUD expects to make individual allocations to States later this spring and anticipates these funds can be drawn upon as early as this summer.
""This is an exciting new tool to help states across the country to produce more critically needed affordable housing,"" said Castro. ""The National Housing Trust Fund will play an important role in creating new opportunities for those who are most in need to secure a safe, decent and affordable home they can call their own.""
Eight years after it was authorized by the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA), the Housing Trust Fund is only now being capitalized through contributions made by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In December 2014, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) directed these Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs) to begin setting aside and allocating funds to the Housing Trust. In January of 2015, HUD issued interim rules to guide states on how to implement their Housing Trust Funds.

04/08/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/Wells_Fargo_Release.cfm,Wells Fargo Bank Agrees to Pay $1.2 Billion for Improper Mortgage Lending Practices,"WASHINGTON - The Department of Justice announced today that the United States has settled civil mortgage fraud claims against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (Wells Fargo) and Wells Fargo executive Kurt Lofrano, stemming from Wells Fargo's participation in the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) Direct Endorsement Lender Program. In the settlement, Wells Fargo agreed to pay $1.2 billion and admitted, acknowledged and accepted responsibility for, among other things, certifying to the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), during the period from May 2001 through December 2008, that certain residential home mortgage loans were eligible for FHA insurance when in fact they were not, resulting in the Government having to pay FHA insurance claims when some of those loans defaulted. The agreement resolves the United States' civil claims in its lawsuit in the Southern District of New York, as well as an investigation conducted by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York regarding Wells Fargo's FHA origination and underwriting practices subsequent to the claims in its lawsuit and an investigation conducted by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California into whether American Mortgage Network, LLC (AMNET), a mortgage lender acquired by Wells Fargo in 2009, falsely certified and submitted ineligible residential mortgage loans for FHA insurance.
The settlement was approved today by U.S. District Judge Jesse M. Furman for the Southern District of New York. Read the settlement (https://www.justice.gov/opa/file/839796/download).
""This settlement is another step in the Department of Justice's continuing efforts to hold accountable FHA approved lenders that unlawfully submitted false claims at the expense of American homeowners and taxpayers,"" said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Benjamin C. Mizer, head of the Justice Department's Civil Division. ""In addition to today's resolution with Wells Fargo, the department has pursued similar misconduct by numerous other lenders, returning more than $4 billion to the FHA fund and the Treasury and filing suit where appropriate. We remain committed to protecting the public fisc from all who seek to abuse it, whether they do business on Wall Street or Main Street.""
""This Administration remains committed to holding lenders accountable for their lending practices,"" said Secretary Julián Castro for HUD. ""The $1.2 billion settlement with Wells Fargo is the largest recovery for loan origination violations in FHA's history. Yet, this monetary figure can never truly make up for the countless families that lost homes as a result of poor lending practices.""
""Today, Wells Fargo, one of the biggest mortgage lenders in the world, has been held responsible for years of reckless underwriting, while relying on government insurance to deal with the damage,"" said U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara for the Southern District of New York. ""Wells Fargo has long taken advantage of the FHA mortgage insurance program, designed to help millions of Americans realize the dream of home ownership, to write thousands and thousands of faulty loans. Driven to maximize profits, Wells Fargo employed shoddy underwriting practices to drive up loan volume, at the expense of loan quality. Even though Wells Fargo identified through internal quality assurance reviews thousands of problematic loans, the bank decided not to report them to HUD. As a result, while Wells Fargo enjoyed huge profits from its FHA loan business, the government was left holding the bag when the bad loans went bust. With today's settlement, Wells Fargo has finally resolved the years-long litigation, adding to the list of large financial institutions against which this office has successfully pursued civil fraud prosecutions.""
""Misconduct in the mortgage industry helped lead to a destructive financial crisis that spanned the globe,"" said Acting U.S. Attorney Brian Stretch for the Northern District of California. ""American Mortgage Network's origination of FHA-insured loans that did not comply with government requirements also caused major losses to the public fisc. Today's settlement demonstrates the Department of Justice's resolve to pursue remedies against those who engaged in this type of misconduct.""
""This matter is not just a failure by Wells Fargo to comply with federal requirements in FHA's Direct Endorsement Lender program - it's a failure by one of our trusted participants in the FHA program to demonstrate a commitment to integrity and to ordinary Americans who are trying to fulfill their dreams of homeownership,"" said Inspector General David A. Montoya for HUD.
According to the second amended complaint filed in Manhattan federal court, the government had alleged:
Wells Fargo has been a participant in the Direct Endorsement Lender program, a federal program administered by FHA. As a Direct Endorsement Lender, Wells Fargo has the authority to originate, underwrite and certify mortgages for FHA insurance. If a Direct Endorsement Lender approves a mortgage loan for FHA insurance and the loan later defaults, the holder or servicer of the loan may submit an insurance claim to HUD for the outstanding balance of the defaulted loan, along with any associated costs, which HUD must then pay. Under the Direct Endorsement Lender program, neither the FHA nor HUD reviews a loan for compliance with FHA requirements before it is endorsed for FHA insurance. Direct Endorsement Lenders are therefore required to follow program rules designed to ensure that they are properly underwriting and certifying mortgages for FHA insurance and maintaining a quality control program that can prevent and correct any deficiencies in their underwriting. The quality control program requirements include conducting a full review of all loans that go 60 days into default within the first six payments, known as ""early payment defaults""; taking prompt and adequate corrective action upon discovery of fraud or serious underwriting problems; and disclosing to HUD in writing all loans containing evidence of fraud or other serious underwriting deficiencies. Wells Fargo failed to comply with these basic requirements.
First, between at least May 2001 and October 2005, Wells Fargo, the largest HUD-approved residential mortgage lender, engaged in a regular practice of reckless origination and underwriting of its FHA retail loans, all the while knowing that it would not be responsible when the defective loans went into default. To maximize its loan volume (and profits), Wells Fargo elected to hire temporary staff to churn out and approve an ever increasing quantity of FHA loans, but neglected to provide this inexperienced staff with proper training. At the same time, Wells Fargo's management applied pressure on its underwriters to approve more and more FHA loans. The bank also imposed short turnaround times for deciding whether to approve the loans, employed lax underwriting standards and controls and paid bonuses to underwriters and other staff based on the number of loans approved. Predictably, as a result, Wells Fargo's loan volume and profits soared, but the quality of its loans declined significantly. Yet, when Wells Fargo's senior management was repeatedly advised by its own quality assurance reviews of serious problems with the quality of the retail FHA loans that the Bank was originating, management disregarded the findings and failed to implement proper and effective corrective measures, leaving HUD to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in claims for defaulted loans.
Second, Wells Fargo failed to self-report to HUD the bad loans that it was originating, in violation of FHA program reporting requirements. During the period 2002 through 2010, HUD required Direct Endorsement Lenders to perform post-closing reviews of the loans that they originated and to report to HUD in writing loans that contained fraud or other serious deficiencies. This requirement provided HUD with an opportunity to investigate the defective loans and request reimbursement for any claim that HUD had paid or request indemnification for any future claim, as appropriate. During this nine-year period, Wells Fargo, through its post-closing reviews, internally identified thousands of defective FHA loans that it was required to self-report to HUD, including a substantial number of loans that had gone into ""early payment default."" However, instead of reporting these loans to HUD as required, Wells Fargo engaged in virtually no self-reporting during the four-year period from 2002 through 2005 and only minimal self-reporting after 2005.
In his capacity as Vice President of Credit-Risk - Quality Assurance at Wells Fargo, Lofrano executed on Wells Fargo's behalf the annual certifications required by HUD for the Bank's participation in the Direct Endorsement Lender program for certain years. Lofrano also organized and participated in the working group responsible for creating and implementing Wells Fargo's self-reporting policies and procedures. In contravention of HUD's requirements, that group failed to report to HUD loans that Wells Fargo had internally identified as containing material underwriting findings. Moreover, Lofrano received Wells Fargo quality assurance reports identifying thousands of FHA loans with material findings - very few of which Wells Fargo reported to HUD.
* * *
As part of the settlement, Wells Fargo has admitted, acknowledged and accepted responsibility for, among other things, the following conduct: During the period from May 2001 through, on or about Dec. 31, 2008, Wells Fargo submitted to HUD certifications stating that certain residential home mortgage loans were eligible for FHA insurance when in fact they were not, resulting in the Government having to pay FHA insurance claims when certain of those loans defaulted. From May 2001 through January 2003, Wells Fargo's quality assurance group conducted monthly internal reviews of random samples of the retail FHA mortgage loans that the Bank had already originated, underwritten, and closed, which identified for most of the months that in excess of 25 percent of the loans and in several consecutive months, more than 40 percent of the loans, had a material finding. For a number of the months during the period from February 2003 through September 2004, the material finding rate was in excess of 20 percent. A ""material"" finding was defined by Wells Fargo generally as a loan file that did not conform to internal parameters and/or specific FHA parameters, contained significant risk factors affecting the underwriting decision and/or evidenced misrepresentation.
Wells Fargo also admitted, acknowledged and accepted responsibility for the following additional conduct: Between 2002 and October 2005, Wells Fargo made only one self-report to HUD, involving multiple loans. During that same period, the Bank identified through its internal quality assurance reviews approximately 3,000 FHA loans with material findings. Further, during the period between October 2005 and December 2010, Wells Fargo only self-reported approximately 300 loans to HUD. During that same period, Wells Fargo's internal quality assurance reviews identified more than 2,900 additional FHA loans containing material findings that the Bank did not self-report to HUD. The government was required to pay FHA insurance claims when certain of these loans that Wells Fargo identified with material findings defaulted.
Lofrano admitted, acknowledged, and accepted responsibility for, among other things, the following matters in which he participated: From Jan. 1, 2002, until Dec. 31, 2010, he held the position of Vice President of Credit Risk – Quality Assurance at Wells Fargo; in that capacity, he supervised the Decision Quality Management group; in 2004, he was asked to organize a working sub-group to address reporting to HUD; in or about October 2005, he organized a working group that drafted Wells Fargo's new self-reporting policy and procedures; and during the period October 2005 through Dec. 31, 2010, based on application of the Bank's new self-reporting policy and by committee decision, Wells Fargo did not report to HUD the majority of the FHA loans that the Bank's internal quality assurance reviews had identified as having material findings.

04/11/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-046.cfm,HUD Launches Improved Manufactured Housing Dispute Resolution Program,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced new tools to help consumers and the manufactured housing industry to resolve disputes involving the purchase and installation of manufactured housing. HUD's Office of Manufactured Housing Programs (OMHP) is unveiling a new website (www.huddrp.net/) and other education tools to help homeowners, manufacturers, retailers and installers to navigate the dispute resolution process in those states that do not have their own process.
There are 23 States without their own HUD-approved dispute resolution program. HUD is updating its dispute resolution program in the following states: Alaska, California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Wisconsin and Wyoming.
""I'm so excited about the launch of these new tools,"" said Pamela Beck Danner, Administrator for HUD's Office of Manufactured Housing Programs. ""They will help consumers and industry better understand the process and lead to an efficient and timely resolution of issues among all parties involved.""
The HUD Manufactured Home Dispute Resolution Program provides timely resolution of disputes between manufacturers, retailers and installers regarding the responsibility for correcting or repairing homeowner-reported defects within one-year after the home is first installed. The program is intended to address defects in construction, safety and installation, but does not address cosmetic issues and contractual agreements.
Requests for dispute resolution are typically received from homeowners, but retailers, manufacturers and installers can also submit a request for dispute resolution when involved with disagreements between parties regarding unresolved manufactured home issues. The website explains who can use the program, provides downloadable educational materials about how the process works, and allows for the filing of disputes on-line. Available for download are an illustrative video, a tri-fold brochure and Frequently Asked Questions about the program.
HUD is also encouraging State Administrative Agencies and manufactured housing associations to promote this new dispute resolution program to industry stakeholders and homeowners alike. Learn more about HUD's Office of Manufactured Housing Programs on HUD's website."

Cox Communications is extending its Connect2Compete (www.connect2compete.org/cox) low-cost Internet offering to any HUD-assisted household with school-age children within Cox's 18-state service area. Cox operates 6 clustered cable systems in 18 states: Arizona, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Virginia. It is the first Internet service provider within the ConnectHome umbrella to extend such an offering throughout its entire nationwide footprint. This investment from Cox Communications has the potential to impact nearly 250,000 students across the nation currently residing in a HUD-assisted home.
Cox Communications President Pat Esser joined HUD Secretary Julián Castro in Phoenix, Ariz. at the Phoenix Landing Apartments complex to make this important announcement. Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton was also on hand along with a number of Phoenix landing residents and community supporters. Following the announcement, Cox Communications hosted a Connect2Compete enrollment event for residents to sign up for the service and schedule their installation dates.
In making today's announcement, Cox President Pat Esser noted the importance of community leaders who recognize the benefit to students of having Internet access in order to compete in the classroom and in their careers.
""Technology and the Internet play an increasingly critical role in the education of our youth. Yet, students cannot take the Internet home in their backpacks,"" said Esser. ""We are committed to staying at the forefront of the Internet adoption movement. Through strong partnerships in the communities we serve, we will build more bridges to enable all families to cross the digital divide, regardless of where they live.""
""ConnectHome is expanding opportunity for our nation's next generation of inventors, CEOs and artists,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""Today's announcement will transform the lives of kids across the country, opening the door for students to live up to their full potential and not be limited in what they can achieve.""
Building on the Obama Administration's goal to expand high speed broadband to all Americans, in July 2015, President Obama and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Julián Castro announced, ConnectHome (http://connecthome.hud.gov/), an initiative to extend affordable broadband access to families living in HUD-assisted housing. Through ConnectHome, Internet service providers, non-profits and the private sector are offering broadband access, technical training, digital literacy programs, and devices for residents in assisted housing units in 28 pilot communities across the nation. While nearly two-thirds of America's lowest-income households own a computer, less than half have a home Internet subscription. HUD's ConnectHome initiative strives to ensure that students can access the same level of high-speed Internet at home that they possess in their classrooms.
In today's 21stcentury global economy, 90 percent of college applications are submitted online. Students without access to high-speed Internet access are left without the tools and digital literacy skills critical for success.
Since last July, Cox Communications has been collaborating with HUD, local governments, community leaders, and nonprofit organizations to provide affordable broadband access to families receiving HUD housing assistance in four communities: Meriden, Connecticut; Macon, Georgia; Baton Rouge, Louisiana and New Orleans, Louisiana. Click here (http://connecthome.hud.gov/) for more information about the ConnectHome Initiative.
Cox has led the industry by voluntarily offering affordable Internet service to low-income families with school-aged children. Along with the FCC, Cox is a founding partner of the Connect2Compete program, which is modeled after an Internet adoption initiative the company established in the late 1990s. Since 2012, more than 160,000 people have been connected to the Internet through Cox's Connect2Compete efforts. Notably, more than half of low-income families who benefit from discounted Internet access report having seen improved grades for children in the home.
Committed to serving the students and their families across the community, the company also has funded more than 75 Cox Technology Centers across its 18-state footprint. Its commercial services division, Cox Business, provides Internet services to more than 7,400 schools serving 4 million students.
Cox's Connect2Compete service is $9.95 per month for eligible families, and includes downloads speeds up to 10 Mbps, free in-home WiFi, free installation and free access to hundreds of thousands of WiFi hotspots strategically located in markets across the country through Cox WiFi and Cable WiFi.

04/15/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-050.cfm,HUD Extends Moving to Work Agreements Until 2028,"WASHINGTON - Thirty-nine local public housing agencies across the country will continue to enjoy significantly greater flexibility to operate their federally funded housing programs following an announcement today by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Existing agreements under HUD's Moving to Work (MTW) Demonstration Program for 39 public housing authorities (PHAs) will now continue in effect until 2028 (see list below).
MTW gives housing agencies exemptions from many existing requirements associated with their public housing and voucher programs, as well as more flexibility with how they use their federal funds. The 20-year-old demonstration also allows agencies to propose and test innovative, locally designed approaches to administering housing programs and self-sufficiency strategies.
""This extension provides HUD with an additional 12 years to learn from the innovative work of MTW agencies,"" said Lourdes Castro Ramirez, HUD's Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing. ""We're confident that locally driven strategies designed to expand housing choice and promote greater economic self-sufficiency will strengthen communities and further affordable housing opportunities.""
The MTW demonstration has three goals - reducing costs while achieving greater cost-effectiveness; providing families with incentives to become economically self-sufficient, and increasing housing choices for low-income families. While MTW agencies have considerable flexibility, they must still abide by all other federal rules and regulations, including the Fair Housing Act, the Civil Rights Act, labor standards, environmental rules, procurement guidelines, demolition and disposition procedures and relocation regulations.
Participating MTW Agencies are:
• Alaska Housing Finance Corporation, AK
• Atlanta Housing Authority, GA

04/18/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-051.cfm,HUD Files Housing Discrimination Charge After Kansas Woman Told to Move to Housing 'Designed for Handicapped Persons',"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today it is charging landlords in Beloit, Kansas with violating the Fair Housing Act after allegedly discriminating against a female tenant with disabilities by not renewing her lease, sending her a notice containing discriminatory statements about her disability, and retaliating against her for filing a previous fair housing complaint. Read HUD's charge.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to make housing unavailable to any person because of a disability. It also prohibits retaliating against a person because they filed a fair housing complaint.
""No one should have to deal with the prospect of losing their home because they have a disability or be subjected to retaliation for standing up for their rights,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Landlords are required to grant reasonable accommodations when tenants need them and HUD will continue working to ensure that they meet that obligation.""
The case came to HUD's attention when the resident, who has a physical disability that substantially limits her ability to walk and sometimes requires the use of a wheelchair, filed a complaint with HUD alleging the Blass Family Trust, owner, and Lois Blass, trustee and property manager, of rental homes in Beloit, Kansas, discriminated against her due to her disability and retaliated for filing a previous fair housing complaint.
Specifically, the resident alleged that the property manager of the single family home she was renting sent her a letter stating that she was a holdover tenant and that she should move to housing ""designed for handicapped persons."" The letter also stated that the home was ""not designed for a handicapped person"" and urged her to move out, while tenants at other properties were not given similar notices and were allowed to keep renting month-to-month. The tenant moved out of the rental home and into a less accessible and more costly rental property.
The woman also alleged that the landlord's letter was issued in retaliation for her filing a fair housing complaint against the Blass Family Trust when they refused to allow her to keep her assistance animal. That complaint had resulted in an agreement that had allowed the woman to keep her assistance animal.
The resident elected to have the case heard in federal district court instead of by an administrative law judge. If a judge or jury finds that discrimination has occurred, they may award damages to the woman for the harm caused by the discrimination. Injunctive relief and other equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees may be imposed. In federal court, an aggrieved person may also receive punitive damages.
In FY 2015, disability was the most common basis of fair housing complaints filed with HUD and its partner agencies, being cited as a basis for 4,548 complaints, or nearly 55 percent of the overall total.
Read HUD's notice regarding service or companion animals.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to www.hud.gov/fairhousing, or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, which can be accessed through Apple and Android devices."

New Residential Construction data for April 2016 will be released on Tuesday, May 17, 2016, at 8:30 A.M. EDT.
EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take two months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, 4 months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2%) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90-percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised about three percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found on our web site listed above.
* 90% confidence interval includes zero. The Census Bureau does not have sufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero.

The Austin team was one of the four team finalists to develop a plan to redevelop the public housing project Monteria Village in Santa Barbara, California. HUD also announced a team from University of Maryland as the runner up.
""It's amazing to watch our next generation create a plan for the future of affordable housing in a way that helps low-income families become self-sufficient,"" said Katherine O'Regan, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research. ""As we celebrate the third year of this competition, our hope is to continue this creative and forward thinking when it comes to affordable housing.""
HUD's Innovation in Affordable Housing competition is intended to encourage research and innovation in affordable housing, to raise practitioner and future practitioner capacity, and to foster cross-cutting team-work within the design and community development process. Multi-disciplinary graduate student teams were asked to create innovative solutions involving design, planning, and finance.
The University of Texas at Austin team will receive a $20,000 award and the team from the University of Maryland will receive $10,000. The competition jurors praised the Austin team members for their sophisticated site plan that connects homes and social space. The team also received very high marks for their water conservation plans and their plans to include an education center which will provide school and job training to address the needs of the community.
The University of Maryland was judged runner-up in this year's competition. The ""Terrapin Team's"" design for a new construction development for affordable housing includes a four-story multifamily development that houses a food co-op, a community center, and easy access to a community garden nearby.
HUD and the Santa Barbara Housing Authority challenged multi-disciplinary teams of graduate students to consider the complex challenges associated with rehabbing the current structure or demolishing it and creating new construction. These student participants had to consider design, community development, and financing elements in order to provide an all-encompassing plan and solution that would allow the housing authority to meet its goal of offering safe and sustainable affordable housing. Students also needed to understand the needs of the intended residents, the zoning restrictions, and leveraging opportunities."
04/22/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-054.cfm,HUD Announces Agreement with Fidelity Bank to Resolve Allegations of Unfair Lending Practices,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today a $1 million agreement between the Fair Housing Project of North Carolina Legal Aid and North Carolina-based Fidelity Bank to resolve allegations the mortgage lender engaged in unfair lending practices against minority applicants. Read the agreement.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to make housing unavailable or to discriminate in the terms, conditions, or privileges of the sale of a dwelling because of race. The Fair Housing Act also makes it unlawful for any person or entity whose business includes residential real estate-related transactions to discriminate in these transactions, or terms or conditions, because of race. Banks and other lenders are prohibited from discriminating with respect to home mortgage loans.
""Whether intentional or not, stark disparities exist in lending patterns and access to credit along racial and ethnic lines,"" said HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity Gustavo Velasquez. ""HUD remains committed to not only enforcing the law, but also facilitating productive relationships between lenders and advocacy groups that help make lenders more aware of their obligations under the Fair Housing Act.""
The Conciliation Agreement stems from a complaint that was filed by the Fair Housing Project, Legal Aid of North Carolina, Inc., a HUD Fair Housing Initiatives Program agency based in Raleigh, alleging that the bank denied or made housing and home mortgage loans unavailable because of race.
Under the agreement, Fidelity will make investments and community development loans in predominantly minority census tracts where at least 40 percent of these loans will specifically promote affordable housing. For this purpose, the Bank has committed to earmarking at least $500,000 each year for two years, for a total of $1 million.
In addition, The Fidelity Bank will display a HUD Fair Housing poster at its Oberlin Road branch in Raleigh. The bank will also prominently display its non-discrimination policies at that branch in English and Spanish, and provide fair lending training to staff, including loan originators and employees engaged in loan processing and underwriting.
Last year, about one quarter, or 28 percent, of all fair housing complaints filed with HUD and Fair Housing Assistance Program agencies (HUD partners,) cited race as the basis for the complaints.
People who believe theyhave experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed at www.hud.gov/fairhousing or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, which can be accessed through Apple and Android devices."

04/25/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-056.cfm,HUD and Justice Department Award $1.75 Million to Help Justice-Involved Youth Find Jobs and Housing,"WASHINGTON - In an effort to help young people involved in the justice system find jobs and housing, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) today announced $1.75 million for Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) and nonprofit legal service organizations to address the challenges justice-involved individuals face when trying to find work and a place to call home. The grantees are listed below.
Under the Juvenile Reentry Assistance Program (JRAP), funded through DOJ's Second Chance Act funds, HUD and DOJ are teaming up to help young Americans who've paid their debt to society rehabilitate and reintegrate back into their communities. JRAP funding was awarded to Public Housing Agencies who have a partnership with a nonprofit legal service organization with experience providing legal services to juveniles. Read local summaries of the grants.
HUD Secretary Julián Castro and U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced the funding during a news conference with local leaders in Philadelphia today.
""Reconnecting young people who've paid their debt to society to decent jobs and housing allows them to turn the page and become active, productive members of their communities,"" said Secretary Castro. ""These grants offer a helping hand to those who deserve a second chance so they have a real opportunity to reach their full potential.""
""The future of our nation depends upon the future of our young people - including young people who have become involved with our justice system,"" said Attorney General Lynch. ""By helping justice-involved youth find decent jobs and stable housing after they return home, these critical grants provide a foundation for a fresh start and offer a path towards productivity and purpose. In the months ahead, the Department of Justice will continue helping justice-involved youth enrich their lives and improve our country.""
Having a juvenile or a criminal record can severely limit a person's ability to seek higher education, find good employment or secure affordable housing. Today, there are nearly 55,000 individuals under age 21 in juvenile justice facilities, and approximately 185,000 young adults aged 18 to 24 in state and federal prisons. These collateral consequences create unnecessary barriers to economic opportunity and productivity. President Obama and members of his Cabinet, via the Federal Interagency Reentry Council, continue to take impactful steps to ensure those exiting the justice system become productive, law-abiding citizens. Today's announcement is consistent with HUD's recently released guidance on the application of Fair Housing Act standards to the use of criminal records by providers of housing and real estate-related transactions, and the recent guidance (See PIH Notice 2015-19) for public housing authorities and owners of federally assisted housing on excluding the use of arrest records in housing decisions.
To help alleviate collateral consequences associated with a juvenile or criminal record, JRAP assists young people up to age 24 residing in public housing, or who would be residing in public housing but for their record, by:
Expunging, sealing, and/or correcting juvenile or adult records; as permitted by state law; Assisting targeted youth in mitigating/preventing collateral consequences such as reinstating revoked or suspended drivers' licenses; Counseling regarding legal rights and obligations in searching for employment; Providing guidance for readmission to school; and Creating or modifying child support orders and other family law services, and more.

04/26/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-057.cfm,HUD Announces Agreement with Las Vegas Landlords Accused of Unfairly Evicting Woman with Disabilities,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today an agreement with a group of Las Vegas landlords settling allegations they retaliated against a tenant with disabilities because she requested permission to install a ramp that would allow her to enter and exit her apartment. Read the agreement.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from retaliating against residents with disabilities who request reasonable accommodations in policies or practices. Additionally, the law makes it illegal to make housing unavailable to any person because of a disability.
""Reasonable modifications don't constitute special treatment and are essential to enabling persons with disabilities to fully enjoy their homes,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Today's settlement represents HUD's ongoing commitment to taking action when landlords treat persons with disabilities unfairly just because they asked for a modification or accommodation they were entitled to.""
The case came to HUD's attention after the tenant, who has a mobility disability, filed a complaint alleging that the owners and managers of Las Vegas Manor Apartments and their on-site agents refused to renew her lease in retaliation for making a request for the installation of a ramp.
The tenant alleged that she made repeated requests to the owners for a ramp, which they generally provided to tenants free of charge. The owners eventually agreed to install the ramp, but soon after installing it, they refused to renew the tenant's lease. During HUD's investigation, one of the owners' agents indicated that he objected to the tenant's manner of requesting the ramp and, because of that, opted not to renew her lease.
Under the terms of the Conciliation Agreement, the owners and operators of Las Vegas Manor Apartments will pay the woman $10,000, obtain fair housing training, adopt a HUD-approved reasonable accommodation policy, and post a fair housing poster in the public area of the subject property.
Last year, disability was the most common basis of fair housing complaints filed with HUD and Fair Housing Assistance Program agencies (HUD partners,) cited as a basis for more than half, or nearly 55 percent, of all complaints.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to www.hud.gov/fairhousing, or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, which can be accessed through Apple and Android devices."
04/27/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-058.cfm,HUD Charges Massachusetts Landlord with Discriminating Against Families with Children,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is charging the owner of a Springfield, Massachusetts rental property with violating the Fair Housing Act by refusing to rent an apartment to a husband and wife with children. The landlordwas also charged with printing discriminatory statements in his lease and retaliating against the family after they complained. Read HUD's charge.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to deny or limit housing because a family has children under the age of 18, to make statements that discriminate against families with children, and to retaliate against any person for exercising rights under the Fair Housing Act.
""No family should be denied the chance to rent the home of their choice or have to live in fear of losing their home simply because they have children,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""This charge sends a clear message that HUD is committed to protecting the housing rights of families with children.""
HUD's discrimination charge comes after the parents of a two-year-old child filed a complaint with HUD claiming that the landlord denied them the opportunity to rent an apartment in the four-unit property because, according to the landlord, the property contained lead hazards and was therefore unsuitable for children under the age of six. The complainants were already residing in an apartment in the building with the wife's mother at the time they attempted to rent their own apartment.
The charge alleges that the landlord told the family that he would not rent an apartment to them because they had a child under the age of six and were also expecting another baby. The charge further alleges that the landlord had a policy prohibiting children younger than six from residing on the premises and requiring pregnant women to notify the landlord and vacate their apartment. The charge alleges that almost immediately after the complainants filed their complaint with HUD, the landlord began eviction proceedings against them and the wife's mother.
HUD guidance on lead paint and Fair Housing Act requirements makes it clear that while property owners may tell families about housing units that have not been remediated for lead paint, the presence of lead-based paint cannot be used as a reason to refuse to rent. In addition, Massachusetts state law requires owners to remediate lead when a child occupies a unit built before 1978. The Lead Law requires the removal or covering of lead paint hazards in homes built before 1978 where any children under six live.
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he or she may award damages to the complainants for their loss as a result of the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties in order to vindicate the public interest. If the case is heard in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages to the complainants.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed at www.hud.gov/fairhousing or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, which can be accessed through Apple and Android devices."
04/28/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-059.cfm,"HUD Reaches Agreement with San Diego Property Owners, Managers Accused of Discriminating Against Persons with Disabilities","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today a $22,600 Conciliation Agreement between Housing Equality Law Project and the owners and managers of a San Diego-based property management company, settling allegations that they discriminated against persons with disabilities who required the use of assistance animals. Read the agreement.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from denying or limiting housing to persons with disabilities or from refusing to make reasonable accommodations in policies or practices. This includes waiving no pet policies for assistance or service animals.
""Requiring the use of an assistance or service animal shouldn't keep a person from qualifying for housing that meets their needs,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Today's agreement reaffirms HUD's commitment to ensuring that housing providers understand their obligations under the law and take steps to meet that obligation.""
The case came to HUD's attention when Housing Equality Law Project (HELP), a non-profit fair housing advocacy organization based in South San Francisco, filed a complaint alleging that the owners and managers of HKT Cal, Inc., discriminated against persons with disabilities. The allegations were based on tests HELP conducted between July 2013 and April 2014, which allegedly showed that several apartment complexes managed by HKT Cal, Inc., in San Diego and Spring Valley, California routinely denied housing and reasonable accommodations to persons who required assistance animals.
Under the terms of the agreement, HKT Cal will pay $22,600 to HELP to support the organization's education and legal advocacy work on behalf of their clients. In addition, the company agreed to provide fair housing training for its agents.
In FY 2015, disability was the most common basis of complaints filed with HUD and its partner agencies, being cited as a basis for 4,548 complaints, or nearly 55 percent of the overall total.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY).

04/29/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-060.cfm,"HUD Announces $9.9 Million in ""Sweat Equity"" Grants","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today awarded $9.9 million in ""sweat equity"" grants to produce at least 541 affordable homes for low-income individuals and families. Funded through HUD's Self-Help Homeownership Opportunity Program (SHOP), the funding awarded today, along with the labor contributed by these households, will significantly lower the cost of homeownership.
""Homeownership is part of the American dream and it's all the more meaningful when you're a first-time homebuyer,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""These self-help program grants encourage new owners and their communities to invest not only money but also time and hard work that benefits the whole neighborhood.""
The following organizations will receive SHOP funds (see individual descriptions below):
Habitat for Humanity International
$6,188,868
Tierra del Sol Housing Corporation (Consortium)
$1,682,632
Community Frameworks
$1,066,000
Housing Assistance Council
$1,040,000
TOTAL
$9,977,500
The SHOP program provides federal grants on a competitive basis to national and regional non-profit organizations and consortia that have experience in administering self-help homeownership housing programs. The SHOP grants must be used to purchase land and make necessary infrastructure improvements, which together may not exceed an average SHOP investment of $15,000 per dwelling unit. Leveraged funds must be used for the construction or rehabilitation of these homeownership units.
Selected newly constructed units will receive certification as ENERGY STAR qualified units. Selected appliances, products or features that are installed or replaced will be ENERGY STAR qualified. Water usage products will bear the WaterSense label. Many units will also have ""Green,"" ""Healthy Homes,"" and ""Universal Design"" features.
Homebuyers will contribute significant sweat equity toward the development of their units and/or the units of other homebuyers participating in the local self-help housing programs. These sweat equity contributions reduce the purchase price of the SHOP units and make these units affordable for low-income homebuyers. A minimum of 100 sweat equity hours is required from a household of two or more persons. A minimum of 50 sweat equity hours is required from a household of one person. Community participation consisting of volunteer labor contributions is also required. Sweat equity and volunteer labor may include, but are not limited to, landscaping, foundation work, painting, carpentry, trim work, drywall, roofing and siding for the housing. Reasonable accommodations must be made for persons with disabilities.
Grantees may carry out activities directly and/or distribute SHOP funds to local non-profit affiliates that will develop the SHOP units, select homebuyers, coordinate the homebuyer sweat equity and volunteer efforts, and assist in the arrangement of interim and permanent financing for the homebuyers. The grantees ensure that the new homebuyers can afford their homes at the time of purchase and for the long term. Many of the SHOP homebuyers are first-time homeowners and come from underserved groups.
Since 1996, when Congress first appropriated SHOP funds, the SHOP program has provided more than $407 million in federal grants that, together with significant leveraged funds and numerous volunteer hours, are transforming lives and neighborhoods through the production of over 28,500 units of affordable, homeownership housing."
04/29/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-061.cfm,HUD Joins Forces with the Campaign for Grade-Level Reading to Improve Literacy Skills for Children Living in Public Housing,"WASHINGTON - In an effort to promote and increase the work being done across the country to improve the grade-level reading skills of children living in federally assisted housing, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Julián Castro today announced HUD is joining forces with the Campaign for Grade-Level Reading (http://gradelevelreading.net/), a national partnership to ensure that more children in low-income families succeed in school and graduate prepared for college, a career, and active citizenship.
During a ceremony in Tampa, Florida, Secretary Castro announced HUD will team up with the Campaign for Grade-Level Reading to promote the great work Public Housing Agencies (PHAs), including the Tampa Housing Authority, are doing as partners in their local Campaigns for Grade-Level Reading and to encourage and support other PHAs in joining their local campaign. Through the local campaigns communities are implementing the strategies needed to increase literacy of school-age children; this new partnership will help to ensure these great strategies are reaching families living in public housing. Housing is a critical platform for a child's success and nearly four million low-income children are living in HUD-assisted housing. An important part of HUD's mission is to form partnerships between public housing agencies, private partners, and school systems that can enhance education outcomes needed to improve the life trajectories of these low-income children.
""Empowering our children with the basic skills they need to become successful helps them to reach their full potential,"" said Secretary Castro. ""There's no more important mission than to use housing as a platform for success and we need to make certain that our residents, particularly their children, have every opportunity that education can provide. I'm thrilled that the Tampa Housing Authority has taken on this initiative and will serve as a model for other housing authorities.""
The Campaign for Grade-Level Reading is a collaborative effort by foundations, leading social-sector organizations, business leaders, government agencies, states and communities that focuses on an important predictor of school success and high school graduation-reading proficiency by the end of third grade. Through the partnership, local Public Housing Authorities will be encouraged to work with local GLR Campaign communities to address the solution areas that are critical to achieving reading proficiency -- school readiness, school attendance, and summer learning. Promoting healthy on-track development and supporting parent success are also embedded in the partnership efforts.
""For children in low-income families, the stakes are even higher and the challenges much greater,"" said Ralph Smith, managing director of the Campaign for Grade-Level Reading. ""By embracing grade-level reading as an important goal, HUD and Public Housing Authorities are betting that low-income families can break the cycle of intergenerational poverty.""
The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) will bring HUD and the GLR Campaign together to highlight the work being done in up to 25 Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) participating in local campaigns across the country to improve educational outcomes for children living in HUD-assisted housing. HUD will highlight these (PHAs) and encourage others to join the effort."
04/29/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-062.cfm,HUD Announces Consent Order Resolving Sexual Harassment Case Against South Dakota Property Manager,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has settled a Fair Housing Act suit against a South Dakota property manager. The Consent Order resolves a claim that the property manager sexually harassed a female tenant. Read the Consent Order here.
The Fair Housing Act makes it illegal to discriminate against individuals on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, familial status, or disability. Sexual harassment is a form of illegal sex discrimination.
""A home is a place where every person should feel safe and secure,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Sexual harassment in housing violates not just the sanctity of one's home, but also the law. HUD will continue to take action to protect the fair housing rights of sexual harassment victims and ensure that no woman is forced to endure unwanted sexual advances in order to keep a roof over her head.""
The Consent Order was entered by a HUD administrative law judge on April 8, 2016. Respondents Carrol Goodsell, a South Dakota property manager, and his company, Goodsell General Contracting, LLC, admitted no liability in agreeing to the settlement. Under the terms of the agreement, respondents will pay $24,600 to the female complainant and her family, including her two children and her boyfriend. Respondents also agreed to utilize a third-party to interact with tenants, attend fair housing training, and adopt and distribute a written policy against sexual harassment to current and future tenants.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to www.hud.gov/fairhousing, or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, which can be accessed through Apple and Android devices."
05/02/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-063.cfm,HUD Awards $355 Million for Local Homeless Programs,"WASHINGTON - Today, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Julián Castro awarded $355 million to more than 1,200 local homeless housing and service programs across the U.S. and Puerto Rico (see attached chart). These Continuum of Care (CoC) grants support the Obama Administration's efforts to end homelessness and build upon the $1.6 billion in funding HUD awarded through a first round of funding in March. View a complete list of all the state and local homeless projects awarded funding.
""We know how to end homelessness and these grants support local programs that are proven to prevent and end homelessness as we've come to know it,"" said Secretary Castro. ""As we continue to make progress toward ending homelessness in this country, HUD is challenging communities to use more cost effective solutions to help those experiencing homelessness.""
Matthew Doherty, executive director of the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, added, ""The results of this competition show that communities are doing the hard work of assessing the needs of people experiencing homelessness and are reallocating funding to ensure that people have access to the quickest possible paths to permanent homes. We applaud communities across the country for their commitment to ending homelessness for everyone once and for all, and know that these investments are critical for fulfilling those commitments.""
The competition to award FY 2015 CoC grants was the most competitive ever, both locally and nationally. This is consistent with HUD's policy goals as well as Congressional direction to stringently review performance, increase competition for CoCs, and not simply fund renewals in the FY 2015 CoC competition.
HUD strongly encouraged local applicants to prioritize their funding request very carefully, using a mix of performance data and local needs. In addition, applicants were encouraged to submit projects that were based on research-driven approaches and supported the nation's goals to prevent and end homelessness. As a result, local CoCs eliminated a combined $124 million in renewal funding from lower performing projects in order to apply for new housing projects. These new projects will provide permanent supportive housing and rapid re-housing solutions for those experiencing homelessness.
Ultimately, the awards made today, and those awarded in March, will help us achieve the bold goals established in 2010 by President Obama and 19 federal agencies and offices that form the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH) in the nation's first-ever comprehensive strategy to prevent and end homelessness, Opening Doors: Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness (www.usich.gov/opening_doors/). This means continuing the progress made in reducing the number of people experiencing homelessness and setting a path to ending homelessness in this country. HUD estimates there were 564,708 persons experiencing homelessness on a single night in 2015. Since 2010, local communities around the country reported an 11 percent reduction in overall homelessness, a decline of more than 72,000 persons. During that same time, veteran homelessness fell by 36 percent; chronic homelessness declined 22 percent; and family homelessness declined by 19 percent."

HUD's Office of Regional Counsel for New England, which has jurisdiction over the case, issued the Charge of Discrimination on April 26. Read the charge.
The Fair Housing Act protects residents with disabilities who request reasonable accommodations in policies or practices. Additionally, the law makes it illegal to make housing unavailable to any person because of a disability.
""Persons with disabilities depend on reasonable accommodations to level the playing field when it comes to finding a place to call home. Refusing to provide them denies access to housing and it violates the law,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will continue to take action when owners and homeowner associations fail to meet their obligations under the Fair Housing Act.""
The case came to HUD's attention after a person with disabilities filed a complaint alleging that he was denied the opportunity to buy a unit at Thompkins Manor, a 155-unit cooperative in White Plains, New York, because of his disabilities. The man's parents had created a supplemental needs irrevocable trust to provide for the man's care. In August 2013, the man and his parents attempted to purchase a cooperative unit using the trust as the owner. According to the Charge, 505 Central Avenue Corp., which owns Thompkins Manor, rejected the application because the cooperative did not permit ownership by trust. The family allegedly asked the company to make an exception to its ownership rule as a reasonable accommodation, but it refused to do so.
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he or she may award damages to the complainants for their loss as a result of the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties in order to vindicate the public interest. If the case is heard in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages to the complainants.
Last year, disability was the most common basis of fair housing complaints filed with HUD and Fair Housing Assistance Program agencies (HUD partners,) cited as a basis for more than half, or nearly 55 percent, of all complaints.

05/03/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-066.cfm,HUD Offers $2 Million in Grants to Support Research to Reduce Housing-Related Health Hazards,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced that it is making $2 million available to support research to develop and improve methods for the identification and control of key residential health hazards. Key hazards include issues such as pest infestation, poor indoor air quality, injury prevention, mold and excess moisture, and lead in drinking water. It is especially important to protect vulnerable populations, such as children, seniors, and people with chronic illnesses such as asthma, from exposure to these hazards.
HUD Secretary Julián Castro is focused on advancing policies that create opportunities for all Americans, including helping children and families secure quality housing by protecting them from the hazards of lead-based paint and other home health and safety hazards. Unsafe and unhealthy homes affect the health of millions of people of all income levels, geographic areas, and walks of life in the U.S. These conditions affect the economy directly, through increased utilization of health care services, and indirectly, through lost wages and increased school days missed.
""It is critical that practical and cost effective methods be developed to make and keep the homes of Americans safe and healthy, said Michelle Miller, Acting Director of the Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes. ""We know that poor quality housing can contribute to injury and illness, which is entirely preventable. These important grants will improve our ability to create home environments that support the health of families.""
HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes promotes local efforts to eliminate dangerous lead paint and other housing-related health and safety hazards from lower income homes, stimulate private sector investment in lead hazard control, support cutting-edge research on methods for assessing and controlling housing-related health and safety hazards, and educate the public about the dangers of hazards in the home.
The grants to states and local governments, institutions of higher education, and both for-profit and nonprofit organizations are being offered through HUD's Healthy Homes Technical Studies Grant Program."

The Healthy Homes App (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gov.hud.healthyhomesbasics) is designed to raise awareness about potentially serious health and safety problems in the home and the steps consumers can take to protect themselves.
As consumers increasingly rely upon smartphones and other mobile devices to access information, this Healthy Homes app offers a convenient tool for users to learn about common health and safety risks in the home. The app provides extensive content in clear, simple language so that users can quickly understand the potential hazards throughout a home. The app also helps residents who live in condominiums, single- family detached homes, townhouses, or in apartment buildings.
""There are many potential hazards that can be found in our homes such as mold and lead based paint,"" said Michelle Miller, Acting Director of the Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes.

A series of quizzes have been included in the app to help familiarize users with the basic information on lead, indoor air quality, mold, and many other housing-related hazards. Toxins such as lead, asbestos, and household chemicals are detrimental to health in many ways. Invisible poisonous gases such as carbon monoxide and radon also pose serious threats to family health. Since most residents spend 70% or more of their time inside their home, this app was developed to provide tips on how to make and keep homes safe from health hazards.

The Housing Trust Fund is a new affordable housing production program that will complement existing Federal, state and local efforts to increase and preserve the supply of decent, safe, and sanitary affordable housing for extremely low- and very low-income households, including families experiencing homelessness.
""Today, we offer another tool to help states confront a growing affordable rental housing crisis in this country,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""The Housing Trust Fund will be an enduring resource designed to producing more housing that is affordable to our most vulnerable neighbors.""
""In today's housing market, many Americans who work hard still can't afford their rents. Affordable housing helps workers live closer to their jobs and spend more time with their families. A healthy housing market is key to vibrant communities and future economic growth, and these federal funds will help states expand the supply of affordable homes and strengthen our communities,"" said Senator Jack Reed (Rhode Island), who wrote the 2008 law establishing the National Housing Trust Fund. ""I commend HUD for making these funds available and helping states take a tailored, cost-effective approach to increasing the supply of affordable housing.""
Diane Yentel, President and Chief Executive Officer of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, added, ""Today is a historic day for millions of Americans who struggle to find affordable housing. We applaud Secretary Castro for his leadership in paving the way to make the National Housing Trust Fund a reality. We look forward to working with the administration and our state partners as we put these dollars to work building affordable homes for the lowest income people.""
Eight years after it was authorized by the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA), the Housing Trust Fund is only now being capitalized through contributions made by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In December 2014, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) directed these Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs) to begin setting aside and allocating funds to the Housing Trust. In January of 2015, HUD issued interim rules to guide states on how to implement their Housing Trust Funds.
By law, each state is allocated a minimum of $3 million. State affordable housing planners will use these funds for the following eligible activities:
Real property acquisition Site improvements and development hard costs Related soft costs Demolition Financing costs Relocation assistance Operating cost assistance for rental housing (up to 30% of each grant) Reasonable administrative and planning costs
• Real property acquisition
• Site improvements and development hard costs
• Related soft costs
• Demolition
• Financing costs
• Relocation assistance
• Operating cost assistance for rental housing (up to 30% of each grant)
• Reasonable administrative and planning costs

Read HUD's charge.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from denying or limiting housing to persons with disabilities or from refusing to make reasonable accommodations in policies or practices. This includes waiving no pet policies for assistance or service animals.
""Persons who require assistance animals have as much right to housing as anyone else and shouldn't have their requests for such accommodations unlawfully denied,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will continue to take appropriate enforcement action whenever the rights of persons with disabilities are violated.""
The case came to HUD's attention when a woman with a mental disability filed a complaint alleging that Hillside Park Real Estate, which owns the apartment complex where she sought to rent, and its property manager, discriminated against her because of her disability. Specifically, HUD's charge alleges that they denied the woman's request to keep an emotional support animal in the apartment she had contracted to rent and then cancelled her lease, even though she allegedly provided a doctor's statement attesting to her need for the accommodation.
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he or she may award damages to the complainant for her loss as a result of the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties in order to vindicate the public interest. If the case is heard in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages to the complainant.
In FY 2015, disability was the most common basis of complaints filed with HUD and its partner agencies, being cited as a basis for 4,548 complaints, or nearly 55 percent of the overall total.

The decision upheld a Final Order of the Secretary of HUD following a trial before an administrative law judge that a condominium association discriminated against a resident with disabilities by refusing to allow him to keep an emotional support animal. The First Circuit's decision is available here.
The Fair Housing Act requires that housing providers, including condominium and homeowners associations, grant reasonable accommodations to rules, policies, or practices when such accommodations are necessary to afford a person with disabilities an equal opportunity to use and enjoy housing. This includes waiving ""no pet"" rules to allow emotional support animals.
""The decision is a victory for HUD, but an even greater victory for people with disabilities,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Not only does the decision reaffirm HUD's authority to vigorously enforce the Fair Housing Act, it also reinforces the importance of protecting the rights of residents with disabilities to have the reasonable accommodations they need.""
In October 2014, HUD found that the Castillo Condominium Association, located in San Juan, Puerto Rico, violated the rights of a homeowner with disabilities by refusing to allow him to keep an emotional support animal as a reasonable accommodation to the Association's ""no pets"" policy. HUD ordered the Association to pay $20,000 in damages to the victim, who was forced to sell his condominium and find alternative housing as a result of the Association's discriminatory conduct. HUD also ordered the Association to pay a $16,000 civil penalty.
The Association appealed the order to the First Circuit. On May 2, 2016, the Court of Appeals ruled against the Association, affirming HUD's finding that the Association violated the Fair Housing Act and ordering the Association to pay the damages and penalty.
In fiscal year 2015, disability was the most common basis of fair housing complaints filed with HUD and its partner agencies, being cited as a basis for 4,548 complaints, or nearly 55 percent of the overall total.

The April rate for units in buildings with five units or more was 232,000.
EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take two months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, 4 months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2%) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90-percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised about three percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found on our web site listed above.
* 90% confidence interval includes zero. The Census Bureau does not have sufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero.

05/17/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-074.cfm,HUD Proposes Rule Requiring Installation of Broadband Technology During Construction of Most HUD-Financed Multifamily Housing,"WASHINGTON - In an effort to extend affordable internet access to children and families living in federally assisted housing, U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Julián Castro today proposed a rule to require the installation of broadband infrastructure into most HUD-financed multifamily housing developments during their construction or substantial rehabilitation. Read HUD's proposed rule, ""Narrowing the Digital Divide Through Installation of Broadband Infrastructure in HUD-Funded New Construction and Substantial Rehabilitation of Multifamily Rental Housing"" (https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-05-18/pdf/2016-11352.pdf).
Recognizing that it is generally easier and cheaper to install the necessary technology for high-speed internet at the time of construction, HUD is proposing that, when feasible, developers include these technologies in their multifamily development plans. HUD's proposed rule seeks to require that, when feasible, developers install broadband infrastructure at the time of new construction or substantial rehabilitation in multifamily rental housing that is funded or supported by HUD. Additionally, the rule will help states and local governments address the need for broadband access and climate change for low- and moderate-income residents in the communities they serve.
""By ensuring that future HUD funded properties are broadband ready, we are making long term investments in the 21st century global economy that go beyond modems and laptops,"" said Secretary Castro. ""We want to give our residents and their children the opportunity to bridge the digital divide by connecting to the world of opportunity."" said Secretary Castro.
This rule builds on ConnectHome (http://connecthome.hud.gov/), an initiative to extend affordable broadband access to families living in HUD-assisted housing. ConnectHome will ensure that high-speed Internet follows children from their classrooms back to their homes.Through this initiative, Internet Service Providers, non-profit organizations and the private sector partners offer no- or low-cost broadband access, technical training, digital literacy programs, and devices for HUD-assisted households in 28 communities across the nation.
There are two methods for submitting comments to the proposed rule published today:
• By Mail. Comments may be submitted by mail to the Regulations Division, Office of General Counsel, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 7th Street, SW, Room 10276, Washington, DC 20410-0500.
• Electronic Submission of Comments. Interested persons may submit comments electronically through the Federal eRulemaking Portal at www.regulations.gov.

In addition to formalizing many of the structural improvements announced recently, FHA's proposed rule is intended to make certain FHA-insured reverse mortgages remain a viable and sustainable resource for senior homeowners hoping to remain in their homes and age in place. Read FHA's proposed rule (https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-05-19/pdf/2016-11631.pdf).
""We've gone to great lengths to protect seniors and ensure they can remain in their homes where they've raised families and where they hope to live out their days,"" said Ed Golding, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Housing at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). ""As we grow older as a nation, we have a responsibility to ensure reverse mortgages remain a safe, secure, and sustainable financial option for future generations of senior homeowners.""
In the past two years, FHA implemented several reforms to improve its HECM Program. The proposed rule published today will reinforce those changes and add new consumer protections to make certain senior borrowers are sustained in their homes. These new changes would:
Make certain that required HECM counseling occurs before a mortgage contract is signed; Require lenders to fully disclose all HECM loan features; Cap lifetime interest rate increases on HECM Adjustable Rate Mortgages (ARMs) to five percent. Reduce the cap on annual interest rate increases on HECM ARMs from two percent to one percent; Require lenders to pay mortgage insurance premiums until the HECM is paid in full, foreclosed on, or a Deed-in-Lieu (DIL) is executed rather than until when the mortgage contract is terminated; Include utility payments in the property charge assessment; and Create a ""cash for keys"" program to encourage borrowers to complete a DIL and gracefully exit the property versus enduring a lengthy foreclosure process.

Read HUD's charge.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from denying or limiting housing to persons with disabilities or from refusing to make reasonable accommodations in policies or practices. This includes waiving pet restrictions for assistance animals.
""When property owners refuse to allow a family to have a necessary assistance animal, they are denying the family's right to fully enjoy their home. This is unacceptable and against the law,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will continue to take enforcement action whenever the rights of families or persons with disabilities are violated.""
The case came to HUD's attention when the woman filed a complaint alleging that the owners of Pinnacle Highland Apartments in Cottonwood Heights, Utah, discriminated against her family by refusing to allow her son, who has a mental disability, to keep an assistance animal. HUD's charge alleges that the woman asked that the development's ""no-pets"" policy be waived as a reasonable accommodation, but NALS Apartment Homes LLC, the property manager, denied her request.
The charge further alleges that owners and managers had discriminatory policies, including requiring tenants with disabilities who requested reasonable accommodations related to assistance animals to submit a doctor's prescription form in which the doctor indicated that the doctor's insurance carrier could be held responsible for any damages caused by the assistance animal.
The woman filed her fair housing complaint with the help of the Disability Law Center, a HUD Fair Housing Initiatives Program agency based in Salt Lake City, Utah. Disability Law Center also filed a complaint with HUD, and HUD's charge alleges that DLC was injured by respondents' allegedly discriminatory conduct across the four properties.
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he or she may award damages to the complainants for their loss as a result of the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties in order to vindicate the public interest. If the case is heard in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages to the complainant.
In FY 2015, disability was the most common basis of complaints filed with HUD and its partner agencies, being cited as a basis for 4,548 complaints, or nearly 55 percent of the overall total.

Read the agreement.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in the sale or rental of a dwelling on the basis of disability. In addition, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.
""Discriminatory practices that target persons with disabilities not only violate their rights, they lock them out of decent, safe and affordable housing,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD remains committed to taking action when property owners and managers fail to meet their obligations under the Fair Housing Act.""
The case came to HUD's attention after several individuals with mental disabilities filed complaints alleging they were denied residency at the property managed by Eden Management, LLC, due to their disabilities. The individuals filed their complaints with the assistance of HOPE Fair Housing Center, a HUD Fair Housing Initiatives Program agency in DuPage County. HOPE conducted three tests at Eden and also filed a complaint with the Department.
Under the terms of the Conciliation and Voluntary Compliance Agreement, Eden will pay Complainants $630,000, which includes relief and attorneys' fees and costs. The agreement further requires Eden to make significant policy changes, including revising its admissions manual and handbook; updating its non-discrimination statement; establishing a reasonable accommodation policy; and conducting fair housing training for employees. Furthermore, the company will develop a protocol to apply objective admissions criteria, notify all applicants of their due process rights, and refrain from asking applicants about the existence of mental disabilities or prescriptions during tours of the facility. Eden will also provide a letter to their top three referral sources encouraging individuals to apply regardless of mental disability.

Joining Secretary Castro throughout the week were Puerto Rico Governor Alejandro García Padilla and Alberto Lastra, Secretary of Housing of Puerto Rico.
While in Puerto Rico, Secretary Castro announced HUD will be investing $200 million to help develop and rehabilitate 750 units of affordable housing in seven locations across the island. The investment will be made in support of the Puerto Rico Comprehensive Housing Plan, which is a 10-year effort with the Puerto Rico Department of Housing that will ultimately develop or rehabilitate 10,000 units of housing.
""We want to send a direct message to the people of Puerto Rico: we believe in you, we believe in your future, and we want to support you as you write your comeback story,"" Secretary Castro said at the announcement event. ""The announcement represents another important step in lifting up the people of Puerto Rico. And HUD is going to continue working with the Governor, the Secretary of Housing Alberto Lastra Power, and a coalition of local leaders to do whatever it takes to get the job done. Puerto Rico is, and always should be seen as an asset to our nation's future. Let's work together to ensure that this future puts opportunity within reach of every American.""
Also joining for a portion of the visit to Puerto Rico were: Jose Calderon, President, Hispanic Federation; Robert Maldonado, President, Hispanic National Bar Association; Janet Murguia, President and CEO, National Council of La Raza; and Brent Wilkes, Executive Director, League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC). The delegation participated in briefings on Puerto Rico's debt crisis, the fight against Zika virus, and affordable housing strategies.
In an effort to learn more about Zika virus protection in public housing, Secretary Castro later visited with an expectant mother and her family living at the Residencial Ernesto Ramos Antonini housing development. In February, President Obama submitted a funding request to Congress for emergency supplemental funding to fortify the Administration's efforts to combat the virus. Congress is currently considering proposals to provide the people of Puerto Rico with resources to fight the spread of the disease.
Secretary Castro also highlighted the Obama Administration's significant efforts to address the fiscal crisis that has threatened more than three million Americans in Puerto Rico, including support for Congressional action to allow the Commonwealth to restructure its debt. This week, a bipartisan bill was introduced in Congress (H.R. 5278) as a first step toward giving Puerto Rico the tools to restructure its debt, enact fiscal reforms, and create a foundation for economic recovery after a decade of recession.
In events across Puerto Rico this week, Secretary Castro:
Toured the 74-unit Balseiro Elderly housing development and met with residents; Visited the Puerta de Tierra neighborhood and later announced $200 million in funding to support a local affordable housing strategy that will advance Puerto Rico's Comprehensive Housing Plan; Visited the Residencial Ernesto Ramos Antonini housing development in Río Piedras, Puerto Rico to meet with residents and gain a better understanding of how Zika virus protection measures, including mosquito screen installation, are impacting their families; Met with 60 young Boys and Girls Club members who live in public housing to discuss the impact of the Club on their lives. The meeting also highlighted the Administration's My Brother's Keeper initiative, which is committed to addressing persistent opportunity gaps and ensuring boys and young men of color can reach their full potential; Inaugurated the Center for Social Innovation of Puerto Rico, which will offer capacity-building and training opportunities for the Commonwealth's agencies and non-governmental entities regarding, among other activities, the implementation of community development and affordable housing programs; Met with HUD's Puerto Rico Field Office employees; Visited the San Juan National Historic Site with a group of local students to highlight President Obama's Every Kid in a Park initiative; and Met with Governor Padilla to discuss strategies to increase the supply of affordable housing, the fiscal crisis in Puerto Rico, and public health strategies on the island.

05/24/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-078.cfm,HUD and Census Bureau Report New Residential Sales in April,"WASHINGTON - Sales of new single-family houses in April 2016 were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 619,000, according to estimates released jointly today by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Census Bureau. This is 16.6 percent (±15.4%)* above the revised March rate of 531,000 and is 23.8 percent (±22.8%)* above the April 2015 estimate of 500,000.
The median sales price of new houses sold in April 2016 was $321,100; the average sales price was $379,800. The seasonally adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of April was 243,000. This represents a supply of 4.7 months at the current sales rate.
Estimates of houses sold and for sale by stage of construction are now available on a seasonally adjusted basis as well as not seasonally adjusted basis. Historic seasonally adjusted data will be available back to January 1999 at http://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/historical_data/.
New Residential Sales data for May 2016 will be released on Thursday, June 23, 2016, at 10:00 A.M. EST. Read more about new residential sales activity (www.census.gov/construction/nrs/index.html).
EXPLANATORY NOTES
These statistics are estimated from sample surveys. They are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated average relative standard errors of the preliminary data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2%) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90-percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. Changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show irregular movement. It takes 3 months to establish a trend for new houses sold. Preliminary new home sales figures are subject to revision due to the survey methodology and definitions used. The survey is primarily based on a sample of houses selected from building permits. Since a ""sale"" is defined as a deposit taken or sales agreement signed, this can occur prior to a permit being issued. An estimate of these prior sales is included in the sales figure. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimate of total sales is revised about 4 percent. Changes in sales price data reflect changes in the distribution of houses by region, size, etc., as well as changes in the prices of houses with identical characteristics. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found on our web site listed above.
* 90% confidence interval includes zero. The Census Bureau does not have sufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero."
05/27/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-079.cfm,HUD Announces Agreements with Minneapolis and St. Paul to Further Housing Choice and Opportunities for Twin Cities Residents,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced agreements with the City of Minneapolis and the City of St. Paul to further housing choice and neighborhood opportunities in the two cities and the surrounding region. The agreements will serve as the foundation to promote housing opportunities and comprehensive regional housing planning that address residential integration and segregation within Minneapolis, St. Paul and the Twin Cities metro area. Read the Minneapolis agreement. Read the St. Paul agreement.
""Families deserve real housing choice and increased opportunity to move ahead,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""These agreements place Minneapolis and St. Paul at the forefront of city and regional planning that incorporates fair housing as one of its stated goals. We look forward to working with the Twin Cities as they establish their goals and take steps to meet them.""
Under the agreements, the city of Minneapolis and the city of St. Paul will move forward on plans to revise a regional fair housing analysis within a year, taking advantage of new tools provided through HUD's Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing Rule. The cities' analysis will identify barriers that affect the rights of fair housing choice within the cities' jurisdictions and region, including patterns of integration and segregation, racially or ethnically concentrated areas of poverty, and disparities in access to opportunity and disproportionate housing needs, with no admissions of liability.
The agreement with Minneapolis resolves a complaint filed with HUD in 2015 by the Metropolitan Interfaith Council on Affordable Housing, the Webber-Camden Neighborhood Organization, the Whittier Alliance, and the Folwell Neighborhood Association. The agreement with St. Paul resolves a complaint filed with HUD in 2015 by the Metropolitan Interfaith Council on Affordable Housing. The organizations claimed that the cities, which receive HUD community development and affordable housing funds, failed to comply with all of HUD's civil rights requirements, including the obligation to affirmatively further fair housing. All parties concur that the settlement announced today resolves the complaints.
The parties agreed to participate in a regional fair housing planning process funded in part by HUD and will retain a consultant to conduct the revised fair housing analysis. The process will include the establishment of an advisory committee to help HUD, the cities and other jurisdictions in the region ensure that key stakeholders, including Minneapolis, St. Paul and the complainants, participate in the process.
The cities' revised analysis will be used in Minneapolis' and St. Paul's 2015-2019 Consolidated Plans to demonstrate the cities' commitment to affirmatively further fair housing. The analysis will also be developed as part of a regional analysis in conjunction with other HUD-funded communities in the Twin Cities Region.
People who believe they have experienced housing discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed at www.hud.gov/fairhousing or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, which can be accessed through Apple and Android devices."
05/31/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-080.cfm,HUD Proposes New Formula for Indian Housing Block Grant Program,"WASHINGTON - After three years of negotiation with federally and state recognized tribes across the country, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today proposed a new formula to be used to allocate funds through the Department's Indian Housing Block Grant (IHBG) Program. Read HUD's proposed rule (https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-05-31/pdf/2016-12596.pdf).
The Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 (NAHASDA) requires HUD to update IHBG's formula periodically through a negotiated rulemaking process with grant recipients. HUD negotiated the proposed rule with active tribal participation and using the procedures of the Negotiated Rulemaking Act of 1990. As a result of this process, and after a year-long study of potential data sources to be used in this formula, the Negotiated Rulemaking Committee succeeded in reaching consensus on most issues that were discussed. The proposed rule announced today reflects HUD's decisions for both consensus and non-consensus issues, with the intention of improving and clarifying the current regulations. The notice calls for comments to be submitted by August 1, 2016.
The IHBG Program is the single largest source of affordable housing assistance in Native American communities. Over the life of the program, recipients built or acquired nearly 37,000 affordable homes and have rehabilitated more than 77,000 others.
The IHBG allocations are distributed each year to eligible Indian tribes or their tribally designated housing entities for a range of affordable housing activities. Through the program, HUD provides federal housing assistance for Indian tribes in a manner that recognizes the right of Indian self-determination and tribal self-government. In February, HUD announced more than $660 million in grant allocations to 587 Native American tribes in 35 states for fiscal year 2016. The funds benefit low-income families living on Indian reservations or in other American Indian and Alaska Native communities. The amount of each grant is based on a formula that considers local needs and housing units under management by the tribe or designated entity.
Eligible activities for the funds include housing development, assistance to housing developed under the Indian Housing Program of the 1937 Housing Act, housing services to eligible families and individuals, housing management services, crime prevention and safety, and HUD-approved model activities that provide creative approaches to solving affordable housing problems. The block grant approach to housing was enabled by the Native American Housing Assistance and Self Determination Act of 1996 (NAHASDA)."
06/01/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-081.cfm,HUD Kicks Off National Homeownership Month,"WASHINGTON - This week, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) kicks off National Homeownership Month by recognizing how homeownership enhances lives and contributes to thriving communities we call home. ""Dare to Own the Dream"" is the theme of this month-long recognition, reinforcing the long-held belief that owning a home remains one of the cornerstones of the American Dream
When President Obama took office nearly eight years ago, the nation's housing market was in free-fall, unemployment was rising and many families were left feeling trapped and anxious about their mortgages. He immediately took action to address these issues and to protect the middle class. The steps he took helped millions of Americans stay in their homes, save money on their mortgages and turn their communities around.
""Homeownership Month is a good time to reflect on the progress the Obama Administration has made to ensure that owning a home is always within the grasp of the average American family. A home is the place where we raise our children, establish roots in a community and plan our future,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""The opportunity to be a homeowner should be open to those ready and able to buy a home. As the housing market continues its recovery we must ensure that responsible homeowners have access to credit to make their dreams of homeownership a reality.""
Over the course of its 82-year history, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) stimulated nearly $4 trillion in mortgage capital into our economy and helped more than 44 million Americans to become homeowners. Today, FHA continues to build the middle class and open doors for underserved families.
Since its roots during the Great Depression, FHA is leveling the playing field for all Americans who can reasonably purchase a home by ensuring affordable access to credit for underserved borrowers. In January 2015, FHA lowered its mortgage insurance premiums (MIP) because too many families were priced out of homeownership. As of March 31, 2016, FHA has endorsed approximately 1.3 million loans under the new reduced MIP. This price reduction is projected to save more than two million FHA homeowners an average of $900 annually and spur 250,000 new homebuyers to purchase their first home.
Throughout the month of June, HUD will host a series of Twitter chats to discuss three important topics surrounding homeownership and FHA. Follow these chats with #OwntheDream:
Are you ready for homeownership? How to know if an FHA loan is right for you. Is housing counseling for you?
• Are you ready for homeownership?
• How to know if an FHA loan is right for you.
• Is housing counseling for you?"
06/01/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-083.cfm,HUD Administrative Law Judge Rules Against Minnesota Landlord Charged with Discriminating Against Persons with Disabilities,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced that a HUD Administrative Law Judge ruled against a northern Minnesota landlord charged with refusing to rent an apartment to prospective tenants because of their disabilities. Landlord Deane Woodard of Detroit Lakes, Minnesota was ordered to pay $27,000 to one woman, a $16,000 civil penalty, and $1,000 in other court sanctions. Read the ruling.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in the sale or rental of a dwelling on the basis of disability. Housing providers may not refuse to rent to persons with disabilities.
""Refusing to rent to someone simply because they have a disability is not only wrong, it's illegal,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""This order sends a clear message to housing providers that HUD remains committed to ensuring that they abide by the nation's fair housing laws.""
In August 2015, HUD charged property manager Deane Woodard with making discriminatory statements to a prospective tenant and her roommate, and refusing to rent a home in Detroit Lakes, Minnesota to them because they have mental disabilities. In an order earlier this year, the Administrative Law Judge found that Woodard had violated the Fair Housing Act. Prior to learning about the prospective tenants' mental disabilities, he had agreed to rent to them and had even provided them with a key to the house. However, when the woman, her parents, and her roommate drove to the house to give the manager a security deposit and begin the process of moving in, Mr. Woodard told the group that the woman and her friend could not rent the property because of their disabilities. Among other statements, the manager told the women that the owner ""did not want a bipolar in the house.""
In addition to damages and penalties, the order bars the manager from discriminating against future applicants because they have disabilities and requires him to take fair housing training.
Disability remains the most common basis of housing discrimination complaints filed with HUD and its partner agencies. Last year alone, HUD received 4,548 disability-related complaints, or nearly 55 percent of all complaints.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to www.hud.gov/fairhousing, or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, which can be accessed through Apple and Android devices."
06/01/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-084.cfm,HUD Names New Housing Counseling Federal Advisory Committee,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today named 12 persons who will constitute the first-ever Housing Counseling Federal Advisory Committee (HCFAC). Established under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, this advisory panel will help HUD's Office of Housing Counseling improve upon all the efforts to provide consumers with the knowledge they need to make informed and lasting housing decisions.
Last April, HUD solicited nominations to serve on the first-ever federal advisory committee. Those selected hail from among mortgage, real estate, consumer and housing counseling sectors. They include:

Read brief bios of the HCFAC members.
The Housing Counseling Federal Advisory Committee will explore new opportunities to expand access to HUD housing counseling programs, develop new innovative strategies to support community-based counseling agencies, and identify methods to leverage our resources to amplify the impact of federally funded housing counseling. This panel will also develop new metrics to evaluate the health and capacity of the housing counseling industry, specifically in the context of disaster recovery and identify ways to improve the use of technology in housing counseling.
By teaching consumers basic principles of housing and money management, HUD's network of approximately 2,000 HUD-approved housing counseling agencies help families to improve their financial situation, address their current housing needs, and pursue their housing and financial goals over time. Housing counselors increase awareness of both rights and responsibilities of homeownership and rental tenancy, addressing fundamental concepts such as anti-discrimination laws, the types of ownership and tenancy, budgeting, affordability calculations, maintenance and upkeep responsibilities, eviction and homelessness prevention, and where to get help when future housing challenges arise. Housing counselors provide support to households facing unemployment, finding and maintaining housing after returning from military deployment, or moving their families because their current housing situation is unsustainable.
There are many ways to find a HUD-approved housing counseling agency. Visit HUD's website or call 1-800-569-4287 for our interactive telephone directory.

06/02/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-082.cfm,"HUD and VA Team Up to Find Permanent Homes for 5,200 Veterans Experiencing Homelessness","WASHINGTON - To help end veteran homelessness, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) are awarding nearly $38 million to help more than 5,200 homeless veterans find a permanent place to call home. The rental assistance announced today is provided through the HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) Program which combines rental assistance from HUD with case management and clinical services provided by VA.
HUD-VASH works in reducing veteran homelessness because it provides funding for both the housing and supportive services that are essential for ending homelessness for tens of thousands of veterans nationwide. See the local impact of the housing assistance announced today.
HUD-VASH is an important part of the Obama Administration's efforts to provide critical housing and services to veterans experiencing homelessness. This effort also includes HUD's Homeless Assistance Programs, as well as VA's Supportive Services for Veteran Families (SSVF) and Grant and Per Diem (GPD) programs.
""Supporting the brave men and women who served our nation is not only our honor but also our responsibility,"" said Secretary Julián Castro. ""Joining the more than 111,000 formerly homeless veterans who have already found homes through this successful program, thousands more brave veterans will be able to start a new chapter in their lives. It's a privilege to partner with communities dedicated to ensuring that no veteran has to call the streets their home.""
""Community by community, we're making significant progress preventing and ending homelessness among Veterans,"" said Secretary of Veterans Affairs Robert A. McDonald. ""The housing voucher awards announced today will provide thousands of the most vulnerable Veterans with access to affordable housing from HUD and wraparound services from VA so that each one can become and remain stably housed.""
Since 2008, more than 79,000 vouchers have been awarded and over 111,000 homeless veterans have been served through the HUD-VASH program. Rental assistance and supportive services provided through HUD-VASH are a critical resource for local communities in ending homelessness among our nation's Veterans.
Additionally, Opening Doors: Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness (http://www.usich.gov/PDF/FactSheetVeterans.pdf) serves as a roadmap for how the federal government will work with state and local communities to confront the root causes of homelessness, especially among former servicemen and women. To support communities as they progress towards the goal of ending veteran homelessness, USICH has identified strategies that increase collaboration and coordination among programs serving veterans experiencing homelessness.
In the HUD-VASH program, VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) assess veterans experiencing homelessness before referring them to local housing agencies for these vouchers. Decisions are based on a variety of factors, most importantly the duration of homelessness and the need for longer term, more intensive support in obtaining and maintaining permanent housing. The HUD-VASH program includes both the rental assistance the voucher provides and the comprehensive case management that VAMC staff offers.
Veterans participating in the HUD-VASH program rent privately owned housing and generally contribute no more than 30 percent of their income toward rent. VA offers eligible homeless veterans clinical and supportive services through its medical centers across the U.S., Guam, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands."
06/06/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-085.cfm,Obama Administration Names Final Round of Promise Zone Communities,"WASHINGTON - The Obama Administration today named the final nine Promise Zones across the country - high poverty areas in select urban, rural and tribal communities. Through the Promise Zone Initiative, the Federal government will work strategically with local leaders to boost economic activity and job growth, improve educational opportunities, reduce crime and leverage private investment to improve the quality of life in these vulnerable areas.
The following communities now include Promise Zones:
• Atlanta, Georgia
• Nashville, Tennessee
• Evansville, Indiana
• South Los Angeles, California
• San Diego, California
• Southwest Florida Regional Planning Commission
• Spokane Tribe of Indians, Washington
• Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians, Rolette County, North Dakota
• Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Julián Castro traveled to Atlanta to make the announcement while U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Tom Vilsack announced the new Promise Zone in Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico on Friday. In addition, a host of other senior Administration officials made individual announcements in the other Promise Zones.
""Promise Zones bring the power of partnership to a whole new level as we seek to bring opportunity to neighborhoods long locked out of their area's prosperity,"" said HUD Secretary Castro. ""As a former mayor from a city that includes a Promise Zone, I know just how powerful these collaborations are when it comes to building stronger, economically vital neighborhoods.""
""Rural and Tribal areas face unique challenges and we are ready to take on those challenges with creative solutions that strengthen communities,"" said USDA Secretary Vilsack. ""The Promise Zone initiative delivers proven results by encouraging collaboration between the federal government, community organizations, the private sector and state and local governments. Through these partnerships, we are supporting jobs and economic opportunities that enable rural areas to thrive.""
Background on Promise Zones:
Today's newly designated Promise Zones join 13 others that President Obama designated in 2014 and 2015. These Promise Zones include targeted neighborhoods in the following communities:
• San Antonio, Texas
• Los Angeles, California
• Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
• Southeastern Kentucky Highlands
• the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma
• Camden, New Jersey
• Hartford, Connecticut
• Indianapolis, Indiana
• Minneapolis, Minnesota
• Sacramento, California
• St. Louis/St. Louis County, Missouri
• Pine Ridge Indian Reservation of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, South Dakota
• The South Carolina Low Country
Work is well underway in these communities and demonstrating results. For example:
In Indianapolis, the IndyEast Promise Zone has already secured nearly $10 million in federal grants across seven different agencies. This support has helped create 110 jobs, provide life-changing workforce training to hundreds of formerly incarcerated individuals, and develop a new energy efficient apartment building for low-income senior citizens. In North Minneapolis, USDA awarded Appetite for Change (a locally led organization) a Community Food Project grant to help continue and expand programs that are changing the way food is produced, marketed, distributed and consumed in North Minneapolis. This project has served over 1,000 community members, with 24 youth employed and trained and 15 jobs created, aiding 53 community-owned food business start-ups. In San Antonio, the Promise Zone to Work Initiative was launched and has since provided free job training certifications in nursing, construction, manufacturing, information technology, and heavy equipment for 106 residents. This effort is contributing to an overall decline in the unemployment rate; over the last four years, unemployment in the Promise Zone declined from 15 percent to 11 percent. In Southeastern KY, a new educational framework and support from AmeriCorps VISTA members helped lift the graduation rate at Leslie County High School from 67 to 98 percent. Choctaw Nation: secured $21 million in New Markets Tax Credits to build an environmentally sustainable steel manufacturing facility in the Promise Zone. The mill will support approximately 300 new jobs in the region.

Additional information on rural and Tribal Promise Zones is available at www.usda.gov/promisezones.
Today's Promise Zone communities were selected from 82 applications from 38 states and Puerto Rico. Each urban, rural, and tribal Promise Zone applicant was asked to put together a clear description of how the Promise Zone designation would accelerate and strengthen the community's own efforts at comprehensive community revitalization. Each Promise Zone will be coordinated by a lead community based organization in partnership with the Obama Administration. HUD will be the federal lead for the five urban designees, while USDA will serve as the lead federal partner to the tribal and rural Promise Zones.
All Promise Zones will receive priority access to federal investments that further their strategic plans, federal staff on the ground to help them implement their goals, and five full-time AmeriCorps VISTA members to recruit and manage volunteers and strengthen the capacity of the Promise Zone initiatives.

06/09/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-087.cfm,HUD Declares June First National Healthy Homes Month,"WASHINGTON - Most Americans spend up to 90 percent of their time indoors, exposing them to home health and safety hazards ranging from asthma triggers to potentially deadly pollutants like asbestos and lead-based paint. To reinforce the connection between a family's health and their homes, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is declaring this June as the first-ever National Healthy Homes Month. Launched by HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes (OLHCHH), this month is designed to educate families of potential health hazards in a home, and empower them to create the healthiest home possible for their family.
This year's theme is ""Everyone Deserves a Safe and Healthy Home,"" recognizing that people spend most of their time inside, and introduces them to healthy homes concepts while providing tips for keeping homes healthy and safe.
""National Healthy Homes Month calls attention to the fact that health and home safety are attainable for all,"" said Michelle Miller, Acting Director of HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes. ""We are working closely with our federal partners, and many other organizations, to highlight the dangers of residential hazards to everyone, but especially children and other vulnerable populations in low income households.""
To help celebrate the month and to address today's pressing home health issues, HUD and the National Environmental Health Association (NEHA) are co-hosting an annual National Healthy Homes Educational Conference from June 13-16, 2016 in San Antonio. The State of Big Ideas: Moving Environmental Health Outside the Box (http://neha.org/aec) conference will gather 1,200 environmental health and healthy housing professionals for an in-depth look at some of the most important issues facing the nation such as water quality, healthy housing and communities, asthma, emergency preparedness and more.
Currently, millions of American homes have moderate-to-severe physical housing problems, including lead-based paint hazards, dilapidated structure; roofing problems; heating, plumbing, and electrical deficiencies; water leaks and intrusion; pests; damaged paint; and high radon gas levels. These conditions are associated with a wide range of health issues, including unintentional injuries, respiratory illnesses like asthma and radon-induced lung cancer.
National Healthy Homes Month 2016 will focus national attention on ways to keep people of all ages safe and healthy in their homes. To mark this month-long campaign, HUD Secretary Julián Castro, produced a video highlighting the direct link between a household's health and the conditions within their homes.

06/13/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-089.cfm,"HUD Announces New Lead-Safe Homes, Lead-Free Kids Toolkit","WASHINGTON - The devastating effects of lead poisoning are irreversible, and even low levels of lead in a young child's blood can have long-term effects on their ability to learn and lead a productive life. To prevent these life-long effects and strengthen protections for families living in HUD-assisted housing, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Julián Castro today announced The Lead-Safe Homes, Lead-Free Kids Toolkit.
HUD has a long history of working to ensure lead-safe housing, which fits into the broader federal response to address lead hazards found in other sources like water, soil, or consumer goods. For more than 20 years, HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes has worked to improve ways to identify and address home-related health and safety hazards, including lead. Since 1993, HUD has awarded more than $1.58 billion in grants to communities for identification and control of lead-based paint hazards in more than 190,000 low-income privately owned housing units. In addition, HUD continues to support research on best practices for identifying and controlling lead-based paint hazards.
Announced today at the HUD-National Environmental Health Association annual conference in San Antonio, Texas, this comprehensive toolkit builds upon HUD's decades-long commitment to safe, affordable housing. This toolkit provides both immediate actions and a long-term vision to address lead in homes both through immediate changes to HUD programs and legislative proposals that would give HUD needed authority to ensure all HUD housing is lead-safe.
""The health and safety of the families we serve is our first priority,"" said Secretary Castro. ""Sadly, decades' worth of lead hazards in homes continues to put families and young children at risk. As a leader in lead-safe housing, we know there's still more work to be done. We're proud to introduce this toolkit so we can better ensure children and their families have a safe, healthy place to call home.""
""Too many children are still being exposed to lead through soil and paint in their homes, and I welcome HUD's efforts to address lead hazards and ensure more children get the testing and support they need. Now, Congress must also step up to ensure that we are investing in comprehensive efforts to combat lead exposure whether in water, homes, or any source,"" said U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown (Ohio).
""I applaud Secretary Castro and the Department of Housing and Urban Development for taking action to protect kids and families from lead hazards,"" Congressman Dan Kildee(Michigan) said. ""There is no safe level of lead, especially for children under the age of six, yet lead hazards still exist in many communities across the country. These new federal resources will help to remove lead-based hazards from thousands of homes and educate people about ways they can protect their family.""
Today, HUD will also award more than $46.5 million in Lead Hazard Reduction Demonstration grants to 15 local and state government agencies to protect children and families from the hazards of lead-based paint and from other home health and safety hazards. The grant funding will reduce lead-based paint hazards in more than 3,100 low-income homes.
""Lead poisoning poses a very serious health threat, particularly in New England where our housing stock is older than in most other states,"" said U.S. Senator Susan Collins (Maine). ""I have worked to raise awareness about this dangerous and too often unseen problem since the beginning of my service in the U.S. Senate. As the Chairman of the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Subcommittee, I have successfully secured robust funding for lead abatement programs. This $3.4 million grant provided to the Maine State Housing Authority is excellent news and will help ensure that hundreds of Maine families have safe and healthy homes.""
The century-old legacy of lead in house paint continues to present a hazard, particularly for low-income families in privately owned homes. Exposure to lead, including deteriorated paint, dust, and soil presents a risk to millions of Americans living in housing built before 1978, including some HUD-assisted residents. Lead poisoning is associated with learning and behavior problems in children and high blood pressure in adults.
To strengthen protections for families living in HUD-assisted housing, HUD's toolkit aims to:
Strengthen regulatory framework and monitoring by proposing revisions to HUD's Lead Safe Housing Rule, which, when issued, will align the child blood lead level requiring response with the Centers for Disease Control's (CDC) recommended level. Identify and address known lead hazards through increased monitoring, improved local reporting and guidance by increasing monitoring and enforcement of the Lead Safe Housing Rule and the Lead Disclosure Rule, as well as clarifying HUD guidance about these rules to Public Housing Agencies, owners of HUD-assisted housing, and HUD grantees. Work with Administration partners to encourage an interagency focus on addressing lead hazard prevention for both paint and other sources. Provide education and targeted outreach to increase awareness of lead by HUD families, housing providers, local governments, and other key stakeholders, and work with health departments to make available blood lead level testing to all children under age six in HUD-assisted homes. Conduct research to identify best practices and determine where best to target federal resources by studying the effectiveness of HUD grantees' use of formula grants to address lead issues.

Other key features of this toolkit include efforts to improve the process to identify and control lead hazards before children are sickened and strengthen monitoring of HUD-assisted housing. The toolkit also builds on HUD's work by facilitating partnerships among HUD and other federal agencies to develop a consistent standard for and response to water quality issues in HUD-assisted housing.
HUD's key federal partners share an extensive history of work to prevent lead exposure. For nearly 30 years, the CDC's Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program has developed programs and policies to prevent childhood lead poisoning and provided funding to state and local health departments to determine the extent of childhood lead poisoning. Since its inception, CDC has funded nearly 60 childhood lead poisoning prevention programs to develop, implement, and evaluate lead poisoning prevention activities.
This National Healthy Homes Month focuses national attention on ways to keep people of all ages safe and healthy in their homes. To mark this month-long campaign, Secretary Castro, produced a video highlighting the direct link between a household's health and the conditions within their homes.

06/13/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-090.cfm,HUD Awards $46.5 Million to Make Thousands of Homes Safe from Lead and Other Home Hazards,"WASHINGTON - To protect children and families from the hazards of lead-based paint and other home health and safety hazards, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today awarded $46.5 million in grants to 15 local and state governments (see chart below).
The grant funding announced today will reduce the number of lead-poisoned children and protect families by targeting health hazards in over 3,100 low-income homes with significant lead and/or other home health and safety hazards. The Lead Hazard Reduction Demonstration grant program has a demonstrated history of success, filling critical needs in urban communities where no other resources exist to address substandard housing that threatens the health of the most vulnerable residents. Read a summary of each of the grants announced today.
As HUD celebrates this June as the first ever National Healthy Homes Month, HUD Secretary Julián Castro is focused on helping children and families secure quality housing by protecting them from the hazards of lead-based paint and other home health and safety hazards.
""As the leader in lead paint hazard control, HUD's grant awards are one of our strongest efforts to prevent lead poisoning among children,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""These awards will help clean up lead paint hazards in thousands of low-income homes across the nation, eliminating the sources of permanent health and behavioral problems that lead poisoning brings.""
Unsafe and unhealthy homes affect the health of millions of people of all income levels, geographic areas, and walks of life in the U.S. These homes affect the economy directly, through increased use of health care services, and indirectly through lost wages and increased school days missed. Housing improvements help prevent injuries and illnesses, reduce associated health care and social services costs, reduce absentee rates for children in school and adults at work, and reduce stress, all which help to improve the quality of life.
HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes promotes local efforts to eliminate dangerous lead paint and other housing-related health and safety hazards from lower income homes, stimulates private sector investment in lead hazard control, supports cutting-edge research on methods for assessing and controlling housing-related health and safety hazards, and educates the public about the dangers of hazards in the home.
The funding announced today directs critical funds to cities, counties and states to eliminate dangerous lead paint and other housing-related health hazards in thousands of privately-owned, low-income housing units. HUD is also providing these Lead Hazard Reduction Demonstration program grantees over $4.5 million in Healthy Homes supplemental funding to help these communities mitigate multiple health hazards in high risk housing simultaneously, in conjunction with their lead hazard control activities.

06/14/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-088.cfm,HUD and Justice Department Award $9.2 Million to Provide Stable Housing to Victims of Domestic Violence Living with HIV/AIDS,"WASHINGTON - To help prevent victims of domestic violence living with HIV/AIDS from falling into homelessness, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) today announced more than $9 million to support eight local programs across the country working to protect and house these victims.
DOJ's Office on Violence Against Women and HUD's Office of HIV/AIDS Housing collaborated to provide these grants under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) and HUD's Housing Opportunities for Persons With AIDS (HOPWA) Program. During today's White House United State of Women Summit, the following grantees were announced:
Read a summary of each grantee.
HUD Secretary Julián Castro said, ""Every person, especially those fighting the effects of HIV/AIDS or looking to escape an abusive situation, deserves to live in a safe and stable environment. Through this collaborative effort with the Justice Department, we're able to help those living at the intersection of HIV/AIDS and domestic violence to secure the housing and health services they need to build a better future.""
""This joint effort will help low-income individuals with HIV/AIDS who have survived domestic violence secure the vital services they need to reclaim their lives and restore their futures,"" said Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch. ""The Justice Department is committed to safeguarding the rights and opportunities of all Americans, including the most vulnerable among us. And in the days ahead, we will continue our work to ensure that every American - from every background - has the safety, security, and support that they deserve.""
Through this demonstration program, HUD will provide funding for housing assistance and supportive services to low-income persons living with HIV/AIDS who are victims of sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, or stalking. Grantees are required to form partnerships between local HIV housing and service providers and domestic violence and sexual assault service providers for client outreach and engagement and for comprehensive supportive services to ensure client success in the program. Descriptions of the funded projects can be found here.
This demonstration follows a recommendation by the Federal Interagency Working Group on the Intersection of HIV/AIDS, Violence against Women and Girls, and Gender-Related Health Disparities to enhance Federal efforts in addressing HIV and intimate partner violence (IPV) among homeless and marginally housed women and girls. While the Working Group focuses on women and girls, the housing assistance and supportive services provided through the demonstration will be open to all eligible clients regardless of sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, familial status, marital status, race, color, religion, national origin, disability, or age.
Since 1992, the HUD's HOPWA Program, managed by the Office of HIV/AIDS Housing, has provided national leadership and resources that support the development and operation of high-quality supportive housing programs. Under the HOPWA Program, HUD makes grants to cities, states, and nonprofit organizations to provide housing assistance and supportive services to low-income persons living with HIV/AIDS and their families. By providing assistance with housing and related services, the HOPWA program helps persons living with HIV/AIDS enter into housing, access and remain in medical care, and adhere to complex treatment regimens. More information on the HOPWA program is available at https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/hopwa/.
The Justice Department's Office on Violence Against Women (OVW), headed by Principal Deputy Director Bea Hanson, provides leadership in developing the nation's capacity to reduce violence against women through the implementation of VAWA and subsequent legislation. Created in 1995, OVW administers financial and technical assistance to communities across the country that are developing programs, policies and practices aimed at ending domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault and stalking.

06/15/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-092.cfm,HUD Proposes New Rule to Expand Choice and Opportunity for Section 8 Voucher Holders in Certain Housing Markets,"WASHINGTON - More than two million American households depend upon the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) Program to find suitable affordable rental housing. Yet in some metropolitan areas, the choices these families have about where they live are severely limited, placing high-opportunity neighborhoods out of reach, in part because of the current method of calculating their rental assistance. Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is proposing a new method to recalculate rental subsidies in a manner that would expand neighborhood options for households living in these particularly restrictive housing markets.
For the next 60 days, HUD is accepting public comment on a proposal to change the geography it uses to calculate so-called Fair Market Rents (FMRs). In these areas, HUD is proposing to transition from a metropolitan area-wide approach to setting FMRs down to the zip code level as a means to expand the options these families have to live in lower poverty neighborhoods. If instituted today, this 'Small Area Fair Market Rent' approach would impact 31 metropolitan areas (see list below, though the final list may change). Read HUD's Proposed Rule (www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-06-16/pdf/2016-13939.pdf).
""In some areas of the country, the Housing Choice Voucher Program offers little choice to families about where they can live, limiting opportunities for themselves and their children,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""We propose to use a tested new approach that would offer these households greater choice to move into higher opportunity neighborhoods with better housing, better schools and higher paying jobs.""
HUD's Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research Katherine M. O'Regan added, ""What we propose today will offer real choice to voucher-assisted families. It's clear that our current approach to supporting more options isn't working in many areas. There is strong evidence that calculating rental subsidies at the zip code level is a more effective way of promoting choice in concentrated rental markets.""
Background
Fair Market Rents (FMRs) are gross rent estimates that are used to calculate the maximum subsidy HUD provides families receiving rental assistance, including the 2.2 million households assisted through the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) Program. These households generally contribute 30 percent of their adjusted monthly income toward their rent with the rental subsidy paying the rest. FMRs are usually set at the 40th percentile of all rents charged in an entire metropolitan area; although in 2000, HUD began to set this rent standard to the 50th percentile in areas where voucher families were highly concentrated.
The main objective of the 50th percentile program was to provide a broader range of housing choices that would enable voucher holders to move to areas of higher opportunity. However, research indicates that rather than incentivizing voucher holders to move to higher opportunity neighborhoods, most of the additional subsidies provided through this approach appear to benefit landlords in the form of higher rents - in effect, artificially inflating rents in some higher poverty neighborhoods. HUD is proposing to phase out the 50thpercentile program over the next three years and to calculate FMRs by zip codes within qualifying metropolitan areas as a mechanism to expand the choices available to these households. This Small Area Fair Market Rent approach is intended to increase voucher holders' access to a greater number of units in low poverty areas while reducing excess subsidy from some high poverty neighborhoods.
In metropolitan areas where there is a wide variance in the rents being charged to tenants and where voucher holders are concentrated in a few high-poverty neighborhoods, HUD is proposing to calculate FMRs based upon the rents being charged by the zip codes within that area. This permits FMRs and the resulting payment standards to be higher in low-poverty/high-rent areas, and lower in high-poverty/low-rent areas.
The following Metropolitan Areas currently meet the Proposed Rule's threshold of voucher concentration and potential for SAFMRs to be effective, and thus would be required to institute this new approach. (This list may change by the time of implementation):

Last year, a group of Harvard University social scientists published a study based largely on HUD data. This report sought to measure the long-term effects of moving families away from neighborhoods with deeply concentrated poverty to low-poverty environments and to gauge the impact these moves had on the overall well-being of these families. The authors found that children who moved to low-poverty neighborhoods when they were young are doing better as adults, with significantly higher earnings and a greater likelihood of having attended college. Findings from this new study, along with HUD's own research, support the Department's current policy direction of fostering opportunities for economic mobility while also investing in place-based strategies that revitalize distressed neighborhoods.

06/15/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-093.cfm,2016 HUD Secretary's Award for Healthy Homes Winners Announced,"WASHINGTON - Recognized for their excellence in promoting resident health through housing interventions, three model programs in Massachusetts, Washington and California are winners of the second annual HUD Secretary's Award for Healthy Homes (www.huduser.gov/portal/about/AwardForHealthy_Homes2015_1.html). The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the National Environmental Health Association (NEHA) selected:
• Boston Residential Investigation on Green and Healthy Transitions (BRIGHT) in Boston, Massachusetts;
• Yesler Terrace Breathe Easy Program in Seattle, Washington;
• Regional Asthma Management Program in Oakland, California
Today, the awards were presented at the NEHA 2016 AEC and HUD Healthy Homes Conference (http://neha.org/news-events/aec-and-hud-healthy-homes-conference) in San Antonio, Texas. Each awardee demonstrated that their activities or policies showed measurable benefits in the health of lower income residents.
""Through collaboration and evidence-based policy, these organizations are creating sustainable environments where families are healthy and thriving"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""I applaud the winners for their commitment to sparking innovative development in their communities, and I look forward to our continued work together in making American city's places of big dreams and possibilities.""
The 2016 HUD Secretary's Healthy Homes Award recognizes excellence in healthy housing innovation and achievement in three categories:
Healthy Homes Innovation and Achievement in Cross Sector Coordination among Health, Environment and Housing:
Yesler Terrace Breathe Easy Program - The Seattle Housing Authority (SHA) launched the Yesler Breathe Easy Program in 2015 to bring healthy homes and vibrancy to an old public housing development originally built for low-income families and to provide one-on-one visits from trained community health workers. The program is a product of multiple interventions the SHA has proven to be effective over a decade of redevelopment. The program uses evidence based practices to make gains in improving resident health, especially to those suffering from asthma and other respiratory illnesses. The Yesler Breathe Easy Program has brought two brand new affordable multifamily residential buildings to Yesler Terrace that integrate innovative programming and healthy living and plans to bring more in the next five years. Each building incorporates design features which protect residents from dust and pollutants that contribute to an unequal burden of respiratory disease.
Healthy Homes Innovation and Achievement in Public Policy:
Regional Asthma Management Program - The Regional Management Program (RAMP), in partnership with the California Healthy Housing Coalition (CHHC), has become an advocate for healthy housing conditions and respiratory health in California state policy and housing practices. RAMP's strong relationships and collaborations with healthy housing stakeholders and CHHC, along with their development of strategic, innovative approaches to state policy advocacy makes the program a champion for health and environmental sustainability. The coalition first developed and passed a series of legislation over a period of three years to help transform the approach landlords and code enforcement officers take to infestations, and secondly helped make California the first state in the country to explicitly make mold an enforceable substandard housing condition.
Healthy Homes Innovation and Achievement in Public Housing/ Multifamily Supported Housing:
Boston Residential Investigation on Green and Healthy Transitions (BRIGHT) - The Boston Residential Investigation on Green and Healthy Transitions (BRIGHT) is an ongoing, collaborative effort to measure the effect of redevelopment projects on three public housing developments moving toward environmental sustainability. BRIGHT study teams administered a health survey and conducted both environmental samples and visual inspections to determine the success of the city's strategic sustainability plans. Results show significant reductions in pests, mold, and inadequate ventilation. One year later, BRIGHT study teams continue to quantify a variety of metrics including energy savings, air quality, prevalence of asthma, energy and water consumption, work order requests, and resident health and satisfaction. This initiative is a one of many that the Boston Housing Authority has undertaken over the past 15 years to institutionalize healthy, green principles into their housing policies and business practices."

Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2%) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90-percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised about three percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found on our web site listed above.
* 90% confidence interval includes zero. The Census Bureau does not have sufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero.

06/17/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-096.cfm,"HUD, Housing Authorities Celebrate Father's Day","WASHINGTON - To help celebrate Father's Day,the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is encouraging communities to support dads living in HUD assisted housing to stay connected with their children by participating in HUD's National Father's Day Initiative and hosting events to celebrate fatherhood and family.
In celebration of HUD's National Father's Day 2016 throughout the month of June over 600 Public Housing Authorities and Multi-Family ownerswill host Father's Day events. For the sixth consecutive year, events will provide men with the opportunity to connect with resources that will allow them to become employed and continue regular engagement with their kids.
The Father's Day Initiative is a part of a larger Obama Administration effort to promote responsible fatherhood. The National Conversation on Responsible Fatherhood and Strong Communities (www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ofbnp/policy/fatherhood) focuses on fatherhood and at-risk youth. HUD is committed to this effort and addressing persistent opportunity gaps facing boys and young men of color and ensuring all young people reach their full potential.
""Fathers have an important role to play in strengthening our communities and leading our next generation of leaders. As a dad, I am personally committed to helping fathers, who receive HUD assistance, become more engaged and find the resources needed to improve their lives, strengthen and empower the entire family,"" said HUD Secretary Castro. ""HUD is proud to work with our local partners and families to build futures full of love and opportunity.""
Many local housing authorities and multifamily properties will use Saturday, June 18th - the day before Father's Day - to celebrate fatherhood and the importance of dads being connected with their children who live in public housing or surrounding communities, but others will be conducting activities throughout the month of June. The events have a two-fold purpose: Offering activities for fathers to do with their children while connecting these men to economic development resources. Additionally, some housing authorities link HUD's National Father's Day initiative with science,
technology, engineering and math (STEM) initiatives that help low-income children who live in public housing get involved with STEM activities while spending time with their fathers.
Local offices of other federal agencies, including the U.S. Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services (HHS), Agriculture (USDA), Education and Justice will also be providing on-site information and services such as employment resources, healthcare consultation and legal counseling during the weekend of Father's Day. Other organizations including the Boys & Girls Club of America, Legal Services Corporation and the National Fatherhood Initiative (www.fatherhood.org/Page.aspx?pid=192) (NFI) are also partnering with housing authorities to make these events possible.
According to U.S. Census data, 24 million American children live in a home without a father. Also, NFI says children in homes absent a father are five times more likely to be poor; and are more likely to drop out of school or be incarcerated. Groups like NFI work to raise awareness about these realties and deliver the message, America needs dads.
HUD's national Father's Day 2016 campaign is in part modeled after the New York City Housing Authority 2010 Fatherhood Initiative, which hosted a day-long event in all five of its boroughs to kick off ongoing economic development, parenting workshops, tutoring and bonding activities for fathers and children. Watch the Father's Day 2016 video message (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bg8QeE6ZEM&feature=youtu.be).

06/21/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-094.cfm,HUD Awards $42 Million in Housing Counseling Grants,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today awarded more than $42 million in housing counseling grants to hundreds of national, regional and local organizations to help families and individuals with their housing needs and to prevent future foreclosures. HUD's housing counseling grants and the additional funding they leverage will assist more than 1.4 million households find housing, make more informed housing choices, or keep their current homes. See list of all counseling agencies awarded funding today.
June is National Homeownership Month, a time HUD recognizes how homeownership enhances lives and contributes to thriving communities. ""Dare to Own the Dream"" is the theme of this month-long recognition, reinforcing the long-held belief that owning a home remains one of the cornerstones of the American Dream. The grants awarded today were announced at a White House gathering to mark National Homeownership Month.
HUD Secretary Julián Castro said, ""Housing counselors provide potential homeowners with the tools they need to ensure they're ready and responsible. Their efforts give countless families a real shot at the American Dream of homeownership. The counseling organizations HUD supports are on the front lines in providing the full spectrum of services households need - from locating affordable rental housing, offering advice on how to become a homeowner, and preventing foreclosure.""
More than $40 million will directly support the housing counseling services provided by 31 national and regional organizations, five multi-state organizations, 17 State Housing Finance Agencies (SHFAs) and 181 local housing counseling agencies. In addition, HUD is awarding $2 million to four national organizations to train housing counselors who will receive the instruction and certification necessary to effectively assist families with their housing needs.
National and regional agencies distribute much of HUD's housing counseling grant funding to community-based organizations that assist low- and moderate-income families to improve their housing conditions. In addition, these larger organizations help improve the quality of housing counseling services and enhance coordination among counseling providers. Read a comprehensive summary of each grant.
Counseling improveshousing outcomes for homebuyers, homeowners, and renters. Last month, HUD published research findings summarizing the impact of housing counseling has on families' housing options and choices. Read more (https://www.hudexchange.info/resources/documents/Housing-Counseling-Works.pdf). In addition, recent research from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and the Urban Institute continues to find substantial benefits to housing counseling for families who purchase their first homes and those struggling to prevent foreclosure.
Grant recipients address the full range of families' housing counseling needs. This includes helping homebuyers evaluate their readiness for a home purchase, understand their financing and down payment options, and navigate what can be an extremely confusing and difficult homebuying process. The organization also help households find affordable rental housing and offer financial literacy training to individuals and families struggling to repair credit problems that restrict their housing options.
In addition to providing counseling to homeowners and renters, these organizations assist homeless persons in finding the transitional housing they need to move toward a permanent place to live. Finally, grantees also assist senior citizens seeking reverse mortgages. These agencies provide counseling for the rapidly growing number of elderly homeowners who seek to convert equity in their homes into income that can be used to pay for home improvements, medical costs, and other living expenses.
Housing counseling agencies support fair housing by assisting borrowers in reviewing their loan documentation, to avoid potential mortgage scams, unreasonably high interest rates, inflated appraisals, unaffordable repayment terms, and other conditions that can result in a loss of equity, increased debt, default, and even foreclosure. Likewise, foreclosure prevention counseling helps homeowners facing delinquency or default employ strategies, including expense reduction, negotiation with lenders and loan servicers, and loss mitigation, to avoid foreclosure.
There are many ways to find a HUD-approved housing counseling agency. Visit HUD's website or call (800) 569-4287 for our interactive telephone directory.

06/21/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-098.cfm,HUD Names New Moving To Work Advisory Committee,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today named 15 persons to a new federal research advisory committee charged with offering independent advice to HUD on how to approach specific aspects of the seven-year expansion of the Department's Moving to Work (MTW) Demonstration.
MTW is a demonstration program for public housing authorities that provides them the opportunity to design and test innovative, locally-designed strategies that increase housing choices for low-income families, use federal dollars more efficiently, and help residents find employment and become self-sufficient. MTW gives housing agencies exemptions from many existing requirements associated with their public housing and Housing Choice Voucher programs, as well as more flexibility with how they use their federal funds.
Last year, through the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, Congress directed HUD to expand MTW to include an additional 100 high-performing public housing authorities over the next seven years. In addition, Congress called upon HUD to establish a federal research advisory committee.
HUD appointed the committee members, which include staff and residents from existing MTW public housing authorities, professional independent researchers, and research and program experts from HUD. This new advisory committee will provide advice to HUD in the development of specific policy proposals and methods of research and evaluation. Members include:
HUD's anticipated timeline for the expansion is as follows:
Early Summer 2016: Publish a summary of submitted comments on www.hud.gov/mtw. Summer 2016: Begin the calls with the advisory committee, with an in-person meeting in Washington, DC in late-summer. Fall 2016: Publish the notice to select the initial cohort of MTW agencies, with up to four months to submit applications. Spring/Summer 2017: Select initial cohort of new MTW public housing authorities.

Estimated average relative standard errors of the preliminary data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2%) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90-percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. Changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show irregular movement. It takes 3 months to establish a trend for new houses sold. Preliminary new home sales figures are subject to revision due to the survey methodology and definitions used. The survey is primarily based on a sample of houses selected from building permits. Since a ""sale"" is defined as a deposit taken or sales agreement signed, this can occur prior to a permit being issued. An estimate of these prior sales is included in the sales figure. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimate of total sales is revised about 4 percent. Changes in sales price data reflect changes in the distribution of houses by region, size, etc., as well as changes in the prices of houses with identical characteristics.

06/23/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-101.cfm,HUD Finalizes Improved Tribal Consultation Policy; Offers Plan to Establish New Tribal Advisory Committee,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today an improved Tribal Government-to-Government Consultation Policy (https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-06-23/pdf/2016-14896.pdf) and is seeking public comment on a plan to establish a new Tribal Intergovernmental Advisory Committee (https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-06-23/pdf/2016-14895.pdf). Together, these two actions will strengthen the framework of HUD's relations with tribes.
The tribal consultation policy enhances communication and coordination between HUD and federally recognized Indian tribes, and outlines guiding principles and procedures under HUD's business relationship with American Indian and Alaska Native tribes. The policy was revised after regional consultations with tribes and a national comment period to discuss and inform the policy.
The purpose of the Tribal Intergovernmental Advisory Committee is to help facilitate intergovernmental communication between HUD and tribal leaders on all HUD programs, make recommendations to HUD regarding current program regulations that may require revision, advise in the development of HUD's American Indian and Alaska Native housing priorities, and encourage peer learning and capacity building among tribes and non-tribal entities. HUD is seeking tribal comment on the Tribal Intergovernmental Advisory Committee proposal and notice. There is a 30-day public comment period, ending July 23, 2016.
""We have been working with tribal leaders across the nation to improve affordable housing opportunities for families,"" said Lourdes Castro Ramírez, HUD Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for the Office of Public and Indian Housing. ""Today, we take an additional step to enhance our continuing partnership to support tribal self-determination and self-governance.""
HUD administers six programs that are specifically targeted to American Indian, Alaska Native, or Native Hawaiian individuals and families, and federally recognized tribal governments. This year alone, HUD is investing $718 million in hundreds of tribal communities to support place-based housing programs and a broad range of community development activities.
In 2009, President Obama reaffirmed the government-to-government relationship between the Federal Government and Indian tribal governments in a White House memorandum, and at that time directed all Executive departments and agencies to engage in regular and meaningful consultation and collaboration with tribal officials of federally recognized Indian tribes when developing federal policies that have tribal implications. In response, HUD began reassessing its tribal consultation policy, in effect since 2001.
In 2010, HUD held a series of regional discussions with tribes to discuss HUD's existing consultation policy and recommended changes to the policy. Each session was hosted by one of the six Office of Native American Programs (ONAP) Area Office Administrators. The collected comments from participants and those received by other means were carefully considered in the development of HUD's updated policy.

06/24/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-099.cfm,HUD & DOJ Award $8.7 Million to Prevent and End Homelessness,"WASHINGTON - For many individuals convicted of minor crimes, finding jobs and decent housing is so challenging that many are at extreme risk of homelessness or reentering the criminal justice system. Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) awarded $8.7 million to address homelessness and reduce recidivism among this justice-involved population through the Pay for Success model.& See list of grantees below.
HUD's Pay for Success Permanent Supportive Housing Demonstration (https://www.cfda.gov/?s=program&mode=form&tab=step1&id=423da6449df694848220c74ef341429b), tests cost-effective ways to help persons cycling between the criminal justice and homeless service systems. Funded by DOJ and implemented through a HUD/DOJ partnership, this demonstration advances a model that offers a new source of financing to expand permanent supportive housing for the reentry population. This is part of a broader Administration effort to reduce barriers facing justice-involved individuals who are trying to put their lives back on track, including barriers to housing. Read a White House fact sheet on these efforts (https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/06/24/fact-sheet-president-obama-announces-new-actions-reduce-recidivism-and).
""Too often, as people leave the criminal justice system, they don't have the support network to help them get a second chance and they fall into homelessness,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""These grantees have developed successful models that give returning citizens the opportunity to find a job and place to call home while reducing the costs associated with recidivism and homelessness.""
""Every person re-entering society from the justice system deserves a fair shot at a life of renewed purpose and meaning,"" said Attorney General Loretta Lynch. ""The Justice Department's partnership with HUD will expand services to help individuals gain access to housing and jobs, and to give those who have served their time a chance to fully rejoin society. Going forward, we intend to continue to promote and develop programs that help our returning citizens stay safe, supported, and secure.""
Secretary Castro made the announcement today at an interagency event led by DOJ at the Center for American Progress.
Research consistently demonstrates a correlation between homelessness and incarceration. The National Alliance to End Homelessness (NAEH) estimates that one in five people living prison becomes homeless upon reentry into the community, with an increase of 30-50 percent in major urban areas. Tracking the cycle of homelessness and incarceration in the reverse, the Council of States Governments and NAEH report that over 10 percent of people recidivating from jail and prison are homeless in the months before their incarceration. This rate jumps to 20 percent among individuals with a mental illness.
Pay for Success (PFS) strategies are public-private arrangements that help government test or expand innovative programs while paying only for those activities that achieve agreed-upon target outcomes. These grants will support PFS projects that implement a Housing First model for the reentry population who experience homelessness and are frequent users of homelessness, health care and other crisis services.
Established by President Obama, the Federal Interagency Reentry Council includes 20 federal agencies, that work to:
make communities safer by reducing recidivism and victimization; assist those who return from prison and jail in becoming productive citizens; and save taxpayer dollars by lowering the direct and collateral costs of incarceration.
• make communities safer by reducing recidivism and victimization;
• assist those who return from prison and jail in becoming productive citizens; and
• save taxpayer dollars by lowering the direct and collateral costs of incarceration.
The Reentry Council, recently codified by Presidential Memorandum, is removing federal barriers to successful reentry, so that motivated individuals - who have served their time and paid their dues - are able to compete for a job, attain stable housing, support their children and their families, and contribute to their communities. Reentry Council agencies are taking concrete steps to reduce recidivism and high correctional costs while improving public health, child welfare, employment, education, housing and other key reintegration outcomes.
In 2010, President Obama and 19 federal agencies and offices that form the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH) launched the nation's first comprehensive strategy to prevent and end homelessness. Opening Doors: Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness (http://www.usich.gov/opening_doors/) serves as a roadmap for how the federal government will work with state and local communities to confront the root causes of homelessness, including individuals who are in and out of a variety of crisis services such as jails and prisons. Permanent supportive housing lowers public costs by stopping the revolving door between jail and prison and crisis services like those provided in emergency rooms and homeless assistance programs.

""No child should be limited in life by the zip code where they were born,"" said Castro. ""Today, we're kick starting the revitalization in 10 distressed neighborhoods across the country. These grants will lay a firm foundation upon which we'll build better, more thoughtful neighborhoods that are more connected to all the opportunities their communities have to offer.""
Choice Neighborhoods is HUD's signature place-based initiative and its vision builds on the work that has been done by the Neighborhood Revitalization Initiative, an interagency partnership between HUD, the Department of Education, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice, and Treasury, since 2009. Choice Neighborhoods is focused on three core goals:
Housing: Replace distressed public and assisted housing with high-quality mixed-income housing that is well-managed and responsive to the needs of the surrounding neighborhood. People: Improve educational outcomes and intergenerational mobility for youth with services and supports delivered directly to youth and their families. Neighborhood: Create the conditions necessary for public and private reinvestment in distressed neighborhoods to offer the kinds of amenities and assets, including safety, good schools, and commercial activity, that are important to families' choices about their community.
• Housing: Replace distressed public and assisted housing with high-quality mixed-income housing that is well-managed and responsive to the needs of the surrounding neighborhood.

• Neighborhood: Create the conditions necessary for public and private reinvestment in distressed neighborhoods to offer the kinds of amenities and assets, including safety, good schools, and commercial activity, that are important to families' choices about their community.
Until now, Choice Neighborhoods Planning Grant funds could only be used to create a neighborhood Transformation Plan. However, experience with the 63 previously awarded Choice Neighborhoods Planning Grantees has shown that tangible, early actions help sustain community energy, attract new resources, and build momentum to turn that plan into reality.
HUD's FY15/16 Choice Neighborhoods Planning Grant funds build upon these lessons by introducing Planning and Action Grants. Greater Dayton Premier Management, Louisville Metro Housing Authority, the City of Phoenix, and the City of Shreveport will each receive additional funding for action activities. With this additional funding, communities with severely distressed public or HUD-assisted housing will continue to develop a successful neighborhood transformation plan and build the support necessary for that plan to be successfully implemented. In addition, Planning and Action Grant funds will also enable activities including:
Reclaiming and recycling vacant property into community gardens, pocket parks, farmers' markets, or land banking; Beautification, place making, and community arts projects; Homeowner and business façade improvement programs; Neighborhood broadband/Wi-Fi; Fresh food initiatives; and Gap financing for economic development projects.

Through the Choice Neighborhoods planning process local governments, housing authorities, residents, nonprofits, tribal authorities, private developers, school districts, police departments, and other civic organizations create a common vision and develop effective strategies to revitalize their neighborhood. The resulting Transformation Plan and locally driven Action Activities lay the foundation for revitalizing the distressed public and/or assisted housing units, transforming the surrounding neighborhood, and promoting opportunities for families."
06/29/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-102.cfm,"Nearly 6,000 Households in 28 Metro Areas Participating in Rigorous HUD Study on Homebuyer Education and Counseling","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today published early findings from a rigorous, large-scale, random assignment study on the benefits that housing education and counseling provides to first-time homebuyers. Early results from The First-Time Homebuyer Education and Counseling Demonstration (https://www.huduser.gov/portal/publications/first-homebuyer-early-insights.html) are encouraging and suggest homebuyer education and counseling may lead to favorable results for first-time homebuyers in terms of mortgage literacy and preparedness, homebuyer outcomes, and loan performance.
This critical study will help confirm whether first-time homebuyer education and counseling can expand access to credit and help borrowers make better choices to achieve housing and financial stability. Although there have been numerous recent studies (https://www.hudexchange.info/resources/documents/Housing-Counseling-Works.pdf) documenting the effectiveness of housing counseling, this study is groundbreaking in its scale, experimental design, elimination of any selection bias, and expected length that the families will be followed.
Between September 2013 and January 2016, HUD enrolled a diverse sample of more than 5,800 prospective first-time homebuyers across 28 metro areas. The study involves three large national lenders, 63 HUD-approved housing counseling agencies, and two remote service providers. Each family was randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: remote (online education and telephone-based counseling), in-person (group workshops and individual counseling) and a control group that was not offered any services. HUD found that 65 percent of early participants who were offered remote homebuyer education and counseling initiated services versus just 25 percent of those who were offered in-person education and counseling.
""The early findings of this study underscore the need to continue supporting housing education and counseling programs, and the particular importance of making remote education and telephone counseling easily accessible to prospective homebuyers"" said Katherine O'Regan, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research. ""Over the next four years, we expect to produce long-sought answers about the impact of homebuyer education and counseling on mortgage literacy and preparedness, homebuyer outcomes and loan performance.""
The preliminary impacts of the study on the ""early enrollee"" sample of 2,377 participants include:
Improved mortgage literacy.Participants in a treatment group performed better a four-question mortgage literacy quiz than their control group counterparts. Greater appreciation for communication with lenders.Treatment group members are more likely to report that they would contact their lender before missing a mortgage payment. This finding indicates that education and counseling are successfully encouraging participants to engage productively with their lenders in times of distress. Improved underwriting qualifications.Treatment group members are more likely than their control group counterparts to have a credit score of 620 or higher. This finding shows that education and counseling are helping treatment group members correct inaccuracies in their credit reports, reduce bad credit events such as late or missed payment, or both to push their credit scores over the 620 threshold. No evidence of improved budgeting practices.Treatment group members are no more or less likely than their control group counterparts to compare a budget with their actual spending.

The study's early findings suggest that homebuyer education and counseling could be a cornerstone of successfully expanding homeownership opportunity and decreasing mortgage delinquency and foreclosures.
On June 22nd, the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies issued its annual State of the Nation's Housing report showing a continued decade-long downward trend in homeownership rates, while also noting that the vast majority of Americans indicate a preference for homeownership and that homeownership remains a key component of wealth building potential. Understanding the extent that education and counseling can facilitate homebuyer success at gaining and keeping a mortgage is critical to mapping the future homeownership strategy for America."
06/30/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-105.cfm,FHA Announces Most Significant Improvements to Date for Distressed Notes Sales Program,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is making a series of enhancements to the Department's Distressed Asset Stabilization Program (DASP) that would have purchasers of severely delinquent mortgages offer qualified borrowers principal reductions and protection from ""payment shock."" Certain families with distressed mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) may soon be eligible for a reduction of their outstanding loan amounts should their mortgages be sold through DASP.
In addition, FHA's latest enhancements prohibit investors from abandoning low-value properties in high-foreclosure neighborhoods to prevent blight. FHA is also offering greater opportunity for non-profit organizations, local governments and other governmental entities to participate in DASP. Loans are not eligible to be sold through DASP unless and until all FHA loss mitigation efforts are exhausted. On average, mortgages sold through this sales program are 29 months delinquent at the time of the auction. Read additional details on the latest enhancements announced today.
""FHA is deeply committed to protecting struggling homeowners and making certain they have the greatest opportunities to avoid foreclosure and remain in their homes,"" said Ed Golding, HUD's Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for the Office of Housing. ""While thousands of homeowners avoided foreclosure through this note sales program, we continue to explore new ways to help these families and to offer more opportunities for public-minded organizations to have a seat at the table.""
FHA's new DASP enhancements include:
Principal Reduction/Capital Arrearage Forgiveness - Principal forgiveness is the first option investors must consider offering to borrowers when evaluating them for a modification. Payment Shock Protection - FHA will limit interest rate increases to no more than one percent per year after a five-year period where the rate is fixed; this is consistent with the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP). Walk-Away Prohibition - Effective immediately, FHA will prohibit any purchaser of single-family mortgages under DASP from abandoning lower value properties in order to prevent neighborhood blight. Alternative Bidding for Non-Profit Buyers - This enhancement will allow qualified non-profit organizations to bid on a partial pool of notes up to five percent of a National Pool and to pay the reserve price. This alternative offers another opportunity for non-profit organizations and local governments to participate in DASP along with those announced last year (non-profit/government-only NSO pools and direct sales offerings). Streamline Direct Sales to Interested Government Entities - FHA is providing new standard guidance on the sale of distressed mortgages directly to qualified government entities and local governments. This will provide greater education and awareness among these public entities which may be interested in participating in DASP. Target loans for DASP sales based on the interest of non-profits and local governments-FHA will enhance its efforts to identify and offer loans in targeted distressed areas to non-profits and local governments. FHA will continue its outreach to solicit their interest in geographically targeted loan sales. These efforts are aimed at helping vulnerable neighborhoods maintain more stable communities.

Last year, FHA strengthened DASP to further help defaulting families still living in their homes and to allow for greater participation among non-profit organizations. FHA expanded a foreclosure moratorium from six-to-12 months, requiring purchasers of these distressed mortgages to suspend any foreclosure action against these families. In direct response to non-profit organizations seeking to participate in DASP auctions, FHA provided more advanced notice of pending sales and extended the due diligence periods to accommodate these organizations. In addition, FHA offered a 'first look' opportunity for non-profits to purchase vacant properties to be occupied by owner-occupants. Finally, FHA created specific pools of mortgages that would be exclusively offered to non-profit organizations and local governments."
07/01/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-106.cfm,HUD Awards $5 Million to Reward Local Housing Authorities Working to End Veteran Homelessness,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today awarded more than $5 million to 42 local public housing authorities across the country that are working aggressively to end veteran homelessness. HUD is awarding additional funds to help these housing authorities administer a joint program with HUD and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) which provides permanent homes and needed services to veterans experiencing long-term, chronic homelessness (see local funding below).
The HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) Program works to reduce veteran homelessness because it provides funding for both the housing and supportive services that are essential for ending homelessness for tens of thousands of veterans nationwide. The additional funds awarded today will help these PHAs continue their extraordinary efforts to house veterans in an expedited manner.
""These housing authorities are going above and beyond in the movement to end veteran homelessness,"" said Lourdes Castro-Ramirez, HUD's Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing. ""Today we reward those who are out there doing the heavy lifting to find real and lasting housing solutions for veterans who might otherwise be living on our streets.""
The local PHAs receiving these extraordinary fees are undertaking aggressive efforts to house veterans in an expedited manner. The agencies are also launching robust marketing campaign and hosting Landlord Fairs to recruit landlords/property owners to participate in the program. In addition these agencies are hiring temporary staff to provide additional housing search assistance, expedite processing of documentation, inspect units, issue vouchers, and execute leases."
07/05/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-104.cfm,HUD Awards $24 Million to Renew Support to 25 Local HIV-AIDS Housing Programs,"WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced $24 million in grants to assist more than 1,200 low-income persons living with HIV/AIDS and their families annually. These grants provide a combination of housing assistance and supportive services for this vulnerable population.
The funding announced today is offered through HUD's Housing Opportunities for Persons With AIDS Program (HOPWA) (https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/hopwa/) and will renew HUD's support of 25 local programs. These local programs will use the grants announced today to continue providing housing assistance to more than 1,200 households annually throughout the three-year grant period.
""Simply put, housing is healthcare,"" said Secretary Julián Castro. ""We're proud to continue working with our local partners to provide housing and care for low-income individuals living with HIV/AIDS and their families. Their hard work continues to provide opportunities for our fellow Americans to build productive and prosperous futures.""
HUD is providing renewal grants to the following local programs:
Read a comprehensive summary for each grantee.
Research shows that a stable home is critical to the health of persons with HIV/AIDS, and results in better health and reduced transmission of the disease. In addition to housing assistance, these local programs will provide access to supportive services such as case management, mental health services, substance abuse services, and employment training. The combination of housing assistance and supportive services are critical in sustaining housing stability, promoting better health outcomes, and increasing quality of life, which promotes self-sufficiency efforts for those able to transition to the private housing market.
Since 1992, HUD's HOPWA Program, managed by the Office of HIV/AIDS Housing, has provided national leadership and resources that support the development and operation of high-quality supportive housing programs. Under the HOPWA Program, HUD makes grants to cities, states, and nonprofit organizations to provide housing assistance and supportive services to low-income persons living with HIV/AIDS and their families. By providing assistance with housing and related services, the HOPWA program helps persons living with HIV/AIDS enter into housing, access and remain in medical care, and adhere to complex treatment regimens. More information on the HOPWA program is available at https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/hopwa/."
07/14/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-107.cfm,2016 HUD Secretary Design Award Winners Announced,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the American Institute of Architects (AIA) today announced four model housing developments in California, Illinois, Texas and Washington State are the recipients of the 2016 HUD Secretary's Housing and Community Design Award (https://www.huduser.gov/portal/about/housingCommDesign-2016-1.html). Each of these developments are recognized for excellence in affordable or accessible housing design.
""Each of these developments are innovative housing opportunities offering seniors and families alike a place to thrive,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""These winners prove that affordable and accessible housing can become part of the fabric of any neighborhood and reinforce the principles of inclusiveness and opportunity.""
The new HUD Secretary's Housing and Community Design Award recipients are:
Excellence in Affordable Housing Design Award - This award recognizes architecture that demonstrates overall excellence in terms of design in response to both the needs and constraints of affordable housing.
Located in a prime neighborhood on the banks of Oakland's Lake Merritt, this building is now home to 91 very-low-income and special-needs homeless seniors, many of whom have been displaced with the Bay Area's rapidly rising housing costs. The building has extensive on-site services and is designed to support independent living, with strong transit connections to downtown Oakland and San Francisco and access to amenities, including a pharmacy and grocery. The high-density housing—138 units per acre—provides indoor and outdoor community spaces at both the ground floor and upper levels. The central west-facing main courtyard opens visually toward the street and is warmed by afternoon sun. A rooftop suite of community spaces overlooks the lake, maximizing views for the most users. Designed with a complementary series of sustainable strategies, the building is pending receipt of LEED for Homes Mid-Rise Platinum Certification.
The ground-floor community room includes a kitchen and TV lounge as well as space for activities—from art programs to monthly resident town hall meetings. This community space opens widely to the courtyard, creating a flexible indoor-outdoor plaza. The private space offers views to the neighborhood and is visible to passersby, balancing security and transparency and connecting the building to the life of the larger neighborhood. The two building masses connect across the courtyard at the upper levels via sunny bridges with neighborhood and lake views. A fifth-floor suite of community spaces includes rooftop garden plots for residents, a community room and kitchen, outdoor decks, and a wellness studio—used for stretching and tai chi sessions. This suite overlooks the lake, maximizing views for the greatest number of users. The in-progress art program is a partnership with a local nonprofit gallery that supports developmentally disabled artists. Artworks are licensed and reproduced at a large scale, creating pieces that are appropriate to the large common areas on an accessible budget.

Creating Community Connection Award - This award recognizes projects that incorporate housing within other community amenities for the purpose of either revitalization or planned growth.
Dorchester Art + Housing Collaborative (DA+HC), a 32-unit mixed housing development and vibrant arts and cultural hub for Chicago's Greater Grand Crossing neighborhood, has transformed Dante Harper townhouses which werebuilt by the Chicago Housing Authorityin the early 1980's and vacated in 2007. The project embodies a successful collaboration between private, public, and non-profit sectors committed to transforming the Greater Grand Crossing neighborhood through the reactivation of abandoned buildings and cultural foundations. DA+HC comprises 32 of the original 36 two- and three-bedroom townhouse units; the four center units were removed to create a 2,200 square foot Arts Center complete with a dance studio, work and tech shops, and public meeting space. The Arts Center and adjacent landscaped courtyard function as a community hub and support a variety of programs, including a life-planning class, a neighborhood ensemble band, and a weekly gathering of residents to brainstorm strategies for improving the area. The DA+HC supports programs from outside organizations and institutions, such as the South Shore Fine Arts Academy and the Joffrey Ballet. In addition, the DA+HC is within close proximity to other cultural sites, such as Black Cinema House and Stony Island Arts Bank. With an even distribution of low-income, affordable, and market rate units, 72% of the occupants are at or below 80 percent of area median income. To foster dialogue and collaboration between artists and community members, DA+HC is the first in the nation to provide artist residences in public housing. The artists living onsite volunteer their time to develop programming and catalyze neighborhood revitalization through artistic practice, individual empowerment, and community engagement. Four units were gutted and converted into flat configurations to achieve accessibility compliance. Renovation was designed to Energy Star standards with energy-efficient windows, doors, lighting, and appliances, a super-insulted building shell, and air quality and resource conservation. Stormwater is stored onsite by way of green roofs, rain gardens, and permeable pavers. When possible, materials were reused from the original building and incorporated into railings and cabinetry. With an 18% unemployment rate, 25% of the population below the poverty line, and ranked 5th among violent crimes in Chicago neighborhoods, the project is intended to stimulate a community revitalization that is culturally-based, artist-led, and neighborhood-driven. Financing included Low Income Housing Tax Credits, state Donation Tax Credits, a Chicago Housing Authority loan, and a grant from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago.

Community-Informed Design - This award recognizes design that supports physical communities as they rebuild inner city social structures and relationships that may have been weakened by outmigration, disinvestment, and the isolation of inner city areas.
Disaster Recovery Round 2 (DR2) in Houston was launched five years after Hurricane Ike devastated the Texas Gulf Coast to fill the gap in home repair and replacement and offer homeowners choice in their disaster recovery experience. It brought together design expertise of local design architects and insight from residents directly affected by the storm to build single family high quality cost-effective sustainable houses that respect community interests and character. Six target neighborhoods (called Community Revitalization Areas or Outreach Areas) in the City of Houston were engaged through several public events which offered opportunities for a diverse group of residents, community leaders, city staff and local designers to provide direct input. The design team gathered information about each neighborhood from demographic research and documentation of neighborhood form and character. Following initial research, engagement events included a workshop, a focus group, and gallery shows that collected input from more than 300 neighborhood residents.

Each of the engagements generated a report of resident commentary, activity results, and analysis that provided guidelines for local design architects to refine their home designs. To address the housing needs on a multi-neighborhood scale, the vetted home designs were compiled into a catalogue to provide options for family-based design development and construction. Home designs were then approved and permitted by the City, and individual homeowners were scheduled to meet with design team representatives. Homeowners were provided a selection of catalogue designs based on neighborhood preferences and site considerations. They were then walked through each of the design options to help them select a house that met their needs and preferences. To date, over 260 homeowners have met with the design team to select a home from the catalogue. The approach to DR2 created a collaborative relationship with the city, residents, and local designers. This ensured the process supported local professionals as well as benefited residents, and home designs were appropriate to the communities in which they were placed and have the versatility to meet the needs of their residents.

For Housing Accessibility - Alan J. Rothman Award - The purpose of this award is to recognize exemplary projects that demonstrate excellence in improving housing accessibility for people with disabilities.
Port Townsend Residence in Port Townsend, Washington is a modest home on a small level lot in a small community arranged around a common garden space which was built to accommodate a couple, one of whom uses a power wheelchair. The house offers an accessible route from the street through the house to the terrace and on to the common garden space, thus expanding the effective living space and to facilitating daily strolls in the neighborhood. For longer trips, the husband uses an accessible van. The attached carport accommodates the van with its ramp, creating a covered accessible route from the front entrance into the van.
An open plan facilitates circulation of a power wheel chair within a modest footprint. The telescoping doors to the bedrooms allow the owners choice in how to use the rooms and how connected they are to the living spaces. To facilitate use with limited dexterity, pocket doors have large panel-mounted handles which do not disappear entirely into the wall. The house is constructed with a Douglas fir timber frame enclosing Structural Insulated Panels (SIPs). SIPs offer continuous insulation and fewer pathways for air infiltration than standard stick frame construction, resulting in a tight, energy efficient assembly. Tall windows on the south side of the house gather passive solar energy. The entry door and sidelight feature vertical glazing to allow viewing of the external approach from any height. The kitchen can be used from both a standing position and from a wheelchair. Knee space is provided beneath the sink. A pot filler faucet on the cooktop reduces the need to carry heavy pots. A wall oven and a wall-mounted microwave oven keep the oven racks within the proper reach range. Base cabinets fitted with drawers and a floor-to-ceiling cupboard maximizes shelving within the reach range of a wheelchair user. The bathrooms have knee space beneath the vanity. A Universal height toilet serves both users. The threshold-free shower uses a linear drain. Towel bars and the adjustable shower head bar are built and anchored as grab bars, so that any of them can be relied upon in a fall. Two sets of shower valves and heads in each shower allow use by both owners without readjustment. Wire baskets, rather than recesses, are provided to restrain shampoo bottles and soap from falling until they can be securely grasped."

Now, public housing and HUD-assisted residents living in Comcast's service area are eligible to apply for Internet Essentials (www.internetessentials.com), the company's high-speed internet adoption program for low-income families. Including homes covered by Comcast's pilot public housing expansion announced in March, an estimated total of up to 2 million HUD-assisted homes, including Public Housing, Housing Choice Voucher, and Multifamily programs, will now have access to low-cost internet service.
""ConnectHome is opening doors of opportunity for our next generation of Americans,"" said HUD Secretary, Julián Castro. ""Today's announcement has the potential to transform the lives of hundreds of thousands of kids across the nation by giving them the tools to reach their full potential. We're grateful to Comcast for joining the ConnectHome initiative, which has extended its reach to more than 1.5 million children in one short year.""
""This announcement reaffirms Comcast's determination to make a meaningful impact to close the digital divide for low-income families in this country,"" said David L. Cohen, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Diversity Officer of Comcast. ""This is the single largest expansion of the Internet Essentials program in its history, and we're thrilled to be working with HUD to help connect even more families, including seniors, veterans, and adults without children, to the transformative power of having internet service at home.""

*These numbers are for all HUD-assisted homes of which approximately 35 percent have school-aged children and are, therefore, already eligible to apply for Internet Essentials. These numbers also include households covered by Comcast's public housing pilot announced in March.
Between 2009 and 2014, broadband service providers spent over $422 billion on capital investments, and three in four American households now use broadband at home. Despite this significant progress, one in four American households still don't access the internet at home, particularly lower-income families with children. According to the 2013 American Community Survey, less than 43 percent of individuals without a high school diploma or equivalent lack home internet access, but under this opportunity adults and young learners can get connected from the comfort of their own homes and take advantage of resources to get a GED, apply for and complete college, and acquire the necessary digital literacy skills to thrive in a highly competitive, global workforce.
ConnectHome strives to ensure students can access the same level of high-speed Internet at home that they have in their classrooms. Today's announcement furthers this vision, benefiting students of all ages.
This is the ninth time in five years Comcast has expanded eligibility for Internet Essentials. The policy change marks the first time, nationally, households without children eligible to participate in the National School Lunch Program are officially able to apply for Internet Essentials. In 2011, the program was first offered to families with children eligible to receive a free school lunch from the National School Lunch Program. It was expanded, in 2012, to children eligible for the reduced price school lunch program. In 2013, Comcast expanded eligibility to include families with children in parochial, private, charter, and cyber schools, as well as students who are home schooled. Last year, Comcast extended the program two more times, on a pilot basis, to low-income seniors and low-income community college students. Earlier this year, another pilot program extended Internet Essentials to those living in public housing in Miami, Nashville, Philadelphia, and Seattle. Finally, Comcast has expanded the number of schools where every student in the school will be deemed eligible for the program so long as a certain percentage of the kids in that school are NSLP eligible – from 70 percent, to 50 percent, and now to 40 percent. As a result, Comcast estimates auto-enrollment now applies to about half of the 48,000 schools across its service area.
Internet Essentials Key Investments
From August 2011 through December 2015, Internet Essentials has connected more than 600,000 low-income families, benefitting more than 2.4 million Americans, to the internet at home. Also since 2011, Comcast has invested more than $280 million in cash and in-kind support to help fund digital literacy training and education initiatives,reaching nearly 4.4 million people through national and local nonprofit community partners.
Provided more than 47,000 subsidized computers at less than $150 each. Distributed for free nearly 51 million Internet Essentials program materials.

07/18/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-109.cfm,HUD Awards $75 Million to Help Low-Income Residents Receive Job Training and Employment,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today awarded $75 million to help families living in public housing and those participating in HUD's Housing Choice Voucher Program connect with services to further their education, find good jobs, and to set them on a path to self-sufficiency. Read more about the local impact of the grants announced today.
Funded through HUD's Family Self-Sufficiency Program (FSS), these grants allow public housing agencies (PHAs) to work with social service agencies, community colleges, businesses, and other local partners to help public housing residents and individuals participating in HUD's Housing Choice Voucher Program advance their education or gain marketable skills that will help them get a job or advance in their current workplace. As of Fiscal Year 2015, recipients of Project-Based Rental Assistance are also eligible to participate in the program.
""Connecting folks to jobs is an important part of HUD's mission as the Department of Opportunity,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""By linking people to computer access, job training, childcare, and ultimately financial empowerment, these grants help people who are ready to compete and succeed in the workplace. HUD is proud to give them these tools for self-sufficiency.""
HUD's FSS Program helps local public housing authorities hire service coordinators who work directly with residents to connect them with programs and services that already exist in the local community. These Service Coordinators build relationships with the network of local service providers so as to more effectively serve the residents. The program encourages innovative strategies that link public housing and Housing Choice Voucher assistance with other resources. This broad spectrum of services will enable participating families to find jobs, increase earned income, reduce or eliminate the need for rental and/or welfare assistance, and make progress toward achieving economic independence and housing self-sufficiency.
Participants in the program sign a five-year contract that requires the head of the household to obtain employment and that no member of the FSS family is receiving cash welfare assistance at the end of the five-year term. Families in the FSS program have an interest-bearing escrow account established for them. The amount credited to the family's escrow account is based on increases in the family's earned income during the term of the FSS contract. If the family successfully completes its FSS contract, the family receives the escrow funds that it can use for any purpose, including improving credit scores, paying educational expenses, or a down-payment on a home.
The Family Self Sufficiency (FSS) Program is a long-standing resource for increasing economic security and self-sufficiency among participants. HUD's Office of Policy Development and Research issued Evaluation of FSS Program: Prospective Study (www.huduser.gov/portal/publications/affhsg/eval_fssp.html) in 2011 that evaluated the effectiveness of the FSS Program. Conducted from 2005 to 2009, the study showed that financial benefits are substantial for participants who remain in and complete the program. An earlier study (www.huduser.gov/portal/publications/econdev/selfsufficiency.html) found that individuals who participated in the FSS program fared better financially than those who did not enroll in the program. HUD is currently conducting a longitudinal study on the program, with the first set of results expected in 2018."
07/19/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-110.cfm,FHA to Insure Mortgages on Certain Properties with Pace Assessments,"WASHINGTON - In order to enable homeowners seeking clean energy technologies in their homes to leverage a range of financing options, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) today announced guidance that makes clear the circumstances under which it will insure mortgages on properties that include Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) assessments. FHA will now approve purchase and refinance mortgage applications in states that treat PACE obligations as special assessments similar to property taxes. Read more about FHA's new guidance.
FHA's action is part of a larger Administration effort to expand access to clean energy technologies to every American family with the option to transition to solar energy and make improvements to their homes to cut their energy bills. Read more (https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/07/19/fact-sheet-obama-administration-announces-clean-energy-savings-all).
PACE is showing promise as an effective way to finance energy efficiency, renewable energy, water conservation, and other resilience upgrades to homes, including new heating and cooling systems, lighting improvements, solar panels, water pumps, and insulation. PACE pays the costs for such enhancements and is repaid through an assessment added to the property's tax bill. State and local governments sponsor PACE financing to encourage energy efficiency, solar energy deployment, advance resilience, create jobs, promote economic development, and protect the environment.
""Today, we're seizing the opportunity to shape a cleaner and more sustainable nation,"" said Ed Golding, HUD Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Housing. ""Using PACE, families will be able to make their homes more energy efficient and sustainable in the long run, while still keeping their costs affordable today. As PACE programs continue to develop across the nation, the positive impact on families, jobs, and the environment will only grow.""
FHA's new guidance addresses PACE programs where the PACE obligation is treated like a property tax and does not allow the full obligation to have priority or 'prime' status over the FHA mortgage lien. By law, FHA cannot accept a first lien PACE structure (except for past due amounts as is the case for all tax assessments). In accordance with existing guidance, lenders will be responsible for escrowing PACE payments as they would property taxes. In addition, purchasers of homes with existing PACE obligations will be responsible for any unpaid balance of the obligation.
The guidance protects FHA from risk in a variety of ways. Lenders must escrow payments for PACE assessment so FHA should never be at risk of losing collateral in a tax sale. FHA is also protected as its appraisal policy requires that appraisals take into account the PACE assessment and the value of the improvements.
The Department of Energy is updating its Best Practices Guidelines for Residential PACE Financing, which may be used by states and counties to align with their consumer protection goals.
To qualify for FHA insurance on mortgages for properties that include PACE assessments, lenders must determine that the following requirements have been met under the laws in the state where the property is located:
The PACE obligation must be collected (escrowed) and secured by the creditor in the same manner as a special assessment against the property. The PACE obligation cannot accelerate - namely, the entire amount of the obligation cannot become due in the event of delinquency after endorsement of the FHA-insured mortgage. The property may be subject to an enforceable claim or lien that is superior to the FHA-insured mortgage but only for the delinquent portion of the PACE obligation. There are no terms or conditions that limit the transfer of the property to a new homeowner. The existence of a PACE obligation on a property is readily apparent to mortgagees, appraisers, borrowers and other parties to an FHA-insured mortgage transaction, and information on PACE obligations must be readily available for review in the public records where the property is located. In the event of the sale, including a foreclosure sale, of the property with outstanding PACE financing, the PACE assessment remains with the property. In cases of foreclosure, priority collection of delinquent payments for the PACE assessment may be waived or relinquished. Unless a payoff is negotiated, the buyer will assume the obligation and will be responsible for the payments on the outstanding PACE amount.

EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take two months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, 4 months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2%) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90-percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised about three percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found on our web site listed above.
* 90% confidence interval includes zero. The Census Bureau does not have sufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero.

07/20/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-112.cfm,HUD Awards More Than $52 Million to Protect Children and Families from Dangerous Lead and Other Home Hazards,"WASHINGTON - To protect children and families from the hazards of lead-based paint and from other home health and safety hazards, The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today awarded more than $52.6 million in Lead Based Paint Hazard Control grants to 23 local and state government agencies (see chart below). Read a complete project-by-project summary of the programs awarded grants today.
The grant funding announced today will reduce the number of children with elevated blood lead levels, and protect families by targeting health hazards in over 2,800 low-income homes with significant lead and other home health and safety hazards. The Lead Based Paint Hazard Control grant program has a demonstrated history of success, filling critical needs in urban communities where no other resources exist to address substandard housing that threatens the health of the most vulnerable residents.
HUD Secretary Julián Castro made the announcement during an event hosted by the Center for American Progress called: Creating Safe and Healthy Homes for All. HUD is focused on advancing policies that create opportunities for all Americans, including helping children and families secure quality housing by protecting them from the hazards of lead-based paint and other home health and safety hazards.
""Lead hazards have plagued our nation's children for decades, causing irreversible physical, emotional and mental side effects, and limiting the futures of so many among our next generation,"" said Secretary Castro. Our lead hazard control grant program is one of the strongest tools HUD has at its disposal to fight lead poisoning. With this funding, communities can remove lead hazards from low-income homes and give families a safer, brighter future.""
""Millions of families and children are seeing their hope for the future threatened by poor healthsimply because of where they live,"" noted Michelle M. Miller, Acting Director of HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes. ""This round of funding includes awards to five cities and states that are receiving grant awards for the first time. We are pleased the program is expanding into these previously unserved communities.""
Unsafe and unhealthy homes affect the health of millions of people of all income levels, geographic areas, and walks of life in the U.S. These homes affect the economy directly, through increased utilization of health care services, and indirectly through lost wages and increased school days missed. Housing improvements help prevent injuries and illnesses, reduce associated health care and social services costs, reduce absentee rates for children in school and adults at work, and reduce stress, all which help to improve the quality of life.
Recently, HUD announced The Lead-Safe Homes, Lead-Free Kids Toolkit to strengthen protections for families living in HUD-assisted housing and prevent the devastating life-long effects of lead poisoning. The toolkit provides both immediate actions and a long-term vision to address lead in homes both through immediate changes to HUD programs and legislative proposals that would give HUD needed authority to ensure all HUD housing is lead-safe.
HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes promotes local efforts to eliminate dangerous lead paint and other housing-related health hazards from lower income homes; stimulate private sector investment in lead hazard control; supports cutting-edge research on methods for assessing and controlling housing-related health and safety hazards; and educates the public about the dangers of hazards in the home.
The funding announced today directs critical funds to cities, counties and states to eliminate dangerous lead paint and other housing-related health hazards in thousands of privately-owned, low-income housing units. As part of these awards, HUD is providing these Lead Based Paint Hazard Control grantees over $6.6 million in Healthy Homes supplemental funding to help communities mitigate multiple health hazards in high risk housing simultaneously,in conjunction with their lead hazard control activities."
07/26/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-115.cfm,HUD and Census Bureau Report New Residential Sales in June,"WASHINGTON - Sales of new single-family houses in June 2016 were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 592,000, according to estimates released jointly today by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Census Bureau. This is 3.5 percent (±23.9%)* above the revised May rate of 572,000 and is 25.4 percent (±27.9%)* above the June 2015 estimate of 472,000.
The median sales price of new houses sold in June 2016 was $306,700; the average sales price was $358,200. The seasonally adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of June was 244,000. This represents a supply of 4.9 months at the current sales rate.
Estimates of houses sold and for sale by stage of construction are now available on a seasonally adjusted basis as well as not seasonally adjusted basis. Historic seasonally adjusted data will be available back to January 1999 at http://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/historical_data/.
New Residential Sales data for July 2016 will be released on Tuesday, August 23, 2016, at 10:00 A.M. EST. Read more about new residential sales activity (www.census.gov/construction/nrs/index.html).

It takes 3 months to establish a trend for new houses sold. Preliminary new home sales figures are subject to revision due to the survey methodology and definitions used. The survey is primarily based on a sample of houses selected from building permits. Since a ""sale"" is defined as a deposit taken or sales agreement signed, this can occur prior to a permit being issued. An estimate of these prior sales is included in the sales figure. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimate of total sales is revised about 4 percent. Changes in sales price data reflect changes in the distribution of houses by region, size, etc., as well as changes in the prices of houses with identical characteristics.

07/26/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-114.cfm,"HUD Awards Bartlesville, Oklahoma $500,000 ""Main Street"" Grant","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that the Bartlesville Redevelopment Trust Authority will receive a $500,000 grant to redevelop the Bartlesville, Oklahoma's abandoned Methodist Church and build additional affordable housing units targeted to low-income residents. The grant is funded through HUD's HOPE VI Main Street Program.
The City of Bartlesville, Oklahoma in partnership with Bartlesville Redevelopment Trust Authority (BRTA), Main Street Bartlesville (MSB), Washington County Affordable Housing Coalition (WCAHC), and Ross Group/New Leaf Development (RGNL Development) will use the funding to assist in the reconfiguration of a 90-year-old abandoned church campus into a mixed-use development that will include affordable housing, market rate housing, retail space and hospitality space. The Main Street site will consist of four affordable housing units as a part of an overall 32 unit residential apartment development.
The church redevelopment is part of a new urbanism approach to downtown revitalization promoting walkable neighborhoods with efficient transportation options and access to open space. Additionally, residents will have amenities that include a full-service grocery store and pharmacy, day care facilities, health-care clinic, a university, performing arts venues, a public library, a variety of churches, banks, restaurants, and a public park with a children's amusement park and play area.
""In communities like Bartlesville, a grant like this can not only provide much-needed affordable housing, but also a boost of economic activity,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""Walkable neighborhoods, with access to jobs and groceries, are sustainable neighborhoods where folks can succeed. HUD is proud to be a partner in rebuilding an area like Bartlesville, in need.""
This is the second Main Street grant for Bartlesville. In 2015 the city received a grant to redevelop the former Washington County Memorial Hospital and build additional affordable housing.
The Main Street program seeks to rejuvenate older, downtown business districts while retaining the area's traditional and historic character by providing grants to smaller communities for the development of affordable housing. Such communities must have an ongoing Main Street revitalization effort. Under Main Street, obsolete commercial offices or buildings can be reconfigured into rent producing affordable housing."
07/28/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-113.cfm,Springfield Housing Authority Settles Disputes of Discrimination Against Resident with Disabilities,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that the Springfield Housing Authority in Springfield, MA, has entered into agreements settling allegations of housing discrimination based on disability. The allegations involved an 82-year-old deaf housing authority resident who allegedly did not receive the same access to communications as individuals without disabilities, as required by the Fair Housing Act, Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Read the Conciliation and Voluntary Compliance agreements.
Specifically, the Springfield Housing Authority allegedly refused to grant a reasonable accommodation that would have provided the long-time female resident with the equipment needed to receive the same level of notification available to hearing tenants and allegedly denied her equal access to services they provide to other residents.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from denying or limiting housing to persons with disabilities or from refusing to make reasonable accommodations in policies or practices. Similarly, ADA and Section 504 prohibit certain housing providers from discriminating on the basis of disability, including failing to make reasonable accommodations and modifications, and failing to take appropriate steps to ensure effective communication with individuals with disabilities.
""Today's agreement reaffirms HUD's commitment to ensuring that all housing providers, including housing authorities, understand their obligations under the law and take steps to meet that obligation so that every person has an equal chance to use and enjoy their housing,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity.
The resident was assisted by the Massachusetts Fair Housing Center, a HUD Fair Housing Initiatives Program agency, in filing her complaint. The Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination, a HUD Fair Housing Assistance Program agency, investigated the Title VIII complaint. And HUD investigated the complaint under Section 504 and the ADA. While the investigation was ongoing, the woman and the housing authority agreed to settle the complaint. HUD, the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination and the parties negotiated a Conciliation Agreement with the Commission and a Voluntary Compliance Agreement with HUD.
In addition to the housing authority agreeing to pay a total of $51,000 to the woman, it agreed to cover the $5,000 it will cost to monitor its compliance with the agreement over the next three years. The housing authority also agreed to communicate with the resident via American Sign Language or telephonic video relay communications and to provide a device to allow for a video relay system in her apartment. Finally, the housing authority agreed to consult with disability experts in addressing the needs of deaf tenants and to incorporate the recommendations of the most recent fire safety requirements specifically for the deaf and hard-of-hearing.
In FY 2015, disability was the most common basis of complaints filed with HUD and its partner agencies, being cited as a basis for 4,548 complaints, or nearly 55 percent of the overall total.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to www.hud.gov/fairhousing, or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, which can be accessed through Apple and Android devices."
07/29/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-116.cfm,"HUD Approves Agreement Requiring Citizens Bank/Citizens Bank of Pennsylvania to Pay $115,000 for Allegedly Denying Loan to Woman on Maternity Leave","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has reached a Conciliation Agreement with Philadelphia-based Citizens Bank of Pennsylvania and Providence, Rhode Island-based Citizens Bank, collectively known as Citizens Bank, settling allegations that the bank violated the Fair Housing Act when it told a female applicant that she would need to return to work before her application for a home equity line of credit could be approved.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to discriminate in the terms, conditions, or privileges associated with the sale or rental of a dwelling on the basis of familial status, including denying a mortgage loan or mortgage insurance because a woman is pregnant or on family leave.
""The fact that a woman is on maternity leave should never be the sole reason that she is denied a loan,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD is committed to continuing to enforce fair housing laws and to ensuring that lenders understand their responsibility to treat all qualified applicants the same, even those that are on parental leave.""
The case came to HUD's attention when a woman filed a complaint alleging that Citizens Bank discriminated against her based on her familial status when it delayed the processing of her loan application because she was on maternity leave, despite the fact that she was receiving her full pay.
Under the terms of the agreement, Citizens Bank will pay the woman $40,000, provide fair housing training to its staff, and adopt a parental leave policy making it clear that all loan products are to be made available, regardless of an applicant's parental status. Citizens Bank will also make a $75,000 donation to a HUD-approved fair housing or advocacy organization. Read the agreement with Citizens Bank.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY).

08/01/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-117.cfm,Obama Administration Announces Nearly 50 Percent Decline in Veteran Homelessness,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH) today announced the number of veterans experiencing homelessness in the United States has been cut nearly in half since 2010. The data revealed a 17 percent decrease in veteran homelessness between January 2015 and January 2016—quadruple the previous year's annual decline—and a 47 percent decrease since 2010.
Through HUD's annual Point-in-Time (PIT) estimate of America's homeless population, communities across the country reported that fewer than 40,000 veterans were experiencing homelessness on a given night in January 2016. The January 2016 estimate found just over 13,000 unsheltered homeless veterans living on their streets, a 56 percent decrease since 2010. View local estimates of veteran homelessness (https://www.hudexchange.info/resource/5114/2016-pit-estimate-of-veteran-homelessness-in-the-us/).
This significant progress is a result of the partnership among HUD, VA, USICH, and other federal, state and local partners. These critical partnerships were sparked by the 2010 launch of Opening Doors (https://www.usich.gov/opening-doors), the first-ever strategic plan to prevent and end homelessness. The initiative's success among veterans can also be attributed to the effectiveness of the HUD-VA Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) Program, which combines HUD rental assistance with case management and clinical services provided by the VA. Since 2008, more than 85,000 vouchers have been awarded and more than 114,000 homeless veterans have been served through the HUD-VASH program.
""We have an absolute duty to ensure those who've worn our nation's uniform have a place to call home,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""While we've made remarkable progress toward ending veteran homelessness, we still have work to do to make certain we answer the call of our veterans just as they answered the call of our nation.""
""The dramatic decline in Veteran homelessness reflects the power of partnerships in solving complex national problems on behalf of those who have served our nation,"" said VA Secretary Robert A. McDonald. ""The men and women who have fought for this nation should not have to fight to keep a roof over their head and I'm pleased that VA is serving more Veterans than ever before with heath care, education, job training and wraparound supportive services. While this is very real progress that means tens of thousands more Veterans have a place to call home, we will not rest until every Veteran in need is permanently housed.""
""Together, we are proving that it is possible to solve one of the most complex challenges our country faces,"" said Matthew Doherty, Executive Director of the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness. ""This progress should give us confidence that when we find new ways to work together and when we set bold goals and hold ourselves accountable, nothing is unsolvable.""
In 2014, First Lady Michelle Obama launched the Mayors Challenge to End Veteran Homelessness with the goal of accelerating progress toward the ambitious national goal of ending veteran homelessness. More than 880 mayors, governors, and other local officials have joined the challenge and committed to ending veteran homelessness in their communities. To date, 27 communities and two states have effectively ended veteran homelessness, serving as models for others across the nation.
HUD and VA have a wide range of programs that prevent and end homelessness among veterans, including health care, housing solutions, job training and education. In FY 2015, these programs helped more than 157,000 people—including 99,000 veterans and 34,000 children—secure or remain in permanent housing. Since 2010, more than 360,000 veterans and their families have been permanently housed, rapidly rehoused or prevented from becoming homeless through programs administered by HUD and VA."
08/02/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-118.cfm,HUD Offers $2 Million to Help Students in Assisted Housing Afford College and Continue Education,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced the agency is making $2 million in grants available to help low-income families and young people apply for federal aid for college and other post-secondary educational opportunities. The funding is being offered through HUD's longstanding Resident Opportunities and Self Sufficiency (ROSS) Program. The available funding will support 'Education Navigators' in up to six Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) across the country. Read HUD's Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) (http://go.usa.gov/xgnV5).
Increased access to higher education can significantly improve life outcomes. The Department of Education (www.ed.gov/college) estimates that those who earn a bachelor's degree earn two-thirds more than those with only a high school diploma or an average of $1 million more in lifetime earnings. In addition, college graduates are far less likely to face unemployment. It's also estimated that within the next four years, two-thirds of all new full-time jobs will require a college education.
HUD Secretary Julián Castro said, ""Many families find the cost of higher education prohibitive, but know that a degree or training beyond high school is essential to be competitive in today's 21st century global economy. By helping students access federal financial aid, HUD is lifting up students to overcome financial challenges and reach their full potential.""
HUD's ROSS Program encourages local, innovative strategies that link public housing assistance with public and private resources to enable participating families to increase earned income, reduce or eliminate the need for welfare assistance, and make progress toward achieving economic independence and housing self-sufficiency. The ROSS for Education Program, also known as Project SOAR (Students + Opportunities + Achievements = Results), will support hundreds of young people between the ages of 15-20 to apply for U.S. Department of Education's Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).
Lourdes Castro Ramírez, HUD's Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, added, ""By investing in our youth and communities, we're helping to unlock the promise of higher education for all. Project SOAR will help students in HUD-assisted households to access opportunity and achieve their dreams.""
Project SOAR is one of several HUD initiatives to increase access to federal financial aid for HUD-assisted families and students:
HUD is working with the Department of Education to better understand FASFA completion and educational attainment of HUD-assisted tenants through data sharing. Alongside the White House's Social and Behavioral Sciences Team, HUD is exploring whether behaviorally informed messages can increase completion of the FAFSA among students with housing assistance.

08/04/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-119.cfm,"HUD Announces Agreement with City of Richmond, Virginia to Resolve Discrimination Complaints","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has approved an agreement with the City of Richmond, Virginia, settling 14 complaints of housing discrimination filed against the City by Hispanic residents. The complaints alleged that the City of Richmond selectively enforced its code requirements against residents of the City's mobile home parks, who are predominantly Hispanic.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in housing because of national origin. This includes discriminating against persons because of their national origin when enforcing local housing codes.
The complainants, who are current or former residents of mobile home parks in Richmond, alleged that, due to their national origin, the City imposed unreasonable and legally unjustified requirements that they had to meet to avoid condemnation of their homes; intimidated and harassed them by conducting intrusive inspections with armed police escorts and threatening criminal court action and large monetary fines; and failed to provide meaningful access to residents who have limited English proficiency.
""This agreement helps ensure that all residents in Richmond, regardless of where they live or what ethnicity they are, have equal access and enjoyment of their home,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will continue to work with local governments to create and protect housing opportunities for Hispanic families and others with limited English proficiency.""
Under the terms of the agreement, Richmond will pay $30,000 in damages to some of the complainants, analyze its language access needs, develop a language access plan, and conduct outreach to the Spanish speaking community. The City will also update its Analysis of Impediments to Fair Housing (AI), hold regular meetings with relevant city offices about the AI, and take steps to identify additional funding that mobile home park tenants can use for repairs to their units. Several of the HUD Complainants were plaintiffs in a separate lawsuit filed in Federal Court, and received an additional $40,000 from the City for relocation or home safety repairs. Read the agreement with Richmond here.

08/19/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-123.cfm,HUD Charges Georgia Landlords with Discriminating Against Families with Children,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced it is charging a Georgia couple with housing discrimination for refusing to rent an apartment they owned to a single mother and her son. HUD's investigation alleges landlords James and Ella Collier denied one woman's application because she had a 14-year-old son and that they had a ""NO CHILDREN"" stipulation in multiple lease agreements with other tenants. Read HUD's charge.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from denying or limiting housing to families with children. This includes waiving pet restrictions for assistance animals.
""It's quite simply against the law to deny a person housing simply because they have children living with them,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will continue to take enforcement action whenever the rights of families are violated.""
The case came to HUD's attention when the woman filed a complaint alleging that the Colliers, owners of a number of rental properties in East Point, Georgia, refused to rent an apartment to her after learning she had a 14-year-old son. In August of 2013, the woman noticed a ""For Rent"" sign in the window of one of the Colliers' properties and sought information from the landlords and was asked a series of questions related to her employment and her family size. The woman told HUD that Ella Collier said she ""would not rent to applicants with children.""
HUD's charge further alleges the Colliers inserted discriminatory language into multiple lease agreements of other tenants stipulating, ""NO CHILDREN.""
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he or she may award damages to the complainants for their loss as a result of the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties in order to vindicate the public interest. If the case is heard in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages to the complainant.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to www.hud.gov/fairhousing, or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, which can be accessed through Apple and Android devices."
08/22/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-124.cfm,HUD and VA Announce Additional Support to Help Homeless Veterans Find Permanent Homes,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) today announced a second round of funding to help provide permanent homes to an estimated 108 veterans experiencing homelessness in seven states. The rental assistance announced today is provided through the HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) Program which combines rental assistance from HUD with case management and clinical services provided by VA (see attached list of HUD's voucher awards below).
Recently, HUD, VA and the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH) announced the number of veterans experiencing homelessness in the United States has been cut nearly in half since 2010. The data revealed a 17 percent decrease in veteran homelessness between January 2015 and January 2016—quadruple the previous year's annual decline—and a 47 percent decrease since 2010. Additionally, while answering the Obama administration's Mayor's Challenge to end Veteran's Homelessness, several mayors have declared their cities have officially ended it.
""There is momentum across the nation as community after community effectively ends veteran homelessness,"" said Secretary Julián Castro. ""Today's funding will help more cities reach this important goal and ensure that we serve the brave men and women who have served and sacrificed for us. HUD and its local partners are determined to give every veteran the opportunity to secure a safe, stable place to call home.""
""The dramatic reduction in Veteran homelessness in recent years would not have been possible without the pairing of housing choice vouchers with case management and supportive services under the HUD-VASH program to help the most vulnerable Veterans become and remain stably housed,"" said VA Secretary Robert A. McDonald. ""The HUD-VASH awards announced today will support the ongoing and important work underway to ensure that homelessness among Veterans is rare and non-recurring.""
In June, HUD awarded nearly $38 million to help more than 5,200 homeless veterans find homes. That funding ensured that communities could provide the critically needed housing assistance and case management services to those veterans and their families experiencing homelessness.
In 2010, President Obama and 19 federal agencies and offices that form the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH) launched the nation's first comprehensive strategy to prevent and end homelessness. Opening Doors: Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness (www.usich.gov/opening_doors/) serves as a roadmap for how the federal government will work with state and local communities to confront the root causes of homelessness, especially among former servicemen and women. To support communities as they progress towards the goal of ending veteran homelessness, USICH has identified strategies that increase collaboration and coordination among programs serving veterans experiencing homelessness.
Since 2008, more than 79,000 vouchers have been awarded and approximately 111,000 homeless veterans have been served through the HUD-VASH program. Rental assistance and supportive services provided through HUD-VASH are a critical resource for local communities in ending homelessness among our nation's Veterans.
In the HUD-VASH program, VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) assess veterans experiencing homelessness before referring them to local housing agencies for these vouchers. Decisions are based on a variety of factors, most importantly the duration of homelessness and the need for longer term, more intensive support in obtaining and maintaining permanent housing. The HUD-VASH program includes both the rental assistance the voucher provides and the comprehensive case management that VAMC staff offers.
Veterans participating in the HUD-VASH program rent privately owned housing and generally contribute no more than 30 percent of their income toward rent. VA offers eligible homeless veterans clinical and supportive services through its medical centers across the U.S., Guam, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands."

If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. Changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show irregular movement. It takes 3 months to establish a trend for new houses sold. Preliminary new home sales figures are subject to revision due to the survey methodology and definitions used. The survey is primarily based on a sample of houses selected from building permits. Since a ""sale"" is defined as a deposit taken or sales agreement signed, this can occur prior to a permit being issued. An estimate of these prior sales is included in the sales figure. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimate of total sales is revised about 4 percent. Changes in sales price data reflect changes in the distribution of houses by region, size, etc., as well as changes in the prices of houses with identical characteristics.

08/23/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-126.cfm,HUD Reaches Agreement with Florida Condo Association in Disability Discrimination Case,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today an agreement with Delvista Towers Condominium Association, Inc., of Aventura, Florida, and its property management company, resolving allegations of housing discrimination against residents with disabilities. HUD claimed the condo association and its property managers denied the reasonable accommodation requests of residents with disabilities who needed assistance animals. Read the Conciliation Agreement.
The Fair Housing Act makes it illegal to discriminate in the terms and conditions of housing to an individual based on a disability, including denying reasonable accommodations or making them unavailable. This includes refusing to permit persons with disabilities to have assistance animals when necessary.
""People who have a disability and need a reasonable accommodation in order to live comfortably in their home shouldn't be denied that accommodation,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""This agreement reflects HUD's ongoing commitment to ensuring that housing providers meet their obligation to comply with the nation's fair housing laws.""
HUD initiated a discrimination complaint in April 2014 after receiving several reports from residents of Delvista Towers claiming their rights were being violated because of their disability. One resident alleged her request for a service animal for her son had been denied. Specifically, the woman said that when she contacted the property manager about her son's need for the reasonable accommodation, she was told that the request would not be approved and that the condominium was ""currently involved in very expensive lawsuits with other residents regarding service animals."" The woman further alleged that she was denied the opportunity to renew her lease because she mentioned her son's need for a service animal.
HUD's investigation indicated that other residents with disabilities were also denied their requests for assistance animals or refrained from requesting an accommodation for fear of being evicted.
Under the Conciliation Agreement, Delvista and its property management company, AKAM On-Site of Dania Beach, Fla., agreed to compensate one of the aggrieved persons and to donate to a non-profit disability rights organization. They also agreed to develop a reasonable accommodation policy that will be reviewed and approved by HUD and to provide for training of board members and property managers on the new policy and the Fair Housing Act.
Any person who believes he or she has experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY).

08/25/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-127.cfm,FHA Streamlines Process to Help Delinquent Homeowners Avoid Foreclosure and Remain in Their Homes,"WASHINGTON - The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) today announced new procedures to strengthen the process mortgage servicers use to help struggling families avoid foreclosure and remain in their homes. FHA is streamlining its loss mitigation protocols that servicers must use when evaluating and deploying 'home retention options,' foreclosure alternatives that allow delinquent borrowers to retain their home. Read FHA's mortgagee letter.
FHA's revised procedures streamline the process servicers use to engage borrowers, specifically when evaluating them for the FHA-Home Affordable Modification Program (FHA-HAMP). These changes will reduce the number of steps that a servicer and borrower must take to resolve a delinquency and enter into a loss mitigation home retention product. In addition, FHA is removing certain obstacles that will allow servicers greater flexibility for evaluating an unemployed borrower for a special forbearance agreement.
Specifically, FHA will:
Require servicers to convert successful 3-month trial modifications into permanent modifications within 60 days instead of the average four-to-six months; Allow borrowers with three missed mortgage payments to qualify for a partial claim to bring their arrearages current versus the previous requirement for a minimum of four missed payments; End the traditional stand-alone Loan Modification option so struggling borrowers can access the FHA-HAMP option, with its greater payment relief, sooner; and Eliminate the required 12-monthterm for FHA's special forbearance option. This will allow servicers to offer this option to more unemployed households.
• Require servicers to convert successful 3-month trial modifications into permanent modifications within 60 days instead of the average four-to-six months;

08/26/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-128.cfm,HUD Expands Family Self-Sufficiency Program to Privately Owned Multifamily Properties,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced today that owners of privately owned apartment buildings under Section 8 contract can now offer Family Self-Sufficiency programs to the more than one million households living in their properties. HUD will now allow owners of multifamily properties to use funding from residual receipt accounts to hire service coordinators for their own Family Self-Sufficiency program. Read HUD's notice to multifamily property owners.
Family Self Sufficiency (FSS) is a HUD program that provides incentives and supports to help families living in multifamily assisted housing to increase their earned income and reduce their dependence on public assistance programs. FSS promotes the development of local strategies to coordinate the use of HUD rental assistance programs with public and private resources, to enable eligible families to make progress toward economic independence and self-sufficiency.
Residents who choose to participate in HUD's FSS program will be paired with service coordinators who will guide them in developing self-sufficiency goals. They will also sign a five-year contract requiring the head of the household to obtain employment and for all family members to be free of public assistance for one year before the contract ends.
In addition, service providers will help participating residents to establish an interest-bearing escrow account. Deposits to this account occur when the family's rent increases as a result of higher earned income during the contract period. Upon graduation from the program, the family may use the escrow funds to build assets, such as a down payment on a home. During the first year of its expanded reach, the Family Self-Sufficiency program has the potential to impact thousands of families nationwide.
HUD evaluated the original format of the FSS program in 2011 and found that participants who completed the program were more likely to be employed and to earn higher incomes. HUD continues to evaluate the program and anticipates sharing updated findings by 2018."
08/31/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-129.cfm,HUD Proposes New Rule to Help Children Exposed to Lead Paint Hazards,"WASHINGTON - In an effort to immediately help young children with elevated blood lead levels living in federally assisted housing, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is proposing to lower the Department's threshold of lead in the child's blood to match the one used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). HUD's proposed new reference level for lead in a young child's blood would be lowered from 20 micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood (µg/dL) to five, and continue to be aligned with CDC recommendations in the future. Read HUD's proposed rule (https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-09-01/pdf/2016-20955.pdf).
This important change to HUD's 17-year-old Lead Safe Housing Rule will allow for an earlier response when a child under six years old is exposed to lead-based paint hazards in their HUD-assisted homes. HUD Secretary Julián Castro made the announcement today with Sen. Jack Reed while inspecting a home where HUD helped to clean up the lead paint hazards.
""There is no amount of lead in a child's blood that can be considered safe,"" said HUD Secretary Castro. ""We have an obligation to the families we serve to protect their children. By aligning our standard with the one used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we can act more quickly and make certain the homes we support are as safe as possible. This proposed rule is the centerpiece of HUD's intensified efforts to protect our next generation from debilitating lead poisoning.""
""Lead poisoning prevents kids from reaching their full potential, and it costs the public millions of dollars each year. Secretary Castro has emphasized community engagement, and I am pleased he is here in Rhode Island to meet with local leaders to address this threat and to highlight new tools and initiatives to prevent childhood lead poisoning,"" said Senator Reed, a Congressional champion for eliminating lead-based paint hazards and the Ranking Member of the Senate Appropriations Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Subcommittee. ""Secretary Castro has been a true leader in advocating for children and families in need and has renewed HUD's focus on the prevention of childhood lead poisoning. The steps we are announcing today are immediate, cost-effective measures that will change the lives of children living in low-income housing. It is important that we continue to work together, across the housing, education, and public health sectors, to continue to address childhood lead poisoning.""
HUD-assisted housing has fewer lead-based paint hazards than unassisted low- and middle-income homes. Still, some young children living in HUD-assisted properties have blood lead levels higher than CDC's threshold. By lowering HUD's reference level to conform to CDC's, the Department will be able to intervene more quickly to stop the negative impact lead can have on the lives of children.
When a child under the age of six resides in HUD-assisted housing and experiences elevated blood levels, the housing provider would be required to report the case to HUD so the Department can launch an immediate environmental investigation. If it is determined that lead-based paint or lead-contaminated soil is the cause of the child's exposure, the housing provider must clean up those hazards.
This proposed rule will potentially cover an estimated 2.9 million HUD-assisted housing units built before 1978, the year lead-based paint was banned for residential use. Of these homes, approximately 490,000 are estimated to have children under six residing in them, and 128,000 of those are estimated to contain lead-based paint.
HUD has a long history of working to ensure lead-safe housing, which fits into the broader federal response to address lead hazards found in paint, dust and soil, and other sources like water and consumer goods. For 25 years, HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes has worked to improve methods to identify and address home-related health and safety hazards, including lead. Since 1993, HUD has awarded more than $1.58 billion in grants to communities for identification and control of lead-based paint hazards in over 190,000 low-income privately owned housing units. In addition, HUD continues to support research on best practices for identifying and controlling lead-based paint hazards, and conduct an outreach program to get out the message.
HUD's key federal partners share an extensive history of work to prevent children's lead exposure. The CDC's Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program has developed programs and policies to prevent childhood lead poisoning and provided funding to state and local health departments to determine the extent of childhood lead poisoning. The Environmental Protection Agency's lead-based paint program has increased the quality of training of lead inspectors, renovation professionals and abatement firms who work on older homes.
The effects of lead poisoning are irreversible. Even at low levels, lead exposure can have long-term effects on a young child's ability to learn and lead a productive life. In addition to today's announcement, HUD recently announced The Lead-Safe Homes, Lead-Free Kids Toolkit, a set of guidelines and recommendations for ensuring HUD housing is lead-safe, and the Healthy Homes App (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gov.hud.healthyhomesbasics), which provides consumers with information about potentially serious health and safety problems in the home, and the steps they can take to protect themselves.
This proposed rule will be open for public comment for the next 60 days. Interested persons may submit comments electronically at www.regulations.gov. Comments may also be submitted by mail to the Regulations Divisions, Office of General Counsel, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 7thStreet SW, Room 10276, Washington, DC 20410."
09/01/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-130.cfm,HUD Charges Pittsburgh-Area Landlords with Housing Discrimination Based on Disability,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is charging a group of landlords in the Pittsburgh area with discriminating againstprospective residents who have disabilities. HUD claims the owners and property managers of Beechwood Gardens in Pittsburgh and Southpointe Towers in West Mifflin denied housing to testers posing as prospective renters by refusing to grant them reasonable accommodations. Read HUD's charge.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in the terms and conditions of housing because of disability. This includes refusing to permit persons with disabilities to have needed assistance animals or other reasonable accommodations.
""Fair housing laws are clear—a disability should never prevent you from living in a safe, accessible home,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""This charge reflects HUD's commitment to ensuring that housing providers everywhere meet their fair housing obligations and offer equal access to every person looking to rent or buy a home.""
The case came to HUD's attention when the Fair Housing Partnership of Pittsburgh, Inc., filed a complaint alleging that A.Z. Zytnick, LLC, S & J Ventures, LP and the Allan Zytnick Trust Fund discriminated against prospective renters with disabilities. The parties own and/or manage the 144-unit Beechwood Gardens apartments in Pittsburgh and the 157-unit Southpointe Towers apartments in West Mifflin.
HUD's charge alleges that the owners and managers at Southpointe Towers sent residents a notice stating that there would ""no longer be any assigned [parking] spaces, no exceptions, even for people with disabilities."" The Fair Housing Partnership of Pittsburgh conducted a series of tests using testers posing as rental applicants who required designated parking spaces due to mobility disabilities. HUD alleges that respondents denied these testers requests for assigned parking at both Southpointe and Beechwood Gardens.
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he or she may award damages to the complainant for its loss as a result of the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties in order to vindicate the public interest. If the case is heard in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages to the complainant.

09/08/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-132.cfm,HUD Approves Settlement Between City of Phoenix and Fair Housing Organizations,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced today an agreement between the City of Phoenix, Arizona and two fair housing organizations resolving multiple complaints of housing discrimination. The Southwest Fair Housing Council (SFHC) and the Arizona Fair Housing Center (AFHC) alleged Phoenix violated the Fair Housing Act, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in its administration of the City's federally funded Housing Choice Voucher program.
Specifically, the organizations claimed the city did not make its online pre-application process accessible to persons with disabilities, provided vital documents in English only, and failed to notify applicants with limited English proficiency (LEP) that they could request language assistance. Read the agreement.
""Decent, safe affordable housing provides the foundation low-income families need to build a better life and should be offered on an equal basis,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD commends Phoenix city leaders for their swift action and for agreeing to change their subsidized housing application process so that it is consistent with our nation's fair housing laws.""
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin in programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance, including the failure to take reasonable steps to ensure meaningful access to programs and activities by LEP persons. The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to discriminate in the rental or sale of housing or to impose different terms and conditions based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, and disability. Section 504 and Title II of the ADA prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability in programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance and by state and local government entities.
The case came to HUD's attention when SFHC and AFHC filed a complaint alleging the City of Phoenix engaged in discriminatory housing practices, including how the City's housing authority managed its HUD-supported Housing Choice Voucher program. According to the complaint, the program, which had not been open to new applications since 2005, was due to be opened for new applicants in early August, 2016. Shortly before the scheduled opening, the groups filed their complaint.
According to the agreement, after the complaint was filed, the city of Phoenix immediately adjusted its processes to ensure that they comply with civil rights laws. In addition, the city, prior to entering into the agreement, extended the period of time that its waiting list would be open and issued a press release announcing the extension to ensure that prospective applicants would have the opportunity to benefit from the changes.
Under the terms of the agreement, the city of Phoenix also will continue accepting both online and paper pre-applications for the Housing Choice Voucher program; continue providing reasonable accommodations to people with disabilities, including accepting pre-applications over the phone, providing one-on-one assistance to people with disabilities in completing their applications, and providing interpreter services to applicants who are deaf or hard of hearing; continue providing oral language assistance, including interpreter service, to LEP persons who need assistance in the application process; continue ensuring staff are available during business hours to respond to reasonable accommodation and language assistance requests; continue to prominently display on its website the availability of language assistance and reasonable accommodations; post the particulars of the Conciliation/Voluntary Compliance Agreement on its website in English, Spanish, Arabic, Vietnamese, and Chinese; and obtain fair housing training for its staff.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed at www.hud.gov/fairhousing or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, which can be accessed through Apple and Android devices."
09/12/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-133.cfm,HUD Awards More Than $56 Million for Housing and Community Development Projects in 77 Tribal Communities,"WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) awarded $56.5 million to 77 Native American communities throughout the country to improve housing conditions and stimulate community development for residents, including funding construction projects and local jobs. The grants are part of HUD's Indian Community Development Block Grant (ICDBG) Program, which supports a wide range of community development and affordable housing activities. See a list of award winners below, and read individual project summaries here.
""This investment will expand affordable housing and economic opportunities for families in Native American communities across the country,"" said HUD Principal Deputy Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, Lourdes Castro Ramírez. ""We are proud to continue collaborating with tribal leaders to improve housing conditions and to lift up neighborhoods with vital new infrastructure and vibrant community spaces.""
The ICDBG program was established in 1977 to help Indian tribes and Alaska Native villages meet their community development needs. Federally recognized Indian tribes, bands, groups or nations (including Alaska Indian, Aleuts and Eskimos,) Alaska Native villages, and eligible tribal organizations compete for this funding each year.
The goal of the program is to develop viable Indian and Alaska Native communities, including neighborhoods with decent housing, suitable living environments, and economic opportunities. Communities can use the grants to rehab or build new housing; to buy land for housing; for infrastructure projects such as roads, water and sewer facilities; and to spur economic development including jobs.
This year's projects include building or fixing homes for many of the awardees. Other uses include theAll Mission Indian Housing Authorityof the La Jolla Reservation in California using $605,000 to provide the west side of its community with much needed water. To address the effects of the ongoing drought in California, the tribe has three water infrastructure improvements planned. Near Auburn, Washington, the Muckleshoot Housing Authoritywill use its $500,000 grant to improve 10 housing units, making them more energy-efficient and creating three jobs in the process. Near the City of El Reno, Oklahoma, the Cheyenne-Arapaho Tribe will use its $800,000 grant to construct the Concho Head Start Center which will include five classrooms and a large multi-purpose room to serve 57 low-income children and their familieswith programming to address their educational, emotional, social, cultural, health, nutritional, and psychological needs.
HUD administers seven programs that are specifically targeted to American Indian, Alaska Native, or Native Hawaiian individuals and families, and federally recognized tribal governments. HUD will provide $798 million in FY 2017 to fund programs that support housing and development initiatives in American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian communities. Through innovative programming, American Indian and Alaska Native tribal governments have created sustainable and community-driven solutions to their housing and community development challenges.

09/13/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-134.cfm,HUD Announces New Protections for Victims of Harassment and Survivors of Domestic Violence,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced today that it is publishing a final rule (https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/09/14/2016-21868/quid-pro-quo-and-hostile-environment-harassment-and-liability-for-discriminatory-housing-practices) formalizing legal standards under the Fair Housing Act for sexual and other forms of harassment in housing. In addition, HUD is issuing Fair Housing Act guidance on local 'nuisance ordinances' that may lead to housing discrimination against survivors of domestic violence and other persons in need of emergency services.
HUD is issuing its Nuisance Guidance as the country marks the 22nd anniversary of the Violence Against Women's Act (VAWA). Through the VAWA 2013 reauthorization, protections have been expanded to nearly all HUD programs. Previously, only residents of public housing and Section 8 tenant-based and project-based programs were covered.
HUD's final Harassment Rule is titled Quid Pro Quo and Hostile Environment Harassment and Liability for Discriminatory Housing Practices under the Fair Housing Act. HUD and courts have long held that harassment in housing or housing-related transactions on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, disability, and familial status is prohibited under the Fair Housing Act. The final rule specifies how HUD will evaluate claims of ""hostile environment"" and ""quid pro quo"" harassment in both private and publicly-assisted housing.
HUD's Guidance on Application of Fair Housing Act Standards to the Enforcement of Local Nuisance and Crime-Free Housing Ordinances Against Victims of Domestic Violence, Other Crime Victims, and Others Who Require Police or Emergency Servicesis intended to inform state and local governments, as well as private and public housing providers, as to how HUD will assess nuisance or crime-free housing ordinances, policies, or practices alleged to be discriminatory under the Fair Housing Act.
These local ordinances may be used to evict domestic violence survivors and others who seek police or emergency assistance.
""On the 22nd anniversary of the Violence Against Women Act, HUD makes it clear that no one should have to choose between calling 9-1-1 and being evicted,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""A home should be a sanctuary where everyone can live without the threat of violence or harassment. The actions we take today will work together to protect the housing rights of victims of harassment and survivors of domestic violence.""
Harassment in housing threatens a resident's safety and privacy in her own home. In HUD's experience enforcing the Fair Housing Act, low-income women—often racial and ethnic minorities and persons with disabilities—may be particularly vulnerable to sexual harassment in housing. HUD's final rule on harassment in housing includes:
Formal uniform standards for evaluating claims of hostile environment and quid pro quo harassment in the housing context. Quid Pro Quo Harassment involves subjecting a person to an unwelcome request or demand and making submission to the request or demand a condition related to the person's housing. Hostile Environment Harassment involves subjecting a person to unwelcome conduct that is sufficiently severe or pervasive such that it interferes with or deprives the person of the right to use and enjoy the housing. Clarification as to when housing providers and other covered entities or individuals may be held directly or vicariously liable under the Fair Housing Act for illegal harassment or other discriminatory housing practices.
• Formal uniform standards for evaluating claims of hostile environment and quid pro quo harassment in the housing context. Quid Pro Quo Harassment involves subjecting a person to an unwelcome request or demand and making submission to the request or demand a condition related to the person's housing. Hostile Environment Harassment involves subjecting a person to unwelcome conduct that is sufficiently severe or pervasive such that it interferes with or deprives the person of the right to use and enjoy the housing.
Quid Pro Quo Harassment involves subjecting a person to an unwelcome request or demand and making submission to the request or demand a condition related to the person's housing.

• Clarification as to when housing providers and other covered entities or individuals may be held directly or vicariously liable under the Fair Housing Act for illegal harassment or other discriminatory housing practices.
HUD aggressively pursues violations involving harassment in housing, including, most recently, charging St. Louis landlords with sexual harassment against a female tenant. The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against these landlords (https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-files-sexual-harassment-lawsuit-against-two-st-louis-landlords).
The Nuisance Ordinance Guidance addresses ordinances that penalize residents for a small number of 911 calls to police, even when a person is in need of protection from domestic violence or another crime. Nuisance ordinances often require or allow landlords to evict residents in such circumstances, thereby discouraging victims from reporting domestic abuse or other crimes and obtaining the emergency police and medical assistance they need.
HUD investigated and resolved a complaint brought by a woman living in Norristown, Pennsylvania, who had been subjected to domestic violence by her ex-boyfriend. Police warned her that if she made one more 911 call, she and her young daughter would be evicted from their home. The Norristown ordinance operated under a ""three strike"" policy, allowing no more than two calls to 911 for help. As a result, the woman was too afraid to call the police when her ex-boyfriend returned to her home and stabbed her. A neighbor called the police. A few days after the woman's release from the hospital, she was served with eviction papers pursuant to the local nuisance ordinance. As a part of the settlement, the city repealed the ordinance. These types of ordinances violate the Fair Housing Act when they have an unjustified discriminatory effect or are enacted or enforced to intentionally discriminate because of a protected characteristic. Read more about this case.
Anyone who believes she or he has experienced discrimination in housing may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to www.hud.gov/fairhousing, or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, which can be accessed through Apple or Android devices."
09/15/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-135.cfm,HUD Issues New Guidance on Fair Housing Protections for People with Limited English Proficiency,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today issued ""Limited English Proficiency"" (LEP) guidance that addresses how the Fair Housing Act would apply to claims of housing discrimination brought by people because they do not speak, read, or write English proficiently. More than 25 million people in the United States do not communicate proficiently in English. Read the new limited English proficiency guidance here.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits both intentional housing discrimination and housing practices that have an unjustified discriminatory effect. People with limited English proficiency are not a protected class under the Fair Housing Act. However, the Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination on seven protected bases, including national origin, which is closely linked to the ability to communicate proficiently in English.
Housing providers are therefore prohibited from using limited English proficiency selectively or as an excuse for intentional housing discrimination. The law also prohibits landlords from using limited English proficiency in a way that causes an unjustified discriminatory effect.
""Having a limited ability to speak English should never be a reason to be denied a home,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Every family that calls this nation home has the same rights when it comes to renting or buying a home, regardless of where they come from or language they speak.""
Nearly 9 percent of the U.S. population is limited in English proficiency. Approximately 16,350,000 (or 65 percent) of these individuals speak Spanish, while 1,660,000 (7 percent) speak Chinese, 850,000 (3 percent) speak Vietnamese, 620,000 (2 percent) speak Korean and 530,000 (2 percent) speak Tagalog. Housing decisions that are based on limited English proficiency may have a greater impact on these and other groups because of their nationality.
The guidance addresses how various legal approaches, such as discriminatory effects and disparate treatment, apply in Fair Housing Act cases in which a housing-related decision - such as a landlord's refusal to rent or renew a lease - involves a person's limited ability to speak, read, write, or understand English.
Discriminatory practices, for example, could include applying a language-related requirement to people of certain races or nationalities; posting advertisements that contain blanket statements, such as ""all tenants must speak English;"" or immediately turning away applicants who are not fluent in English. Targeting racial or national origin groups for scams related to housing also constitutes intentional discrimination.
A housing provider also violates the Fair Housing Act when the provider's policies or practices have an unjustified discriminatory effect, even when the provider had not intended to discriminate. Determining whether a practice has a discriminatory effect involves a three-step legal evaluation of the statistical evidence of a discriminatory effect; whether the housing provider's policy or practice is necessary to achieve a substantial, legitimate, nondiscriminatory interest; and, if so, whether there is a less discriminatory alternative policy or practice.
In addition to the new LEP guidance, which is limited to the Fair Housing Act, HUD published a ""Notice of Guidance to Federal Financial Assistance Recipients Regarding Title VI Prohibition Against National Origin Discrimination Affecting Limited English Proficient Persons"" in 2007.
Any person who believes he or she has experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to www.hud.gov/fairhousing, or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, which can be accessed through Apple and Android devices."
09/16/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-136.cfm,HUD-CDC Study Finds Children Living in Federally Supported Housing have Lower Levels of Lead in their Blood than Unassisted Children,"WASHINGTON - The average amount of potentially harmful lead in the blood of children in low-income families living in federally assisted housing is significantly lower than comparable children not living in federally assisted housing. That's the principle conclusion of a study by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published today in the American Journal of Public Health http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2016.303432. According to the joint HUD-CDC study, children living in federally supported housing have approximately 20 percent lower blood lead levels on average, than similar children in low-income families living in homes where there is no federal assistance.
The analysis initially revealed that average blood lead levels for children living in HUD-assisted housing were not significantly different than children living in unassisted housing. However, after considering demographic, socioeconomic and family characteristics, and focusing on families living below two times the national poverty level, children who live in federally assisted housing had significantly lower average blood lead levels than their un-assisted counterparts.
Researchers examined data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2005-2012. HUD and CDC then examined 1999-2014 administrative data for HUD's largest rental assistance programs. By comparing these records, HUD and CDC identified the blood lead levels of approximately 150 young children (ages 1-5) living in federally assisted housing and the blood lead levels of approximately 1000 young children whose families received no housing assistance during 1999-2014.
In the group of children with family incomes less than twice the poverty threshold, the unadjusted average blood lead level among those living in federally assisted housing at the time of their examination was not significantly different from non-housing-assisted children. However, after accounting for demographic, socioeconomic, and family characteristics, the difference in blood lead levels in these two populations of children became statistically significant. Young children living in federally supported housing showed an average level of 1.44 micrograms per deciliter of blood (µg/dL) compared with 1.79 µg/dL for similar children living in unassisted housing.
Last month, HUD proposed a new rule to further protect young children living in federally assisted housing by lowering the Department's threshold of lead in the child's blood to match the standard used by CDC. HUD's proposed 'reference level' for lead in a young child's blood would be lowered from 20 µg/dL to 5 µg/dL, and continue to be aligned with CDC recommendations in the future. This important change to HUD's 17-year-old Lead Safe Housing Rule will allow for an earlier response when a child under six years old is exposed to lead-based paint hazards in their HUD-assisted homes.

HUD also announced The Lead-Safe Homes, Lead-Free Kids Toolkit, to help ensure HUD housing is lead-safe and launched the new Healthy Homes App (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gov.hud.healthyhomesbasics""), which provides consumers with information about potentially serious health and safety problems in the home, and the steps they can take to protect themselves."
09/19/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-138.cfm,Jon Gresley Named HUD Pacific Regional Administrator,"SAN FRANCISCO - Today, U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Julián Castro named Jon Gresley to serve as HUD's Regional Administrator in Region 9, which includes the western states of Arizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada, and the U.S. territories in the Outer Pacific.
In his new position, Gresley will serve as HUD's chief liaison to state and local elected officials, congressional delegations, and other stakeholders throughout this region. He will work closely with senior officials of other federal agencies to effectively leverage resources and implement Administration-wide initiatives. He will also coordinate the delivery of HUD programmatic and financial support in housing, community and economic development to the numerous housing authorities, federally recognized tribes, state and local governments, and thousands of other stakeholders in the region.
""I'm thrilled Jon's bringing his years of experience to HUD,"" said Secretary Castro. ""He's been deeply involved in managing a large portfolio of public housing and improving living conditions for thousands of families over the years. Jon began his housing career with HUD. We're happy to welcome him home.""
After serving in the Peace Corps in the Philippines, Gresley joined HUD as an urban intern in the early 1970s and quickly moved into positions of housing management. He served as the Deputy Executive Director of the Oakland Housing Authority in 1980 and from 1999-2010, he was the agency's Executive Director. During his tenure, that agency gained national and international recognition for innovative affordable housing strategies including working closely with the Alameda County Sherriff's Department to establish the MOMs (Maximizing Opportunities for Mothers to Succeed) Program, an effort to provide affordable housing opportunities to justice-involved mothers being re-united with their children and transitioning back into society after incarceration.
In addition, Gresley collaborated with non-profit and for profit developers in an effort to revitalize 394 units of severely distressed public housing with 1096 units of attractive, affordable, mixed-income rental apartments and homeownership homes.
Gresley has received numerous awards for his leadership in the affordable housing arena and has served in leadership roles for a number of local and national non-profit organizations. He earned a B.A. degree from DePauw University and an MBA with honors from St. Mary's College of California."
09/20/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-137.cfm,HUD Issues Final Rule to Ensure Equal Access to Housing and Services Regardless of Gender Identity,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today published a final rule to ensure that all individuals have equal access to many of the Department's core shelter programs in accordance with their gender identity. Read HUD's new 'Gender Identity Rule' (https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2016-22589.pdf).
Following what had previously been a practice encouraged by HUD, providers that operate single-sex projects using funds awarded through the Department's Office of Community Planning and Development (CPD) will now be required to provide all individuals, including transgender individuals and other individuals who do not identify with the sex they were assigned at birth, with access to programs, benefits, services, and accommodations in accordance with their gender identity without being subjected to intrusive questioning or being asked to provide documentation.
""Today, we take another important step to ensure full acceptance of transgender and gender non-conforming individuals in the programs HUD supports,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""This new rule will ensure equal access to the very programs that help to prevent homelessness for persons who are routinely forced to choose between being placed in facilities against their gender identity or living on our streets.""
HUD's new rule will require a recipient, subrecipient, or provider to establish, amend, or maintain program admissions, occupancy, and operating policies and procedures (including policies and procedures to protect individuals' privacy and security), so that equal access is provided to individuals based on their gender identity. This requirement includes tenant selection and admission preferences.
HUD's mission is to create inclusive communities and quality affordable housing for all. Excluding any eligible person from HUD-funded temporary, emergency shelters, buildings, facilities, housing or programs because of that person's gender identity or nonconformance with gender stereotypes would contravene this responsibility.
Background
In February of 2012, HUD published an Equal Access Rule to make certain that housing assisted or insured by HUD is open to all eligible individuals and families without regard to actual or perceived sexual orientation, gender identity or marital status. That rule provided a limited exception in cases involving single-sex emergency shelters with shared sleeping areas or bathrooms. At that time, HUD decided not to set national policy regarding how transgender persons would be accommodated in in these facilities, but instead decided to monitor and review its programs to determine if additional guidance or a national policy was warranted.
Since the publication of the Equal Access Rule, HUD conducted further review on transgender individuals' ability to access single-sex facilities. As a result of its review, HUD determined that the 2012 Equal Access Rule did not adequately address the significant barriers faced by transgender and gender nonconforming persons when accessing single-sex facilities, and that transgender and gender nonconforming persons continue to experience significant violence, harassment, and discrimination in attempting to access programs, benefits, services, and accommodations. Homeless service providers reported that, if given the choice between a shelter designated for their assigned birth sex or sleeping on the streets, many transgender shelter-seekers would choose the streets.
Transgender women in particular reported that they are excluded from women's shelters, forcing them to live on the streets or to seek shelter in male-only facilities where they're forced to disguise their gender identity or face abuse or violence. In January 2016, the Center for American Progress released the results of a discrimination telephone test across four states that measured the degree to which transgender homeless women can access a shelter in accordance with their gender identity, as well as the types of discrimination and mistreatment they face in the process.[1] The study found that only 30 percent of the shelters contacted by the testers were willing to house the transgender women with other women.
HUD also reviewed national research which revealed that lack of access to shelter for transgender and gender nonconforming persons, particularly those who were also homeless youths, was a pervasive problem. National research indicates that these denials of access based upon an individual's gender identity are commonplace. According to a national survey by the National Center for Transgender Equality, nearly half (47 percent) of all transgender respondents who accessed shelters left those shelters because of the treatment they received there—choosing life on the street over the abuse and indignity they experienced in a shelter. This survey further reported that 25 percent of transgender individuals who stayed in shelters were physically assaulted, and 22 percent were sexually assaulted, by another resident or shelter staff.

The August rate for units in buildings with five units or more was 283,000.
EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take two months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, 4 months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2%) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90-percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised about three percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found on our web site listed above.
* 90% confidence interval includes zero. The Census Bureau does not have sufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero.

09/21/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-140.cfm,"HUD Announces Agreement with Ridgeland, Mississippi to Settle Discriminatory Zoning Complaint","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today an agreement with Ridgeland, Mississippi to resolve complaints the city violated the Fair Housing Act when it passed and enforced a zoning ordinance that HUD claimed was motivated by racial animus and created a discriminatory effect on the city's African American residents. Read the agreement.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful for cities and municipalities to enact housing ordinances that discriminate based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, or disability.
""While zoning is the primary responsibility of local government, it cannot be used as a vehicle for discriminating against minority families through a campaign of depopulation,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Everyone, regardless of their race, should have the opportunity to live where they choose and HUD will continue to take appropriate action when that right is violated.""
In December of 2015, HUD filed a fair housing complaint against the city after receiving reports that a number of apartment complexes faced possible demolition after the city instituted a new zoning requirement that lowered the allowable density. Specifically, HUD complained the city's new zoning ordinance called for several of the apartment complexes with the highest minority populations to be amortized, putting more than 1,400 units at risk of being replaced with mixed-use developments. HUD also alleged that other majority minority complexes were subjected to lower density restrictions, which could have resulted in a loss of hundreds of additional apartment units.
Under the Conciliation Agreement, the city of Ridgeland agrees to amend the 2014 Ordinance so that multifamily properties are treated as they were prior to the Ordinance when it comes to use and density; provide notice to property managers and/or owners of multifamily properties in advance of any public hearings contemplating changes to existing zoning, land use, and occupancy policies; and process all zoning, land use, building and occupancy approvals and permits in good faith and in a timely manner. The city also agreed to submit to HUD a proposed Affordable and Fair Housing Marketing Plan which encourages the development of mixed income communities and provides tangible steps for conducting outreach and engaging the residents of Southeastern Ridgeland in the community planning process.
Any person who believes he or she has experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to www.hud.gov/fairhousing, or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, whichcan be accessed through Apple and Android devices."
09/21/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-141.cfm,HUD Publishes Evaluation of Rental Assistance Demonstration,"WASHINGTON - In 2012, Congress authorized the Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) to test a new way of meeting the large and growing capital improvement needs of the nation's aging public housing stock. New research released today by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), conducted by Econometrica Inc., examines how RAD is performing and provides evidence that the program is on track to accomplish its primary goal of attracting substantial new capital to stabilize the physical and financial conditions of public housing properties significantly improving housing conditions for low-income residents.
HUD's Rental Assistance Demonstration Interim Report finds that by October of 2015, public housing authorities choosing to participate in the program successfully generated $2.5 billion in new investment to preserve and improve their public housing stock. HUD's evaluation discovered that early adopters of RAD leveraged $9 in capital for every $1 of public housing funds, proving the program capable of stimulating critically needed capital infusion to modernize and transform the nation's public housing stock for low-income families, elderly, and people with disabilities. PHAs have continued to have significant success leveraging funds for modernization and, to-date, have attracted over $60,000 per unit on average to replace outdated kitchens and baths, install energy and water efficient appliances, and make other critical improvements to preserve and, where needed, transform this affordable housing stock.
""The Rental Assistance Demonstration is attracting substantial investment in a budget environment where public dollars simply can't keep pace with the growing backlog of capital needs facing our public housing authorities,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""The early returns are in and RAD is proving itself to be an exciting new tool that allows us to ensure safe, quality housing for low-income Americans. As we continue to evaluate this demonstration, it's already clear that RAD is helping to preserve an important piece of our nation's affordable housing stock.""
In 2010, a study prepared for HUD estimated the backlog of capital needs among the nearly 1.2 million public housing units to be approximately $26 billion, with each subsequent year accruing an additional $3.4 billion in capital needs.[1] Federal appropriations have been unable to keep pace with these growing capital needs. As a result, an estimated 10,000 public housing units fall into disrepair each year and are removed from operation. RAD was authorized by Congress to help stem the loss of public housing units by allowing local housing authorities to ""convert"" the current federal subsidy to a more stable long-term financing model for up to 185,000 public housing units.
Just as private owners of single- and multi-family housing routinely rely upon debt financing as a means of undertaking physical improvements to their properties, RAD allows public housing authorities to safely leverage other sources of private capital, typically debt and equity, in order to finance rehabilitation or in some cases completely replace distressed public housing. To ensure that the housing remains permanently affordable, owners must agree to long-term rental assistance contracts and use restrictions that automatically renew as they expire. Combined with the physical improvements, these requirements ensure that the housing remains affordable and in good condition for decades to come.
Fundamental to the design of RAD, current and future residents are provided a robust set of rights and protections, including the right to return to the property when repairs are completed. Further, HUD requires that a public or non-profit entity must always maintain a controlling interest in the property, even in the rare and unanticipated event of foreclosure, thus ensuring the long-term public stewardship of the properties.
In Fiscal Year 2017, HUD is requesting that Congress eliminate the current 185,000 unit-cap on public housing units that can convert without additional HUD subsidy. PHAs have already applied and received initial awards up to this cap and a waiting list has now formed. Eliminating the cap will allow every PHA that wishes to participate the opportunity to leverage capital, as this report has demonstrated is possible. The report also highlighted that some public housing properties with more serious capital needs will not be able to be sufficiently improved without additional subsidy, which is why HUD is also proposing to provide $50 million to help local public housing agencies finance the deeper recapitalization of tens of thousands of units of public housing.
Phase II of HUD's evaluation will focus on how successful RAD is at improving the physical and financial conditions of federally assisted properties and how tenants have been impacted. The report will also update findings from the interim report as more data becomes available.

The announcement was made by HUD Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary Harriet Tregoning following a meeting with members of Governor John Bel Edward's Restore Louisiana Task Force.
The funding is provided through a special recovery fund established under the HUD's Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program. This Declared Disaster Recovery Fund will provide $11 million to Baton Rouge/East Baton Rouge Parish and $1.9 million Lafayette/Lafayette Parish, which are eligible since they are entitlement communities under the CDBG program.
""We've got to roll up our sleeves to support recovery in any way we can,"" said Tregoning. ""HUD will continue to work very closely with our state and local partners to plan and execute a long-term strategy to help homeowners get back in their homes, to rebuild critical infrastructure and to help local businesses open their doors again.""
While there have been 26 major presidentially declared disasters this year, the most significant of these events was the flooding in Louisiana, with significant damage occurring in areas around Baton Rouge and Lafayette. This award is a small but targeted source of funding to meet emergency community development needs while the status of any larger supplemental appropriation gets resolved.
The consolidated governments of Baton Rouge/East Baton Rouge Parish and Lafayette/Lafayette Parish can use the funding announced today to:
Provide support for persons and families experiencing homelessness; Repair damaged infrastructure; Rehabilitate damaged homes; and Restore rental properties and businesses.
• Provide support for persons and families experiencing homelessness;

09/27/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-143.cfm,HUD Awards More Than $14 Million to Help Low-Income Public Housing Residents Secure Higher Paying Jobs,"WASHINGTON - In an effort to help low-income public housing residents secure higher paying jobs and access to greater opportunity, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced a $14 million investment in six public housing authorities and their partners.
HUD's Jobs-Plus Initiative Program is a proven model that helps public housing residents find and keep higher paying jobs by connecting them with employment opportunities, educational advancement and financial literacy services. Read more about how these PHAs will put their grant funds to work.
Today in Dayton, Ohio, HUD Secretary Julián Castro announced the funding with Mayor Nan Whaley and the Greater Dayton Housing Authority, one of six grantees around the country. Speaking at Gillespie Park in the DeSoto Bass Courts Development of Dayton, Secretary Castro stressed housing and employment as a platform for upward mobility.
""HUD is continually looking for opportunities to collaborate with local communities to expand opportunity and help lift folks out of poverty,"" said Secretary Castro. ""Through Jobs-Plus, public housing authorities will be able to assist more Americans in their search for good jobs and higher wages that will put them on the path to success.""
HUD's Jobs-Plus Initiative Program brings employment and training services directly to public housing properties. These grants employ several principles of the Administration's Job Driven training checklist (https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/skills_report.pdf) to ensure that public housing residents are connected to evidence-based practices that are proven to work for job-seekers and employers. Since the program was launched by HUD in the Spring of 2015, it has now reached 24 communities throughout the nation.
The Jobs-Plus Initiative Program capitalizes on a successful demonstration (www.mdrc.org/publication/jobs-plus-promising-strategy) program that combined traditional employment, training and job placement services with a rent incentive and a place-based investment in building community support for work. The program model, which requires PHAs to partner with Department of Labor's American Jobs Centers, promotes initiatives to improve employment and earnings outcomes, a critical element of self-sufficiency for all families."
09/27/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-145.cfm,HUD Awards $3.3 Million in Grants to Support Research to Reduce Housing-Related Health Hazards,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced that it is making $3.3 million available in cooperative agreements to support research to develop and improve methods for the identification and control of key residential health hazards and to improve the implementation of policies that address these hazards. Key hazards to be addressed include pest infestation and mold which can trigger asthma and other illnesses, poor indoor air quality such as exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and other contaminants, and injury hazards. It is especially important to protect vulnerable populations, such as children, seniors, and people with chronic illnesses such as asthma, from exposure to these hazards. Read a complete project-by-project summary of the programs awarded grants today.
The following is a state-by-state breakdown of the funding:
HUD Secretary Julián Castro is focused on advancing policies that create opportunities for all Americans, including helping children and families secure quality housing by protecting them from the hazards of lead-based paint and other home health and safety hazards. Last month, HUD proposed a new rule to further protect young children living in federally assisted housing by lowering the Department's threshold of lead in the child's blood to match the standard used by CDC. HUD's proposed action level for lead in a young child's blood would be lowered from 20 µg/dL to 5 µg/dL, and continue to be aligned with CDC recommendations in the future. This important change to HUD's 17-year-old Lead Safe Housing Rule will allow for an earlier response when a child under six years old is exposed to lead-based paint hazards in their HUD-assisted homes.
HUD also announced The Lead-Safe Homes, Lead-Free Kids Toolkit, to help ensure HUD housing is lead-safe and launched the new Healthy Homes App (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gov.hud.healthyhomesbasics), which provides consumers with information about potentially serious health and safety problems in the home, and the steps they can take to protect themselves. In addition, HUD has published a proposed rule to prohibit the use of lit tobacco products in housing managed by public housing agencies, and continues to promote the voluntary adoption of these policies in other HUD-assisted housing. Read more (https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2015/11/17/2015-29346/instituting-smoke-free-public-housing).
""Keeping the homes of Americans safe and healthy is important to families and saves money,"" said Jon L. Gant, Director of the Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes. ""While we know that poor quality housing can contribute to injury and illness, these important grants provide the knowledge base needed to prevent harm and create healthy home environments for families and their children.""
HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes promotes local efforts to eliminate dangerous lead paint and other housing-related health and safety hazards from lower income homes, stimulate private sector investment in lead hazard control, support cutting-edge research on methods for assessing and controlling housing-related health and safety hazards, and educate the public about the dangers of hazards in the home.
The grants to states and local governments, institutions of higher education, and both for-profit and nonprofit organizations are being offered through HUD's Healthy Homes Technical Studies Grant Program."
09/27/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-146.cfm,FHA Proposes New Approval Process for Condominium Developments,"WASHINGTON - In response to changing conditions in the condominium market, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) today proposed new regulations governing the approval process for condominium developments. FHA proposes to reinstate single unit approvals in unapproved condominium developments and to require condo projects to recertify their approval status every three years rather than the current two-year requirement. Read FHA's proposed rule (https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2016-23258.pdf).
FHA is also seeking the public's comment on a proposal to create a range of thresholds required for FHA approval including the minimum owner-occupants in approved condo developments and limits on commercial/non-residential space. Ultimately, FHA will have the ability to specify new owner-occupancy, commercial/non-residential, and single-unit thresholds within the proposed ranges through a notice, handbook or mortgagee letter.
FHA's intent is to modify its condominium rules to ensure financial soundness and project viability, but in a manner that is more flexible where possible and responsive to the market. The proposed rule published today includes the following key provisions that will allow the agency to be more nimble in responding to future changes to the condo market:
Minimum Owner-Occupancy Requirements
FHA currently requires that approved condominium developments have a minimum of 50 percent of the units occupied by owners. While having too few owner-occupants can detract from the viability of a project, requiring too many can harm its marketability. Through this proposed rule, FHA is specifically inviting comment on this issue and is proposing to establish an allowable range between 25 and 75 percent. The range allows FHA to choose a specific percentage that is responsive to future market changes.
The Housing Opportunity through Modernization Act of 2016 (HOTMA) directed the Department, within 90 days of enactment, to issue guidance regarding the percentage of units within an approved condominium development that must be owner occupied. To satisfy the law's requirement, FHA will publish a mortgagee letter in the coming days establishing a new owner-occupancy requirement.
Commercial/Nonresidential Space Limits
FHA currently requires that the commercial/nonresidential space within an approved condominium development not exceed 50 percent of the project's total floor area, and anticipates maintaining this as a requirement in the near term. However, as the agency gains experience with this program, it may wish to modify this limitation and is therefore proposing to establish a range between 25 and 60 percent, which may be specified via subsequent notice, giving the agency flexibility to make any needed future adjustment within this range. Mixed-use developments are a way to integrate housing, land-use, economic and workforce development, as well as transportation and infrastructure development. While the agency acknowledges the benefits of mixed-use developments, in the near term, it believes that allowing greater than 50 percent commercial/nonresidential space may have a negative impact on the residential character of a condominium project.
Single-Unit Approvals
Under certain circumstances, FHA is proposing to insure mortgages for selected condominium units in developments that are not currently approved. An individual unit may be eligible for Single-Unit Approval if:
TheCondominium Project is not on the list of FHA-approved Condominium Projects, or the unit is not in a project that has been subject to adverse determination for significant issues that affect the viability of the project; The individual unit is located in a completed project that has not yet been approved; The unit is not a manufactured housing condominium project or located in a two-to-four-unit project; The condominium unit is not a manufactured home and is in a project that has at least five dwelling units; and The unit is in a project in which the amount of Single-Unit Approvals is limited to a maximum of 20 percent of the total number of units in the project, which may be reduced to as low as zero percent via subsequent notice.
• TheCondominium Project is not on the list of FHA-approved Condominium Projects, or the unit is not in a project that has been subject to adverse determination for significant issues that affect the viability of the project;
• The individual unit is located in a completed project that has not yet been approved;
• The unit is not a manufactured housing condominium project or located in a two-to-four-unit project;
• The condominium unit is not a manufactured home and is in a project that has at least five dwelling units; and
• The unit is in a project in which the amount of Single-Unit Approvals is limited to a maximum of 20 percent of the total number of units in the project, which may be reduced to as low as zero percent via subsequent notice.
Condominium Project Approval Eligibility
Under this proposed rule, FHA and participating lenders will not approve proposed or under construction projects; however, condominium projects may be approved in legal phases or upon completion. Condominium projects approved under this rule would be those where the work on the project or legal phase, including buildings and infrastructure of the project or legal phase, is fully complete.
Lender Review and Approval Authority
The rule would codify requirements for Direct Endorsement lenders to meet in order to be approved for the Direct Endorsement Lender Review and Approval Process (DELRAP) authority for condominiums. FHA is proposing that in order to be granted DELRAP authority, a lender must be unconditionally approved for the Direct Endorsement program and meet the following conditions:
Have staff with at least one-year experience in underwriting mortgages on condominiums and/or condominium project approval; Have originated not less than 10 condominium loans in HUD-approved projects; Have an acceptable quality control plan that includes specific provisions related to DELRAP; and Ensure that only staff members with the required experience participate in condominium project approval.
• Have staff with at least one-year experience in underwriting mortgages on condominiums and/or condominium project approval;
• Have originated not less than 10 condominium loans in HUD-approved projects;
• Have an acceptable quality control plan that includes specific provisions related to DELRAP; and
• Ensure that only staff members with the required experience participate in condominium project approval.
Under this proposed rule, lenders could be granted conditional DELRAP authority, provided they submit all recommended Condominium Project approvals and denials for FHA review, and may only proceed upon notification of FHA agreement with the recommendation. Once the mortgagee has completed at least five DELRAP reviews to FHA's satisfaction, the mortgagee will be granted unconditional DELRAP authority and may approve condominium projects in accordance with HUD's requirements.

09/29/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-147.cfm,HUD Charges South Dakota Landlord with Discriminating Against Woman and Her Daughter,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today it is charging a Rapid City, South Dakota, landlord with housing discrimination after she refused to rent an apartment to a woman and her daughter. According to HUD's charge, the landlord allegedly denied housing to the family stating, ""I decided to go with a bachelor. In the past, I have always rented to bachelors, that has worked best."" Read HUD's charge.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from denying or limiting housing to people based on sex or because they have children.
""Refusing to rent to women and families with children not only violates the law, it deprives them of scarce housing that meets their needs,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Landlords and property owners have an obligation to give every applicant a fair shot and HUD is committed to ensuring that they meet that obligation.""
HUD filed the charge on behalf of a single woman and her 17-year-old daughter who sought to rent a one-bedroom apartment in Rapid City. When the mother inquired about the unit after seeing an advertisement on Craigslist, she mentioned to the landlord that the apartment's location was ideal because of its proximity to her daughter's school. After submitting all required information as part of the application process, the woman received an email denial from the landlord stating her preference to rent to a bachelor.
The landlord eventually rented the unit to a single male who had no children.
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he or she may award damages to the complainants for their loss as a result of the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties in order to vindicate the public interest. If the case is heard in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages to the complainant.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY).

09/29/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-148.cfm,"HUD Charges Washington State Property Owners, Developer with Discriminating Against Residents with Disabilities","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today it is charging the owners and developers of Ashlynn Estates, a 27-unit complex in Ellensburg, Washington, with housing discrimination for designing and constructing housing units that fail to meet the accessibility requirements of the Fair Housing Act. Read HUD's charge.
The Fair Housing Act requires that multifamily housing built after March1991 contain accessible features for people with disabilities. Requirements include accessible common areas, bathrooms and kitchens, as well as wider doors and environmental controls that can be reached by residents who use wheelchairs. The failure to include these features violates the Fair Housing Act and makes the property difficult or impossible to use by people with disabilities.
""For more than 25 years, owners and developers have known their legal responsibility under the Fair Housing Act to design housing that is accessible to people with disabilities,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Constructing units that are not accessible reduces the availability of this critically needed housing and puts owners and developers at risk for paying for costly retrofitting on top of damages and other penalties.""
HUD's charge is the result of a complaint that was filed by Northwest Fair Housing Alliance, a non-profit organization located in Spokane. The charge alleges that the owners and developer of the complex, Riexinger Enterprises, doing business as Crossroads Construction, failed to design and construct the property in an accessible manner.
Specifically, HUD alleges that the buildings' bathroom and closet doors that are not wide enough for wheelchair access; there is insufficient floor space at bathroom fixtures; and there are no accessible entrances, parking spaces or accessible curbs or ramps.
The charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he or she may award damages to the complainant for its loss as a result of the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties in order to vindicate the public interest. If the case is heard in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages to the complainant.
In FY 2015, disability was the most common basis of complaints filed with HUD and its partner agencies, being cited as a basis for 4,548 complaints, or nearly 55 percent of the overall total.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY).

These grants willaddress challenges justice-involved individuals face when trying to find work and a place to call home. Read below a complete project-by-project summary of the programs awarded funding today.
The following is a state-by-state breakdown of the funding:
Funded through HUD's Juvenile Reentry Assistance Program (JRAP), HUD and DOJ are teaming up to help Americans who've paid their debt to society rehabilitate and reintegrate back into their communities.JRAP awarded the funding to PHAs who have a partnership with a nonprofit legal service organization with experience providing legal services to juveniles. In April, HUD and DOJ awarded $1.75 million to PHAs and their partners to help justice-involved individuals find jobs and housing.
This program specifically excludes makers of meth on public housing property, sex offenders on a lifetime registry or those convicted of domestic violence.
""It's in everyone's interest when youth who have paid their debt to society can re-enter their communities with job skills and greater access to opportunity,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""These grants go to the heart of that challenge by helping more youth reach their full potential.""
Having a juvenile or a criminal record can severely limit a person's ability to seek higher education, find good employment, or secure affordable housing. Today, there are nearly 55,000 individuals under age 21 in juvenile justice facilities. These consequences create unnecessary barriers to economic opportunity and productivity, and President Obama and members of his Cabinet continue to take impactful steps to ensure those exiting the justice system become productive, law-abiding citizens
To help alleviate collateral consequences associated with a juvenile or criminal record, JRAP will assist youth up to age 24 residing in public housing, or who would be residing in public housing but for their record, with:
Expunging, Sealing, and/or Correcting Juvenile or Adult Records; as permitted by State law, Assisting targeted youth in mitigating/preventing collateral consequences such as, reinstating revoked or suspended drivers' licenses; Counseling regarding legal rights and obligations in searching for employment; Providing guidance for readmission to school; Creating or modifying child support orders and other family law services, and more.

09/30/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-150.cfm,HUD Awards $38 Million to Fight Discrimination,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is awarding $38 million under its Fair Housing Initiatives Program (FHIP) to confront discriminatory housing practices. HUD's grants will support some 155 national and local fair housing organizations working to confront violations of the nation's landmark Fair Housing Act (see grantee list below and read individual summaries of the work of these organizations).
This year, HUD provided competitive funding under three notices to organizations that support a wide range of fair housing enforcement, education and outreach activities. These grants allow the groups to provide fair housing enforcement through testing in the rental and sales markets, to file fair housing complaints to HUD, and to conduct investigations. Finally, the education and outreach activities these organizations conduct also help to educate the public, housing providers and local governments about their rights and responsibilities under the Fair Housing Act.
""Every person should have a fair chance to live in a community of opportunity, free from discrimination,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""HUD remains deeply committed to fighting housing discrimination so folks have an equal shot at achieving the American Dream.Working closely with our fair housing partners on the ground, the investments we make today are a strong step forward to put an end to housing discrimination.""
FHIP grants are provided under three categories:
Private Enforcement Initiative grants (PEI) - These awards help nonprofit fair housing enforcement organizations carry out investigations and other enforcement activities to prevent or eliminate discriminatory housing practices. This year's PEI funds awarded a total of $30,350,000. Of this amount, $29,375,000 was awarded to fiscal year 2014, 2015 and 2016 Multi-Year awardees, while the remaining funding was reserved for fiscal year 2016 Lending Component awardees. Education and Outreach Initiative grants (EOI) - HUD awards these grants to groups that educate the public and housing providers about their rights and responsibilities under federal law or state and local fair housing laws that are substantially equivalent to the Fair Housing Act. The EOI funding totaled $7,450,000 for these activities. Fair Housing Organizations Initiative grants (FHOI) - HUD awards these grants to help build the capacity and effectiveness of non-profit fair housing organizations to continue and enhance enforcement of the Fair Housing Act. $500,000 was awarded in this category.

09/30/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-151.cfm,HUD Charges Manhattan Condo Owner with Discriminating Against Resident with Disabilities,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today it is charging a Manhattan property owner with violating the Fair Housing Act by discriminating against a resident with disabilities who required the use of an assistance animal. Read HUD's charge.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from denying or limiting housing to persons with disabilities, or from refusing to make reasonable accommodations in policies or practices for persons with disabilities. This includes waiving ""no pet"" policies for assistance or service animals.
""Anytime a housing provider refuses a person with disabilities a necessary accommodation, it is effectively denying him or her the opportunity to use and enjoy his or her home,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""In a nation where one out of every five people has a disability, this type of discrimination is unacceptable, and HUD will continue to address such discrimination when it occurs.""
The charge was filed on behalf of a man with a disability who sought a reasonable accommodation from 111 East 88th Partners, a business partnership that owns his Manhattan apartment. Specifically, HUD alleges that the partnership failed to grant his request to keep an emotional support animal, citing a prohibition against pets in his lease.
HUD claims that in response to the man's request for the reasonable accommodation, the partnership requested extensive and intrusive medical records and data. The partnership also reserved the right to subject the man to a medical examination and to question him, his physician, and his therapist under oath.
HUD's charge alleges that the request for such extensive medical information, after the resident had already provided medical documentation attesting to his disabilities and need for the support animal, interfered with his housing rights, a violation of the Fair Housing Act.
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he or she may award damages to the complainant for his loss as a result of the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties in order to vindicate the public interest. If the case is heard in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages to the complainant.
Disability is the most common basis of complaint filed with HUD and its partner agencies. Last year alone, HUD considered more than 4,500 disability-related complaints or nearly 55 percent of all fair housing complaints.

09/30/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-152.cfm,HUD Charges Massachusetts Landlords with Discriminating Against Families with Children,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today it is charging the owner of an apartment in Easthampton, Massachusetts with housing discrimination for refusing to rent an apartment to a couple with children because the unit was located on the third floor. Read HUD's charge.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from denying or limiting housing to families with children.
""Refusing to rent to families with children is against the law,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will continue to take enforcement action whenever the rights of families are violated.""
The charge was brought on behalf of a couple who allegedly were denied the opportunity to rent an apartment because they have a 3-year-old son. The couple was also expecting their second child when they were searching for an apartment. As part of their search the couple responded to a Craigslist ad that had been placed by the owner of the Easthampton property.
HUD alleges that when the owner learned the couple had a young child, he told them that the apartment was on the third floor and that he would never rent to them, asking if they knew ""what could happen to a child?"" HUD's charge further alleges that the manager then told the couple that he was relaying the information ""as would a father to a daughter.""
Prior to filing their complaint with HUD, the couple informed the Massachusetts Fair Housing Center (MFHC), a non-profit organization in Holyoke, Massachusetts, of their experience. A MFHC fair housing tester contacted the owner to inquire about renting an apartment for his family, which included a child, and allegedly the owner stated that he would not rent the unit to the tester because of the child.
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he or she may award damages to the complainants for their loss as a result of the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties in order to vindicate the public interest. If the case is heard in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages to the complainant.

The Conference is intended to renew commitment to sustainable urban development, address poverty and identify and address emerging global challenges.
In preparation for the Conference, HUD today also released The U.S. 20/20 Habitat III Report (https://www.huduser.gov/portal/publications/US-2020-Habitat-III-report.html). The report outlines the agency's work since the previous Habitat II conference 20 years ago, and reflects on the critical themes that will define the U.S. Habitat agenda for the next 20 years. The report focuses on three themes: promoting upward mobility for underserved Americans, expanding employment and educational resources and investing in community institutions. It is the result of nearly two years of significant consultations with federal, state and local partners whose diverse views were captured in the final report.
""In this 'Century of Cities,' there is more demand than ever to expand opportunity in urban communities around the world,"" said Secretary Castro. ""It is an honor to lead the U.S. delegation in Quito as we work with global partners to set a path forward for prosperity, growth and equal opportunity.""
Secretary Castro serves as the co-chair of the U.S. Habitat III National Committee along with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry. In May at the United Nations in New York, Secretary Castro convened hearings with mayors from around the world to offer suggestions for the UN Habitat III negotiations. The hearings marked the first time mayors and local governments had the opportunity to directly influence UN negotiations. Read Secretary Castro's opening remarks at the UN on HUD's website.
The UN convened the first Habitat conference in 1976 in Vancouver, sparking an international dialogue on urban issues. Twenty years later, at Habitat II in Istanbul, Turkey, world leaders adopted the Habitat Agenda, a global action plan aimed at providing adequate shelter for all. The Habitat III Conference is intended to reinvigorate the global commitment to sustainable urbanization. At Habitat III, participants will develop a ""New Urban Agenda,"" an action-oriented outcome document that addresses 21st Century challenges and harnesses the tremendous potential of cities to promote sustainable development.

10/04/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-154.cfm,HUD Launches Utility Benchmarking in an Effort to Increase Energy and Water Efficiency and Save Costs,"WASHINGTON - As outlined in President Obama's Climate Action Plan, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today proposed utility benchmarking of water and energy in its portfolio of public and assisted, as well as newly-insured, multifamily housing. This new 'utility benchmarking' initiative would apply to approximately 2.2 million units across several categories of HUD-assisted affordable housing: developments with Project Rental Assistance Contracts, multifamily properties with mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), and Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) with more than 250 public housing units.
Under this initiative, certain providers of HUD-assisted or public housing will begin collecting and reporting on their water and energy use. Benchmarking will guide these property owners and PHAs to make informed decisions, reduce operating costs and improve building performance over time.
Read HUD's notice to owners of Multifamily properties (https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/10/04/2016-23979/60-day-notice-of-proposed-information-collection-energy-benchmarking).

HUD believes that collecting and reporting these data will lead to investments that: improve resident comfort, reduce tenant turnover, stabilize operating costs, reduce taxpayer burden, preserve affordable housing, ensure disaster resilience; and mitigate climate change.
""Every homeowner wants to reduce energy costs to save money. But before property owners and managers can achieve measureable savings in the operating costs of their buildings, they need to understand just how much water and energy consumption is costing them,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""Today we propose a common sense practice that will lead to savings for building owners, housing authorities and taxpayers alike.""
HUD's proposal seeks to establish procedures for building owners to input utility and energy data into the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's free, web-based ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager® (https://www.energystar.gov/buildings/facility-owners-and-managers/existing-buildings/use-portfolio-manager). HUD, building owners, and residents have a shared interest in eliminating energy and water waste while stabilizing operating costs to ensure that taxpayer investments are viable for the long-term. However, HUD is currently unable to effectively analyze the energy and water use patterns, improvement potential, and investment needs of properties in the assisted and insured portfolios.
Several studies, including the Government Accountability Office (2008), have recommended that HUD work with property owners to establish the practice of utility benchmarking across its housing portfolios. Utility benchmarking involves tracking the utility consumption of a development on an on-going basis, calculating the energy and water efficiency of the development, and comparing its efficiency to similar developments.
For example, a Portfolio Manager benchmarking score of 50 indicates a property's energy or water use is 'average' compared to similar buildings. A score higher than 50 shows that the property is more efficient than its peers and lower scores indicates the property is less efficient as compared to similar properties. A performance score of 75 qualifies the building for an ENERGY STAR rating for existing buildings. Accordingly, utility benchmarking is a valuable tool in the strategic management of building portfolios over time. That is why a growing number of municipal and state governments across the country are already instituting successful utility benchmarking in commercial and larger residential properties to allow government policymakers, funding providers, and building owners to make data-driven decisions.
HUD is dedicating resources to help owners collect, track, and analyze energy data. This includes building a website (https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/utility-benchmarking/) with tools, case studies, and links to federal resources. This assistance builds on experience with the Better Buildings Challenge (BBC), a voluntary leadership initiative that asks building owners, developers, and managers to make a portfolio-wide commitment to energy efficiency and provide their energy savings data and strategies as models for others to follow.
Preservation of Affordable Housing (POAH), a BBC partner and Multifamily owner, has been benchmarking its portfolio and collecting and analyzing utility data from more than 1,500 utility accounts since 2010, including at Colony Plaza in Excelsior Springs, Missouri. Through benchmarking, POAH identified this building for upgrades that improved efficiency and helped POAH move closer to its goals of reducing energy and water consumption across its portfolio by 20 percent by 2020. Additionally, the building reduced operating expenses by more than $20,000 each year. Read more (https://betterbuildingssolutioncenter.energy.gov/showcase-projects/colony-plaza-apartments)."

Provided through HUD's Community Development Block Grant - Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) Program, these recovery funds will assist the most impacted communities that experienced the most serious damage to their housing stock.
President Obama signed the Continuing Resolution into law on September 29, 2016. This stopgap spending measure directed HUD to allocate $500 million ""in the most impacted and distressed areas"" that experienced presidentially declared disasters in 2016, but prior to September 29th. As a result of this limitation, HUD considered all 33 major disasters that occurred within this period of time. Areas effected by Hurricane Matthew are not eligible as for these funds as disaster declarations for Matthew occurred after the Continuing Resolution became law.
""Immediately after President Obama signed this spending bill into law, my team began identifying the strongest cases to receive disaster recovery funds,"" said Secretary Castro. ""These three states - Louisiana, Texas and West Virginia - experienced intense and destructive flooding causing great damage to residents' homes and draining state resources. Today, we make a critically needed investment to help these communities recover and help families rebuild their homes.""
HUD awarded the following disaster recovery funds based on each state's proportional share of serious unmet housing needs:
For this allocation, HUD allocates CDBG-Disaster Recovery funds based on the best available data from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to identify the areas of greatest level of 'unmet housing need.' In the hardest-hit counties of Louisiana (6 counties), Texas (3 counties), and West Virginia (2 counties), more than 102,000 households experienced some level of damage to their homes including more than 41,000 families who saw the most serious level of damage or destruction and unmet needs.
HUD will shortly publish a notice in the Federal Register which will define the criteria for the use of these funds. CDBG-Disaster Recovery grants can support a wide variety of activities including housing redevelopment, business assistance and infrastructure repair."

BUILDING PERMITS
Privately owned housing units authorized by building permits in September were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,225,000. This is 6.3 percent (±1.9%) above the revised August rate of 1,152,000, but is 8.5 percent (±2.4%) above the September 2015 estimate of 1,129,000. Single-family authorizations in September were at a rate of 739,000; this is 0.4 percent (±1.6%) above the revised August figure of 736,000. Authorizations of units in buildings with five units or more were at a rate of 449,000 in September.
HOUSING STARTS
Privately owned housing starts in September were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,047,000. This is 9.0 percent (±9.2%)* below the revised August estimate of 1,150,000, but is 11.9 percent (±11.9%)* below the September 2015 rate of 1,189,000. Single-family housing starts in September were at a rate of 783,000; this is 8.1 percent (±7.4%)* above the revised August figure of 724,000. The September rate for units in buildings with five units or more was 250,000.

The September rate for units in buildings with five units or more was 250,000.
EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take two months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, 4 months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2%) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90-percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised about three percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found on our web site listed above.
* 90% confidence interval includes zero. The Census Bureau does not have sufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero.

10/21/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-157.cfm,HUD Reaches $65 Million Agreement with Puerto Rico Public Housing Administration to Improve Accessibility for Disabled Residents,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced today a $65 million agreement with the Puerto Rico Public Housing Administration to address longstanding accessibility issues affecting housing for residents with disabilities. Read HUD's Voluntary Compliance Agreement.
Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance. The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to discriminate in the rental or sale of housing or to impose different terms and conditions based on disability.
By entering into the agreement, the Puerto Rico housing administration is taking the critical and necessary actions needed to fully comply with its statutory obligations under Section 504, the Americans with Disability Act, the Fair Housing Act, and the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968.
""We're pleased we could reach this historic agreement with the Puerto Rico Housing Administration to significantly increase the number of accessible units for people with disabilities. I particularly commend the efforts of our colleagues at the Office of Public and Indian Housing for partnering with the Office of Fair Housing to make this agreement possible,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""The Puerto Rico Housing Administration has been trying for some time to ensure that public housing residents on the island are afforded the accessibility they need to fully use and enjoy their homes.""
The Puerto Rico Public Housing Administration owns, operates or controls 53,779 units in 52 municipalities throughout Puerto Rico. The agreement commits $65 million of Puerto Rico Public Housing Administration funds for retrofitting 2,560 housing units to make them accessible by December 31, 2021. The five-year agreement also includes flexibility for the housing administration to meet that requirement through a combination of actions, including:
Retrofit up to 1,489 units in housing projects that were built, modernized and/or rehabilitated after July 11, 1988; Produce up to 1,209 units in 184 housing projects which were built, modernized and/or rehabilitated before July 11, 1988, and/or; Create up to 1,108 new replacements or modernized units in 25 project sites that are currently undergoing or which will undergo modernizations in the future. Setting aside $3.6 millioneach year for five years to cover activities related to this agreement.
• Retrofit up to 1,489 units in housing projects that were built, modernized and/or rehabilitated after July 11, 1988;
• Produce up to 1,209 units in 184 housing projects which were built, modernized and/or rehabilitated before July 11, 1988, and/or;
• Create up to 1,108 new replacements or modernized units in 25 project sites that are currently undergoing or which will undergo modernizations in the future.
• Setting aside $3.6 millioneach year for five years to cover activities related to this agreement.
Additionally, the agreement requires the housing administration to produce 1,024 sensory-accessible dwelling units by December 31, 2017. The housing administration will also ensure that existing administrative offices and non-housing programs are accessible to residents with disabilities; update its assessment of the special needs of families with disabilities; document all reasonable accommodation requests; and maintain a fair housing education program for all appropriate employees, including contractors and private management agents.
The agreement grants an additional five-year period for the housing administration to provide successful proof of full compliance with each condition, and marks the first time an agreement to help the Puerto Rico housing administration achieve its goal of meeting the needs of residents with disabilities comes with funding.
The agreement is the culmination of many years of work between HUD and housing administration to address numerous systemic and longstanding accessibility issues. In January 2003, HUD conducted an initial review of the housing administration's compliance with Section 504 and the ADA, and found accessibility-related deficiencies in programs, services and policies affecting people with disabilities, as well as structural inaccessibility in housing units and common areas.
In September 2003, HUD and the Puerto Rico housing administration entered into a seven-year Voluntary Compliance Agreement to address the accessibility issues identified. That agreement expired on August 31, 2010, without the housing administration reaching full compliance. On December 27, 2011, HUD granted a four-year extension, but the housing administration's efforts continued to face serious challenges."
10/24/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-159.cfm,HUD Expands Housing Protections for Survivors of Violence,"WASHINGTON - When a home is a place of violence, residents are vulnerable to losing their housing through eviction, coercion, or abuse. Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development finalized a new rule to protect the housing of survivors of domestic and dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. Read HUD's final rule.
In an address to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence in Chandler, Arizona, HUD Secretary Julián Castro emphasized the importance of the rule in building a broad set of housing protections into all of HUD's key programs.
""Nobody should have to choose between an unsafe home and no home at all,"" said Secretary Castro. ""Today we take a necessary step toward ensuring domestic violence survivors are protected from being twice victimized when it comes to finding and keeping a home they can feel safe in.""
HUD's rule includes:
Continuation of the core protections - The rule codifies the core protection across HUD's covered programs ensuring survivors are not denied assistance as an applicant, or evicted or have assistance terminated due to having been a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking, or for being affiliated with a victim. Emergency transfers - One of the key elements of VAWA's housing protections are emergency transfers which allows for survivors to move to another safe and available unit if they fear for their life and safety. VAWA required HUD to adopt a model emergency transfer plan for housing providers and to explain how housing providers must address their tenants' requests for emergency transfers. HUD's model emergency transfer plan: allows a survivor to self-certify their need for an emergency transfer, ensuring documentation is not a barrier to protecting their immediate safety; allows the survivor to determine what is a safe unit for purposes of the transfer, ensuring that the survivor has control over their own safety planning; requires housing providers to allow for a resident to move immediately if there is another safe and available unit that does not require the survivor to undergo an application process as a new tenant, ensuring quicker access to safe housing; requires housing providers to explain the efforts they will take when there is not a safe and available unit available for an emergency transfer and encourages housing provides to partner with victim services and advocates t and other housing providers to assist a survivor; and, requires housing providers to document requests for emergency transfers, including the outcome of the request, and to report annually to HUD. Protections against the adverse effects of abuse - Domestic violence can often have negative economic and criminal consequences on a survivor. The perpetrator may take out credit cards in a survivor's name, ruining their credit history, or causing damage to survivor's property causing eviction and poor rental history. The perpetrator may force a survivor to participate in criminal activity or a survivor may be arrested as part of policies that require arresting of both parties in a domestic disturbance. The final rule ensures that covered housing providers do not deny tenancy or occupancy rights based solely on these adverse factors that are a direct result of being a survivor. Low-barrier certification process - The final rule makes it clear that under most circumstances, a survivor need only to self-certify in order to exercise their rights under VAWA, ensuring third party documentation does not cause a barrier in a survivor expressing their rights and receiving the protections needed to keep themselves safe.

Background
On March 7, 2013, President Obama signed The Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 (VAWA 2013) into law. The law significantly expanded the housing protections to survivors of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking, across HUD's core housing and homelessness programs. HUD quickly modified its administrative practices to incorporate the core protections, but the more expansive protections required a change in regulation. The final rule announced today satisfies this requirement.
Last month, HUD also issued new guidance to assist local governments in the development and implementation of nuisance and crime-free ordinances to make certain they don't violate victims' rights under the Fair Housing Act. These nuisance and crime-free ordinances can result in housing discrimination by requiring or encouraging evictions for use of emergency services, including 911 calls. Too often, these ordinances cause survivors of domestic violence to have to choose between keeping their home or protecting their own life."
10/25/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-160.cfm,HUD Releases 3-Year Study of Strategies to End Family Homelessness,"WASHINGTON - When a family with children seeks emergency shelter, there are a number of interventions to address their homelessness. Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) released the results of an exhaustive study to identify the most efficient and cost-effective ways to house and serve these families. After tracking more than 2,200 families over a three-year period, HUD found that a long-term subsidy, typically a Housing Choice Voucher, led to far better outcomes for reducing family homelessness and improving family well-being.
HUD's Family Options Study: Three-year Impacts of Housing and Services Interventions for Homeless Families (https://www.huduser.gov/portal/family_options_study.html) discovered that 37 months after enrolling into the study and being randomly assigned to one of four interventions, the families offered a long-term subsidy experienced significant reductions in subsequent homelessness; housing and school mobility; adult psychological distress; intimate partner violence; and food insecurity. Families offered community-based rapid re-housing or project-based transitional housing had similar outcomes to families offered 'usual care' (defined below), but community-based rapid rehousing programs proved to be significantly less expensive than the project-based transitional housing and emergency shelter options in the crisis response system.
""The evidence from this study indicates that having access to deep long-term housing subsidies produces substantial benefits for families.,"" said Kathy O'Regan, HUD's Assistant Secretary of Policy Development and Research. ""While we continue to seek more housing subsidies to help families experiencing homelessness, we must also recognize that rapid rehousing is proving to be the most cost-effective tool that we have available within the crisis response system.""
About the Report
HUD launched the Family Options Study in 2008 to test which interventions work best for families with children that are experiencing homelessness. Abt Associates, in collaboration with Vanderbilt University, designed a rigorous random assignment study to measure the benefits and costs associated with four responses to family homelessness—long-term housing subsidy, community-based rapid rehousing, project based transitional housing, and usual care, which left families to find their way out of shelter without priority access to a program that would provide them with a place to live. Over a 37-month period (between September of 2010 and October of 2013), a total of 2,282 homeless families (including 5,397 children) enrolled into the study from emergency shelters in 12 communities nationwide:
• Alameda County, California
• Atlanta
• Baltimore
• Boston
• New Haven and Bridgeport regions, Connecticut
• Denver
• Honolulu
• Kansas City, Missouri
• Louisville, Kentucky
• Minneapolis
• Phoenix
• Salt Lake City
After spending at least seven days in an emergency shelter, these families were randomly assigned to one of four interventions:
• Long-term housing subsidy, usually a Housing Choice Voucher, which could include help finding housing but no other supportive services.
• Community-based rapid re-housing, which provides temporary rental assistance, potentially renewable for up to 18 months, paired with limited, housing-focused services to help families find and rent conventional, private-market housing.
• Project-based transitional housing, which provides temporary housing for up to 24 months in agency-controlled buildings or apartment units paired with intensive supportive services.
• Usual care, which is defined as any housing or services that a family accesses in the absence of immediate referral to the other interventions. Typically, this includes at least some additional stay in the emergency shelter from which families were enrolled.
Random assignment provided families with a direct referral to one of four different interventions—but families were not required to accept this referral and were free to pursue alternate arrangements. HUD measured outcomes for families in five key areas: housing stability, family preservation, adult well-being, child well-being, and self-sufficiency. HUD compared the outcomes of families assigned to each of the four interventions.
Major Findings: 37 Months Later
Families offered a long-term subsidy experienced significantly less homelessness and housing instability than families offered any of the other interventions.
• Families offered a long-term subsidy experienced significantly less homelessness and housing instability than families offered any of the other interventions.
Families offered a long-term subsidy continued to demonstrate significantly improved non-housing outcomes compared to families offered usual care, including adult well-being (reductions in psychological distress, intimate partner violence), child well-being (reductions in school mobility, behavior problems and sleep problems, and more pro-social behavior), as well as increased food security and decreased economic stress.
• Families offered a long-term subsidy continued to demonstrate significantly improved non-housing outcomes compared to families offered usual care, including adult well-being (reductions in psychological distress, intimate partner violence), child well-being (reductions in school mobility, behavior problems and sleep problems, and more pro-social behavior), as well as increased food security and decreased economic stress.
Families randomly assigned to community-based rapid re-housing experienced similar outcomes to those families who were assigned to usual care, achieving no statistically significant reductions in subsequent emergency shelter use or housing mobility, but at significantly less cost than usual care.
• Families randomly assigned to community-based rapid re-housing experienced similar outcomes to those families who were assigned to usual care, achieving no statistically significant reductions in subsequent emergency shelter use or housing mobility, but at significantly less cost than usual care.
Families randomly assigned to project-based transitional housing with intensive support services experienced reductions in emergency shelter use relative to families assigned to usual care, but achieved no better non-housing outcomes.
• Families randomly assigned to project-based transitional housing with intensive support services experienced reductions in emergency shelter use relative to families assigned to usual care, but achieved no better non-housing outcomes.
Families offered a subsidy or community-based rapid re-housing spent significantly less time in transitional housing than families assigned to usual care. Families assigned to usual care used roughly $41,000 in housing and services over the full 37-month period of study. Families assigned to the community-based rapid re-housing intervention incurred the lowest costs, using $4,000 less in housing and services than families assigned to usual care. Providing priority access to housing subsidies cost nearly $4,000 more over the three-year study period than families assigned to usual care, but that additional cost yielded substantial benefits. Costs of the housing and services provided to families assigned to project-based transitional housing exceeded the costs for families assigned to community-based rapid re-housing or usual care, but were slightly cheaper than the costs incurred by families offered a subsidy. Emergency shelter programs had the highest average per-family monthly costs of approximately $4,800, compared to transitional housing at $2,700/month, a voucher at $1,172/month, and rapid re-housing at $880/month.

The evidence documenting the high costs of transitional housing, coupled with the lack of demonstrated benefits to families, has led HUD to encourage local communities to review, and likely reduce, the number of transitional housing beds they support. Findings from HUD's Family Options Study will continue to guide the Department's effort to press state and local planners to target their limited resources to those strategies that demonstrate the best outcomes for families and their children.
Meanwhile, HUD's proposed Fiscal Year 2017 budget includes a request for $11 billion over the next ten years to enable HUD to rapidly rehouse nearly 550,000 families with children through targeted, evidence-based interventions. Read more.
HUD will host a briefing to present the findings of its Family Options Study at 2 p.m. ET on Tuesday, October 25th. This briefing will be webcast live, and will be available to access on HUD's website. Following this briefing, the briefing will be available on HUD's YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/user/HUDchannel)."
10/26/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-161.cfm,HUD and Census Bureau Report New Residential Sales in September,"WASHINGTON - Sales of new single-family houses in September 2016 were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 593,000, according to estimates released jointly today by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Census Bureau. This is 3.1 percent (±16.2%)* above the revised August rate of 575,000, but is 29.8 percent (±23.4%) above the September 2015 estimate of 457,000.
The median sales price of new houses sold in September 2016 was $313,500; the average sales price was $377,700. The seasonally adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of September was 235,000. This represents a supply of 4.8 months at the current sales rate.
New Residential Sales data for October 2016 will be released on Wednesday, November 23, 2016, at 10:00 A.M. EDT. Read more about new residential sales activity (www.census.gov/construction/nrs/index.html).
EXPLANATORY NOTES
These statistics are estimated from sample surveys. They are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated average relative standard errors of the preliminary data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2%) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90-percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. Changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show irregular movement. It takes 3 months to establish a trend for new houses sold. Preliminary new home sales figures are subject to revision due to the survey methodology and definitions used. The survey is primarily based on a sample of houses selected from building permits. Since a ""sale"" is defined as a deposit taken or sales agreement signed, this can occur prior to a permit being issued. An estimate of these prior sales is included in the sales figure. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimate of total sales is revised about 4 percent. Changes in sales price data reflect changes in the distribution of houses by region, size, etc., as well as changes in the prices of houses with identical characteristics. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found on our web site listed above.
* 90% confidence interval includes zero. The Census Bureau does not have sufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero."
10/26/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-162.cfm,FHA to Lower Owner-Occupancy Requirement for Certain Condominium Developments,"WASHINGTON - The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) today announced that, under certain circumstances, it will lower its required owner-occupancy standard for approved condominium developments effective immediately. FHA currently requires that approved condominium developments have a minimum of 50 percent of the units occupied by owners. However, the agency determined this requirement can be lowered to 35 percent for existing condo developments provided the project meets certain conditions. Read FHA's mortgagee letter.
The Housing Opportunity through Modernization Act of 2016 (HOTMA) directed the FHA to issue guidance regarding the percentage of units within an approved condominium development that must be owner-occupied. While having too few owner-occupants can detract from the viability of a project, requiring too many can harm its marketability. It is FHA's position that owner-occupants serve to stabilize the financial viability of the projects and are less likely to default on their obligations to homeowner associations than non-owner occupants.
For some condominium projects, the existing owner-occupancy requirement is necessary to maintain the stability of FHA's Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMIF). In certain instances, however, FHA believes that it would be possible to protect the Fund while allowing a lower percentage of owner-occupants. HUD's experience shows that higher reserves, a low percentage of association dues in arrears, and evidence of long-term financial stability allow for a lower owner-occupancy percentage without undue risk to the MMIF.
For existing condominium developments greater than 12 months old, FHA will lower the owner-occupancy requirement to as low as 35 percent under the following conditions:
Applications must be submitted for processing and review under the HUD Review and Approval Process (HRAP) option; Financial documents must provide for funding of replacement reserves for capital expenditures and deferred maintenance in an account representing at least 20 percent of the condo development's budget; No more than 10 percent of the total units can be in arrears (more than 60 days past due) on their condominium association fee payments; and Three years of acceptable financial documents must be provided.
• Applications must be submitted for processing and review under the HUD Review and Approval Process (HRAP) option;
• Financial documents must provide for funding of replacement reserves for capital expenditures and deferred maintenance in an account representing at least 20 percent of the condo development's budget;
• No more than 10 percent of the total units can be in arrears (more than 60 days past due) on their condominium association fee payments; and
• Three years of acceptable financial documents must be provided.
For condominium projects that are proposed, under construction (including existing projects less than 12 months old) or gut rehab conversions, FHA will maintain its current owner-occupancy percentage of 30 percent."
10/26/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-163.cfm,HUD Charges Ohio Housing Authority with Discriminating Against Family with Disabilities,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is charging the Trumbull Metropolitan Housing Authority in Warren, Ohio with violating the Fair Housing Act by denying the reasonable accommodation requests of a family that includes a father and daughter with severe disabilities. Read HUD's charge.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from denying or limiting housing to persons with disabilities, or from refusing to make reasonable accommodations in policies or practices for people with disabilities.
""When families are living with disabilities, landlords have a legal responsibility to grant reasonable accommodations,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will continue to confront this type of housing discrimination whenever it occurs.""
The case came to HUD's attention when the four-member family participating in the Housing Choice Voucher Program filed a complaint against the Trumbull Metropolitan Housing Authority after it denied their request to move from their two-bedroom apartment into a unit that was appropriate for their disability needs. The family submitted a request to occupy a home that had two additional rooms to separately accommodate the father's dialysis treatments and a daughter's disability.
According to the charge, though the housing authority initially approved the family's request it ultimately terminated their voucher assistance, and denied their request for new voucher program paperwork. The family then lived in separate locations while the father underwent treatments alone.
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he or she may award damages to the complainants for their loss as a result of the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties in order to vindicate the public interest. If the case is heard in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages to the complainants.
Disability is the most common basis of complaint filed with HUD and its partner agencies. Last year alone, HUD considered more than 4,500 disability-related complaints or nearly 55 percent of all fair housing complaints.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to www.hud.gov/fairhousing, or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, which can be accessed through Apple and Android devices."
10/26/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-164.cfm,HUD Announces Agreement with City of Flagstaff and Housing Authority to Resolve Discrimination Claims,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced today an agreement with the City of Flagstaff, Arizona, and the Flagstaff Housing Authority resolving allegations that they denied the reasonable accommodation requests of a resident with disabilities. Read the Voluntary Compliance Agreement.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from denying or limiting housing to persons with disabilities, or from refusing to make reasonable accommodations in policies or practices for persons with disabilities.
""To residents with disabilities, certain accommodations can mean the difference between just having a roof over their head or being able to fully enjoy their home,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""These types of settlements remind housing providers of their responsibilities under the Fair Housing Act and demonstrate HUD's commitment to ensuring that they meet those responsibilities.""
The case came to HUD's attention when a female resident filed a complaint alleging that the City of Flagstaff and the Flagstaff Housing Authority refused her request to be moved away from her neighbors, whose disruptive behavior agitated her medical disability. The woman alleged that even after she submitted a doctor's documentation supporting her contention that her medical condition made her highly sensitive to the disruptions, her requests to move were denied.
Under the agreement, the housing authority will pay the woman $5,000, allow her to transfer to another unit within 90 days, and provide training to staff on the Fair Housing Act, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Americans with Disabilities Act.
Disability is the most common basis of complaint filed with HUD and its partner agencies. Last year alone, HUD and its state and local partners investigated more than 4,500 disability-related complaints, or nearly 55 percent of all fair housing complaints.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY).

10/27/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-165.cfm,"HUD Proposes ""Resilience Standard"" to Protect Communities and Taxpayer-Funded Investments from Flooding","WASHINGTON - In the face of increased flooding risks and rising sea levels, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today proposed elevation standards for all HUD-supported properties. For the first time in nearly 40 years, HUD is proposing to establish higher elevation requirements for properties seeking HUD assistance or Federal Housing Administration (FHA) mortgage insurance. Read HUD's proposed rule (https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-10-28/pdf/2016-25521.pdf).
Specifically, HUD's proposed rule would require that properties deemed 'non-critical' to be elevated two-feet above the site's base flood elevation (https://www.fema.gov/base-flood) (also called 100-year floodplain), a term commonly used in floodplain management. Properties considered 'critical,' such as hospitals, nursing homes, and police/fire facilities, would be elevated to three feet above the base flood elevation or the 500-year floodplain, whichever is greater. Read more about HUD's proposed rule (https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/environmental-review/FFRMS).
""Our nation is faced with mounting and compelling evidence that future flooding events will be increasingly costly and frequent,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""If we're serious about protecting people and property from flooding, we have to think differently than we did 40 years ago. Today we begin the process of aligning our regulations with the evidence to make sure taxpayer dollars are invested in the most responsible and resilient manner possible.""
In addition to proposing higher vertical elevation standards for HUD-assisted and insured properties, the Department is also proposing to enlarge the commensurate horizontal floodplain area around the site for certain types of federally supported properties (see image).
The proposed rule would also revise HUD's Minimum Property Standards for single-family homes with mortgages insured by FHA and for public housing developments. HUD would require that the lowest floor in both newly constructed and substantially improved structures located within the 100-year floodplain be built at least two feet above the base flood elevation as determined by best available information, but would not consider the extent of horizontal flooding. Elevation standards for manufactured housing receiving mortgage insurance are not covered in this proposed rule.
Background
From 1959 to 2005, floods caused 4,586 deaths in the U.S. With climate change and associated sea-level rise, flooding risks have increased and are anticipated to continue increasing. The National Climate Assessment (May 2014) projects that extreme weather events, such as severe flooding, will persist throughout the 21st century causing significant damage to infrastructure, including buildings, roads, ports, industrial facilities, and even coastal military installations. Since 1980, flooding events in the U.S. resulted in more than $260 billion in damages. This year alone, the U.S. has experienced two ""once-in-a-thousand-year floods,"" several 500-year events with 38 Presidentially declared major disasters.
In April of 2013, the Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force announced that all Federally funded rebuilding projects related to Hurricane Sandy must meet a consistent flood risk reduction standard that takes into account risk from extreme weather events, sea level rise, and other impacts of climate change. In his Climate Action Plan (https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/image/president27sclimateactionplan.pdf), the President called on Federal agencies to scale this up nation-wide to ensure Federal investments are not wasted in the same structures after repeated flooding events."

11/04/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-167.cfm,HUD Approves Settlement Between East Chicago Housing Authority and Fair Housing Organization,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today an agreement between the East Chicago Housing Authority and a fair housing organization, resolving multiple complaints of housing discrimination.
The Sargent Shriver National Center on Poverty Law, on behalf of residents, alleged the East Chicago Housing Authority violated the Fair Housing Act, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act with respect to the relocation of residents at West Calumet Housing Complex due to soil surrounding the complex being contaminated with lead and arsenic. The Shriver Center's complaints alleged the housing authority engaged in discriminatory housing practices in its management of the relocation because residents were being moved into poor, segregated communities with similar or serious levels of environmental contaminations. The agreement resolves the complaints and serves as the foundation to ensure residents of the West Calumet Housing Complex are relocated in a coordinated manner to safe housing in areas of opportunity.
""Residents in the West Calumet housing complex are dealing with many decisions on the health and future well-being of their families, and this agreement will help ensure they have the necessary time and resources to make the best decision possible under these unprecedented circumstances,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""We commend the collaboration between the housing authority and local fair housing leaders to reach this fair housing agreement in a timely manner.""
Specifically, the Shriver Center claimed the housing authority made housing unavailable on the basis of race, familial status, and/or disability and discriminated against residents in the terms, conditions, privileges, or services and facilities. The Shriver Center claimed that when the housing authority made the decision to vacate and demolish the West Calumet Housing Complex after it determined that the lead and arsenic contaminated soil surrounding the complex posed imminent danger to its residents, it did not provide the time or resources for households to make decisions in the best interest of their health and safety. The Shriver Center also alleged that the East Chicago Housing Authority failed to offer higher rent subsidies if needed and other reasonable accommodations to households that included members with disabilities, in accordance with Section 504.
Under the terms of the agreement, the East Chicago Housing Authority will ensure it offers relocation benefits to all eligible residents of the West Calumet Public Housing Complex, including residents who moved out prior to the lead disclosure if they moved out due to health concerns or if they have children under the age of 6. These relocation benefits include a Housing Choice Voucher for residents and their families. In addition to relocation benefits and housing vouchers, the housing authority will waive the rent owed by residents residing at the West Calumet Housing Complex from July 22, 2016 through March 31, 2017 or the end of their tenancy. The housing authority will also reimburse any rent paid by tenants for November 2016.
The Voluntary Compliance Agreement also includes extended time for families to search for new housing that accepts their housing choice vouchers. If families have not located housing by March 31, 2017, they may transfer out of West Calumet housing complex on an emergency basis to other public housing units while they continue their search. Under the agreement, families will have through approximately July 1, 2017 to take their housing vouchers to a new location.
Other terms of the agreement include the full return of most security deposits; mobility and relocation counseling for households; enhanced mobility and relocation counseling for households with a member who has a disability and/or elevated blood lead levels; expedited assessments of proposed new units for households with residents with elevated blood lead levels, or those who currently have an impairment associated with lead poisoning; the creation of a housing mobility program to provide households with information about opportunity areas; higher rent subsidies to households as a need-based reasonable accommodation for people with disabilities and families with children with elevated blood lead levels; and on-site risk assessments to determine and report the existence, nature, severity, and location of lead-based paint hazards in any potential new units. Read the agreement for the complete list of terms.
HUD has also entered into a Technical Assistance Contract with Inland Fair Housing and Mediation Board to provide technical assistance to East Chicago Housing Authority to provide mobility counseling for the residents.
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin in programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance. The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to discriminate in the rental or sale of housing or to impose different terms and conditions based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, and disability. Section 504 and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability in programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance and by state and local government entities."

The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to discriminate against families with children, including denying or limiting housing to families because they have children under the age of 18, making discriminatory statements, and imposing rules or policies that discriminate against families with children.
""Families with children have the same rights as any other American,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""The enforcement actions we are taking today signal HUD's commitment to ensuring that housing providers meet their obligation to treat all applicants and residents the same.""
Georgia
HUD is charging Peachtree Court Homeowners Association, Inc., with denying a family's request to have play equipment for their children in their backyard. The family had requested permission to construct a playset but the request was denied. Subsequently, the family attached a slide to the rear deck of the home. When the Association learned about the slide, they sent the family a letter stating that the slide had to be removed. The Board of Directors also levied fines against the family for unauthorized improvements that totaled $2,300 and prevented the family from using some community amenities, including the community pool. Read the charge.
Louisiana
HUD is charging the owner of a three-unit rental property in New Orleans with violating the Fair Housing Act by discriminating against families with children. The case came to HUD's attention when the Greater New Orleans Fair Housing Action Center, a HUD Fair Housing Initiatives Program agency, filed a complaint after seeing a classified ad the owner placed on Craigslist. A fair housing tester posing as a married father with eight-month-old twins sent an email to the owner inquiring about the apartment. After a friend of the owner showed the tester the unit, the owner sent the tester an email allegedly stating, ""I'm not sure the combo with the two young babies and the vacation rental next door is the best fit…I have only gotten a few complaints from long-term tenants over the years, but I am concerned that with two young kids you could be complaining more than that and I don't want to get the wrong tenants in the house."" Read the charge.
New Hampshire
HUD is charging the owner of an apartment in West Keene, New Hampshire, with housing discrimination for allegedly refusing to rent the unit to families with children. The case came to HUD's attention when a married couple filed a complaint alleging that the owner denied them the opportunity to rent the apartment. The charge alleges that the couple first learned about the unit when they saw an ad for a ""huge"" apartment in West Keene. The wife contacted the owner to inquire about the unit, but when she told him that she was looking for an apartment for herself, her husband, and her children, the owner allegedly told her that ""he was not interested in renting to anyone with children,"" and that he ""just evicted a family with children because they were too loud."" The charge further alleges that a tester with New Hampshire Legal Assistance, another HUD Fair Housing Initiatives Program agency, also contacted the owner and was told that the previous tenants who were evicted had three ""messy"" children, and that he would like to rent the apartment to a husband and wife or a single person. The owner ultimately rented the apartment to two women who did not have children. Read the charge.
The charges will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, damages may be awarded to the complainants.

Meanwhile, HUD is announcing separate agreements with landlords in Nevada and Massachusetts resolving similar charges.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to discriminate based on disability in the sale, rental, and financing of dwellings, and in other housing-related transactions, including refusing to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services. In addition, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.
""Discrimination against people with disabilities continues to be the most common type of housing discrimination complaint we receive each year,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""It's unacceptable and the cases we're announcing today reflect HUD's commitment to making sure housing opportunities are available to every American, including those with disabilities.""
Last year alone, HUD and its partners received more than 4,500 disability-related complaints, accounting for nearly 55 percent of all fair housing complaints that were filed.
Florida
HUD charged the owner of Hillcrest East Building No. 22, a multifamily development in Hollywood, Florida; the property's management company, Rhodes Management; and a previous president of the homeowners' association with housing discrimination for failing to make reasonable accommodations, publishing discriminatory notices and statements, and attempting to intimidate and retaliate against two family members who filed a housing discrimination complaint. One individual lives at the subject property, and the other person, who has a disability, was allegedly prevented from visiting her cousin at the subject property because she requires the use of an emotional support animal. HUD's charge also alleges that the owners and managers discriminated against persons with disabilities by requiring personal and unnecessary medical information in order to grant reasonable accommodations, and by prohibiting emotional support animals and their owners from having access to the development.

11/10/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-170.cfm,HUD Issues Guidance on How to Treat Tenants Fairly in Rental Assistance Demonstration,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today issued formal guidance to Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) and others participating in the Department's Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) on how to meet their fair housing, civil rights and relocation obligations during all phases of RAD's conversion process. Read HUD's notice (https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2016-27348.pdf).
RAD was authorized by Congress in 2012 to help stem the loss of public housing units by allowing local housing authorities to convert the current federal subsidy to a more stable long-term financing model for up to 185,000 public housing units. Just as private owners of single- and multi-family housing routinely rely upon debt financing as a means of undertaking physical improvements to their properties, RAD allows public housing authorities to safely leverage other sources of private capital in order to finance rehabilitation or in some cases completely replace distressed public housing.
Fundamental to the design of RAD, current and future residents are provided a robust set of rights and protections, including relocation options during the conversion process and the right to return to the property when repairs are completed. HUD's notice issued today is designed to guide RAD participants on how to make certain tenants are engaged early, treated fairly, and provided ample relocation options during construction.
Specifically, HUD's notice streamlines and accelerates the RAD approval process by:
Clearly outlining the requirements for fair housing and relocation reviews; Providing guidance on what documents to submit and when to submit them; and Offering tools such as a comprehensive checklist to help stakeholders prepare submissions.
• Clearly outlining the requirements for fair housing and relocation reviews;
• Providing guidance on what documents to submit and when to submit them; and
• Offering tools such as a comprehensive checklist to help stakeholders prepare submissions.
AD provides mobility benefits for assisted residents of converted properties through the choice mobility option, allowing these households to access tenant-based Housing Choice Vouchers. In some cases, RAD can be a tool for transfer of rental assistance from distressed or poorly selected sites to new sites in high opportunity areas. In all cases, the objective is to better serve low-income residents and the broader community in complying with fair housing, other civil rights, and relocation laws.
In Fiscal Year 2017, HUD is requesting that Congress eliminate the current 185,000 unit-cap on public housing units that can convert without additional HUD subsidy. PHAs have already applied and received initial awards up to this cap and a waiting list has now formed. Eliminating the cap will allow every PHA that wishes to participate the opportunity to leverage capital.
In September, HUD published an interim evaluation of RAD that demonstrated a leverage of nearly $9 for every $1 of public housing funds invested in RAD-converting properties. The report also highlighted that some public housing properties with more serious capital needs will not be able to be sufficiently improved without additional subsidy, which is why HUD is also proposing to provide $50 million to help local public housing agencies finance the deeper recapitalization of tens of thousands of units of public housing.

The supportive housing assistance announced today is provided through the HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) Program which combines rental assistance from HUD with case management and clinical services provided by VA.
The HUD-VASH Project Based Vouchers (PBVs) being awarded today are attached to specific existing, new construction or rehabilitated units. These vouchers will preserve affordable housing and ensure that persons who need services to live stably in their own homes receive them. See local funding chart below.
""Housing our nation's veterans has been a top priority of this Administration, and one at which we've been particularly successful,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""We take seriously our responsibility to ensure that those who have served their country in uniform have a home, and these vouchers will expand our success in ending veteran homelessness as we know it.""
""Increasing the supply of affordable housing is one of the keys to ending Veteran homelessness,"" said VA Secretary Robert A. McDonald. ""The project-based HUD-VASH vouchers announced today will increase the availability of affordable housing for the most vulnerable homeless Veterans in communities across the U.S. and ensure they have access to VA case management and supportive services to remain stably housed.""
In June, HUD awarded nearly $38 million to help more than 5,200 homeless veterans find homes. That funding ensured that communities could provide the critically needed housing assistance and case management services to those veterans and their families experiencing homelessness. In August, HUD announced that veteran homelessness in the U.S. was cut nearly in half since 2010. Read more about the effort to end veteran homelessness.
Since 2010, the Obama Administration and 19 federal agencies and offices that form the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH) launched the nation's first comprehensive strategy to prevent and end homelessness. Opening Doors: Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness (http://www.usich.gov/opening_doors/) serves as a roadmap for how the federal government will work with state and local communities to confront the root causes of homelessness, especially among former servicemen and women.
More than 79,000 vouchers have been awarded and approximately 111,000 homeless veterans have been served through the HUD-VASH program since 2008. Rental assistance and supportive services provided through HUD-VASH are a critical resource for local communities in ending homelessness among our nation's veterans.
In the HUD-VASH program, VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) assess veterans experiencing homelessness before referring them to local housing agencies for these vouchers. Decisions are based on a variety of factors, most importantly the duration of homelessness and the need for longer term, more intensive support in obtaining and maintaining permanent housing. The HUD-VASH program includes both the rental assistance the voucher provides and the comprehensive case management that VAMC staff offers.
Veterans participating in the HUD-VASH program rent privately owned housing and generally contribute no more than 30 percent of their income toward rent. VA offers eligible homeless veterans clinical and supportive services through its medical centers across the U.S., Guam, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands."

The independent actuarial analysis shows the MMI Fund's capital ratio grew by $3.8 billion and now stands at 2.32 percent—the second consecutive year since 2008 that FHA's reserve ratio exceeded the congressionally required 2 percent threshold.
This is the fourth consecutive year of economic growth for the MMI Fund, allowing FHA to expand credit access to qualified borrowers even as the broader housing market continues to recover. Read FHA's Annual Report to Congress.
""FHA's strong, sustained progress has helped fuel the housing market recovery over the past eight years,"" said HUD Secretary Julian Castro. ""Today's report once again confirms that our steps to maintain a financially sound Fund are paying off, giving more American families the opportunity to afford a home of their own.""
""FHA has come a long way since our housing crisis,"" said Ed Golding, HUD's Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Housing. ""With evidence that FHA's fundamentals are strong and improving, there is no doubt that FHA is making steady progress accumulating capital and, at the same time, improving access to credit for working families.""
Major Findings of FHA's Annual Report
The MMI Fund's capital ratio is above Congress' two percent requirement for the second consecutive year, standing at 2.32 percent. This is a 12 percent increase in the capital ratio and marks the fourth consecutive year that the net worth of the Fund has improved. The economic value of the MMI Fund gained $3.8 billion in Fiscal Year 2016 and is now valued at $27.6 billion. The Single Family Forward Portfolio gained $18.3 billion in value, outperforming the actuary's projections by $10.1 billion and achieved a capital ratio of 3.28 percent.

The FHA's Role in the Housing Market
The FHA was established in response to the failure of the banking system during the Great Depression to help stabilize the economy and the housing market. When the private market couldn't or wouldn't provide access to credit, FHA was there, investing in our economy and preserving pathways to the middle class - just as it was designed to do. During this most recent crisis, FHA provided critical access to credit when most needed. Today, FHA continues to support the housing recovery. the number of single-family loan endorsements has declined to pre-crisis levels. The decline in the number of FHA-insured single-family loan endorsements indicates the housing market and economy are beginning to recover.
Since 1934, FHA helped more than 46 million Americans purchase or refinance homes—nearly seven million of those just during the most recent crisis."
11/15/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-173.cfm,HUD Announces New Approach to Expand Choice and Opportunity for Section 8 Voucher Holders in Certain Housing Markets,"WASHINGTON - In some metropolitan areas of the country, families who depend upon the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) Program have limited choices about where they can find suitable affordable rental housing. Often, their housing choices are constrained and higher opportunity neighborhoods remain out of reach because of the current method of calculating their rental assistance. Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) finalized a new method to establish the Fair Market Rents (FMRs) upon which rental subsidies are based in a manner that would expand neighborhood options for households living in these particularly challenging housing markets.
HUD is changing the geography it uses to calculate FMRs in certain areas from a metropolitan area-wide approach to the zip code level as a means to expand the options these families have to live in lower poverty neighborhoods. This 'Small Area Fair Market Rent' approach is required in 24 metropolitan areas (see list below). Under HUD's rule, Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) operating in other metropolitan areas can opt to apply this new zip code based approach. Read HUD's Final Rule (https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-11-16/pdf/2016-27114.pdf).
""Today, we embark upon a new approach to offer more choice and greater opportunity for families struggling to find a decent place to call home,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""Moving to this approach will offer these voucher-holding families more opportunities to move into higher opportunity neighborhoods with better housing, better schools and higher paying jobs.""
HUD's Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research Katherine M. O'Regan added, ""This new method of looking at Fair Market Rents offers real choice to voucher-assisted families. The final rule we announce today is the product of a lot of listening. In the end, this new smaller area approach focuses on expanding housing opportunities for families, safeguarding current tenants, and ensuring housing agencies continue to have enough flexibility and discretion to address local circumstances.""
HUD considered and incorporated feedback from the significant public input and comments that it received during the development of this final rule. Read a summary of key changes between the Proposed and Final rule (https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/fmr/fmr2016f/SAFMR-Key-Aspects-of-Final-Rule.pdf).
Background
Fair Market Rents (FMRs) are gross rent estimates that are used to calculate the maximum subsidy HUD provides families receiving rental assistance, including the 2.2 million households assisted through the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) Program. These households generally contribute 30 percent of their adjusted monthly income toward their rent with the rental subsidy paying the rest. FMRs are usually set at the 40th percentile of all rents charged in an entire metropolitan area; although in 2000, HUD began to set this rent standard to the 50th percentile in areas where voucher families were highly concentrated.
The main objective of the 50th percentile program was to provide a broader range of housing choices that would enable voucher holders to move to areas of higher opportunity. However, research indicates that in many areas, rather than incentivizing voucher holders to move to higher opportunity neighborhoods, most of the additional subsidies provided through this approach appear to benefit landlords in the form of higher rents - in effect, artificially inflating rents in some higher poverty neighborhoods. HUD will phase out the 50th percentile program over the next three years and to calculate FMRs by zip codes within qualifying metropolitan areas as a mechanism to expand the choices available to these households. This Small Area Fair Market Rent approach is intended to increase voucher holders' access to a greater number of units in low poverty areas while reducing excess subsidy from some high poverty neighborhoods.
In metropolitan areas where there is a wide variance in the rents being charged to tenants and where voucher holders are concentrated in a few high-poverty neighborhoods, beginning in Fiscal Year 2018 HUD will calculate FMRs based upon the rents being charged by the zip codes within that area. This permits FMRs and the resulting payment standards to be higher in low-poverty/high-rent areas, and lower in high-poverty/low-rent areas.
The following Metropolitan Areas meet the Final Rule's criteria and thus are areas where HUD believes the SAFMRs will be most effective. As a result, these areas will be required to implement this new zip code based approach to calculating the rental assistance of voucher holders starting in FY2018:
Last year, a group of Harvard University social scientists published a study based largely on HUD data. This report sought to measure the long-term effects of moving families away from neighborhoods with deeply concentrated poverty to low-poverty environments and to gauge the impact these moves had on the overall well-being of these families. The authors found that children who moved to low-poverty neighborhoods when they were under age 13 are doing better as adults, with significantly higher earnings and a greater likelihood of having attended college. Findings from this study, along with HUD's own research, support the Department's current policy direction of fostering opportunities for economic mobility while also investing in place-based strategies that revitalize distressed neighborhoods."

HUD took over operational control of the HACL in March of 2011 for substantial default of the agency's obligations including financial mismanagement, misuse of funds, and a lack of leadership.
""Today is a significant milestone for Lafayette as this housing authority transitions back to local control,"" said Lourdes Castro-Ramirez, HUD'S Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing. ""After five years of hard work and collaboration, we're turning a new page today at the Housing Authority of the City of Lafayette. While there are so many people who made today possible, I want to especially thank HACL's residents for their cooperation and patience during this turnaround.""
Mayor Robideaux said. ""Following years of mismanagement and substandard housing for residents, HACL has reemerged and once again is focused to perform its mission. This has been a long time coming, but the people of Lafayette are ready to once again lead HACL.""
During the five years of HUD's control, HACL worked with its employees, residents and the city to correct long-standing deficiencies and comply with the terms of its Annual Contributions Contract (ACC) with HUD including:
Hiring a full-time Executive Director; Stabilizing its financial management; Making improvements to the housing stock; Increasing its Section 8 leasing by more than 200 families; Appointing a new Board of Commissioners with the expertise and training to effectively set policy; Moving to an asset management approach to managing its properties; Creating a new Resident Council; and Partnering with other housing providers in the Lafayette area.

Weaver Federal Building, located in Washington, D.C. Developed by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC), the LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) rating system is the most recognized program for buildings, homes and communities that are designed, constructed, maintained and operated for improved environmental and human health performance.
HUD staff and Honeywell International worked together to develop a robust energy project that provided self-funding/budget neutral major facility improvements, improved security and indoor air quality. These efforts lowered the Weaver building's energy usage by 47 percent, reduced the building's carbon footprint by 50 percent (the equivalent of removing 1830 cars from the road), and created nearly 400 jobs. Read more.
The renovation was funded through the Department of Energy's Regional Super Energy Savings Performance Contract (ESPC)-IDIQ. The initial $34 million contract was awarded in 2010 with a $5 million modification in 2014. The project was completely budget neutral and funded through guaranteed savings from HUD's existing energy and operations budget. The cumulative savings to HUD are in excess of $90 million over the 19-year project term. During the first year after construction, HUD realized $2.7 million in energy savings and realized a reduction in on-going maintenance and repair costs from their maintenance contractor.
HUD achieved LEED Silver for implementing practical and measurable strategies and solutions aimed at achieving high performance in: water savings, energy efficiency, materials selection, and indoor environmental quality. Facility improvements to the historic Robert C. Weaver Building included:
Envelope Improvements - 1,485 custom-made, high-performance energy-efficient / blast-resistant windows Major Mechanical Systems Replacement - Conversion of entire building to variable air volume Air Handling Units (AHUs), building of a central boiler plant, new chiller installation, Variable Frequency Drives (VFDS) pumps installation, humidification system and building-wide Energy Management Control System (EMCS) Energy-Efficient Lighting - Conversion of inefficient T12 fluorescent and incandescent lighting technology to newer, more efficient fixtures Water Conservation - Installation of low-flow retrofits to toilets, flush valves, sink aerators, kitchen equipment, cooling towers, and showers as water conservation retrofits.

11/17/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-176.cfm,Homelessness in the U.S. Continues to Decline,"WASHINGTON - Homelessness continues to decline in the U.S, specifically among families with children, Veterans, and individuals with long-term disabling conditions according to the latest national estimate by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). HUD's 2016 Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress (https://www.hudexchange.info/resources/documents/2016-AHAR-Part-1.pdf) found that 549,928 persons experienced homelessness on a single night in 2016, a decline of 14 percent since 2010, the year the Obama Administration launched Opening Doors, the nation's first comprehensive strategy to prevent and end homelessness.
Over this seven-year period, HUD estimates the nation experienced a 23 percent reduction among homeless families, a 47 percent drop in Veteran homelessness, and a 27 percent decline in individuals experiencing chronic homelessness. This national estimate is based upon data reported by approximately 3,000 cities and counties across the nation. Every year on a single night in January, planning agencies called 'Continuums of Care"" and tens of thousands of volunteers seek to identify the number of individuals and families living in emergency shelters, transitional housing programs and in unsheltered settings.
In making the announcement, HUD Secretary Julián Castro noted that though the nation is making significant progress in reducing homelessness, the number of 'doubled up' or rent-burdened families remains a vexing problem.
""Every person deserves a safe, stable place to call home,"" said Secretary Castro. ""The Obama Administration has made unprecedented progress toward ending homelessness and today marks the seventh straight year of measureable progress. While we know that our work is far from finished, it's clear we're on the right track to prevent and end homelessness for good.""
""While our continued progress reinforces that we are on the right path, the data also makes clear that we must increase the pace of that progress,"" said Matthew Doherty, Executive Director of the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness. ""To do so, we must be unwavering in our commitment to strategies and investments that are working. Our communities and our citizens deserve nothing less.""
During one night in late January of 2016, tens of thousands of volunteers across the nation sought to identify individuals and families living on their streets as well as in emergency shelters and transitional housing programs. These one-night 'snapshot' counts, as well as full-year counts and data from other sources (U.S. Housing Survey, Department of Education), are crucial in understanding the scope of homelessness and measuring progress toward reducing it.
Key Findings of HUD's 2016 Annual Homeless Assessment Report:
On a single night in January 2016, state and local planning agencies reported:
549,928 people were homeless representing an overall 14 percent reduction from January 2010. Most homeless persons (373,571) were located in emergency shelters or transitional housing programs while 176,357 persons were unsheltered. The number of families with children experiencing homelessness declined 23 percent since 2010. Veteran homelessness dropped by 47 percent (or 34,616 persons) since January 2010. On a single night in January 2016, 39,471 veterans were experiencing homelessness. Chronic or long-term homelessness among individuals declined by 27 percent (or 77,486 persons) since 2010. The number of unaccompanied homeless youth and children appeared to decline in 2016 to 35,686 though HUD will launch a more robust effort to more accurately account for this important population in January of 2017.

The Obama Administration's strategic plan to end homelessness is called Opening Doors - a roadmap for joint action by the 19 federal member agencies of the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness along with local and state partners in the public and private sectors. The Plan offers strategies to connect mainstream housing, health, education, and human service programs as part of a coordinate plan to prevent and end homelessness.
Family Homelessness
There were 61,265 family households experiencing homelessness on a single night in 2016, a nearly 23 percent decline since 2010. Meanwhile, the number of persons in families declined by nearly 20 percent during that time, due in large measure to the expansion of Rapid Rehousing Programs across the country and a concerted effort by local planners to reallocate scarce resources in a more strategic way.
Veteran Homelessness
Since the launch of Opening Doors, several states and local communities have declared an effective end to Veteran homelessness. As a consequence of intense planning and targeted intervention, homelessness among veterans fell by nearly 50 percent since 2010.This decline is largely attributed to the close collaboration between HUD and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs on a joint program called HUD-VA Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH). Since 2008, more than 79,000 rental vouchers have been awarded and approximately 111,000 formerly homeless veterans are currently in homes of their own because of HUD-VASH.
Chronic Homelessness
Long-term or chronic homelessness among individuals declined 27 percent since 2010. This reduction is due in part to a concerted effort to make available more permanent supportive housing opportunities for people with disabling health conditions who otherwise continually cycle through local shelters or the streets. Research demonstrates that for those experiencing chronic homelessness, providing permanent housing, coupled with appropriate low-barrier supportive services, is the most effective solution for ending homelessness. This 'housing first' approach also saves the taxpayer considerable money by interrupting a costly cycle of emergency room and hospital, detox, and even jail visits.
While homelessness nationally continues to decline, some communities are reporting less progress. Read more information on state/local-level homelessness (https://www.hudexchange.info/resource/5178/2016-ahar-part-1-pit-estimates-of-homelessness/)."
11/17/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-178.cfm,Renters More Likely to be Food Insecure than Homeowners,"WASHINGTON - About 10.5 million American households, or roughly 8.9 percent, reported that in the past month their access to adequate food was limited by a lack of money and other resources, according to new 2015 American Housing Survey (http://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/ahs/data.html) data released today by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Census Bureau. Learn more about the 2015 American Housing Survey (http://sasweb.ssd.census.gov/ahs/ahstablecreator.html#?s_areas=a00000&s_year= n2015&s_tableName=Table1&s_byGroup1=a1&s_byGroup2=a1&s_filterGroup1=t1&s_filterGroup2=g1).
For the first time in its 42-year history, the American Housing Survey included questions on food security status, which allowed HUD to assign households a ""food security status"" score. Using these categories, about 10.5 million occupied households were classified as having ""low"" or ""very low"" food security, which is commonly known as being ""food insecure.""
The survey also looked at homeownership, race, and having a disability in relation to food security. Results showed that 4.9 percent of homeowners and 15.5 percent of renters were food insecure, meaning they had ""low"" or ""very low"" food security.
""For over 40 years, the American Housing Survey has been America's premier source of data on housing costs and quality,"" said Katherine O' Regan, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research. ""Working closely with experts at the Department of Agriculture, we added food insecurity to this survey to better understand the balance many lower income households face between the cost and quality of their housing and putting food on the table.""
The Department of Housing and Urban Development in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture included the questions to determine whether the dietary quality or food consumption of household members was reduced or normal eating patterns were disrupted because the household lacked money for food any time during the last month. One adult respondent per household was asked questions about experiences and behaviors that indicate food insecurity, such as being unable to afford balanced meals, cutting the size of meals because of too little money for food, or being hungry because of too little money for food.
The American Housing Survey is collected every other year by the Census Bureau and is the most comprehensive housing survey in the United States. It covers topics such as housing characteristics, housing costs, home improvements and neighborhood characteristics. In addition to food insecurity, the 2015 American Housing Survey includes three other new topics: the health and safety of homes, use of housing counseling, and importance of arts and culture. In addition to these topics, new questions explore the opinions of Americans on petty and major crime, satisfaction with schools, satisfaction with public transportation and risk for flooding or disasters.
Results showed that 16.9 percent of black householders, 19.5 percent of American Indian and Alaska Native householders, and 21.4 percent of Pacific Islander householders were food insecure, all significantly higher than that of white householders, at 7.5 percent.
About 16.6 percent of households with a person with a disability were food insecure, reporting ""low"" or ""very low"" food security, as opposed to 6.9 percent of households without a person with a disability.
In addition to the new survey topics, the American Housing Survey covers topics such as physical housing characteristics and financial characteristics. Below are highlights from the 2015 national and metropolitan statistical area level findings among the 118,290,000 occupied units. More information on 25 selected metropolitan areas will be available later this year.
Housing Costs
The median cost for electricity was $104 per month (renters $82, owners $117), $53 per month for piped gas (renters $42, owners $58), and $133 per month for fuel oil (renters $100, owners $150). Median rent was $790 per month. This ranged from $250 for ""other units,"" such as boats, RVs or vans to $833 for single-unit, attached homes. The median monthly cost paid for water was $46 per month.

Financing a Home
Of the 70.4 million households that purchased or built their homes, 13.2 percent had no down payment; 12.6 percent put 5 percent or less down; 12.9 percent had a down payment of 6 to 10 percent; 18.0 percent put 11 to 20 percent down, 15.2 percent put 21 percent or more down; and 8.4 percent bought the home outright. The rest did not report. Of owner-occupied units, 40.9 percent were owned free and clear, 53.6 percent had at least one regular or home-equity lump-sum mortgage only, and 5.0 percent had at least one home equity line of credit. The remainder had reverse mortgages. Most homeowners with a regular and/or home-equity mortgage had only one mortgage (95.0 percent), 5.0 percent had two mortgages and less than 1.0 percent had three or more. Well over a third, or 38.4 percent, of homeowners with a primary mortgage refinanced. While most refinanced for a lower interest rate, 71.2 percent (11.5 million homeowners), others did so to receive cash, 11.7 percent. The median amount of cash received from refinance was $28,000. The median percent of that spent on home additions, improvements and repairs was 10.0.

Owner Home Improvement
In a typical year, owners spent a median of $500 on routine maintenance or regular maintenance activities necessary for the preventive care of the structure, property and equipment. Such activities included painting, fixing leaks, repairing fences, cleaning gutters and removing dangerous trees. There were 43.9 million households, or 59.0 percent, that performed more than 123.5 million home improvement projects, other than routine maintenance, in the last two years, spending more than $431.1 billion, with a median of $1,200 per job. Around one third, or 33.6 percent, of owner-occupied units had at least one home improvement project in the last two years completed for energy efficiency purposes, 6.8 percent did at least one project to improve accessibility for an elderly person or a person with a disability, and 3.5 percent did at least one project to prepare the home for sale.

Neighborhood
Householders of about 18.1 percent of all occupied housing units reported living near a body of water, and 14.4 percent of those reported that the unit was actually on waterfront property. In contrast, nearly 46.0 percent of all seasonal units were near a body of water, 53.5 percent of which were located on waterfront property. Of the 59.8 million housing units in subdivisions (including multiunits and groups of mobile homes), 15.1 percent were located in secured communities with walls or fences, comprising 7.6 percent of all occupied units. Of the 21.8 percent of all occupied housing units with a person age 55 or over, 11.3 percent were located in age-restricted communities. Of the remaining 88.7 percent, 24.4 percent said the majority of their neighbors are age 55 or over.

11/18/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-177.cfm,HUD and Census Bureau Announce New Residential Construction Activity in October,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Census Bureau jointly announced the following new residential construction statistics for October 2016:
BUILDING PERMITS
Privately owned housing units authorized by building permits in October were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,229,000. This is 0.3 percent (±2.0%) above the revised September rate of 1,225,000, but is 4.6 percent (±1.4%) above the October 2015 estimate of 1,175,000. Single-family authorizations in October were at a rate of 762,000; this is 2.7 percent (±1.4%) above the revised September figure of 742,000. Authorizations of units in buildings with five units or more were at a rate of 439,000 in October.
HOUSING STARTS
Privately owned housing starts in October were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,323,000. This is 25.5 percent (±12.6%) above the revised September estimate of 1,054,000, but is 23.3 percent (±14.4%) above the October 2015 rate of 1,073,000. Single-family housing starts in October were at a rate of 869,000; this is 10.7 percent (±10.2%) above the revised September figure of 785,000. The October rate for units in buildings with five units or more was 445,000.
HOUSING COMPLETIONS
Privately owned housing completions in October were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,055,000. This is 5.5 percent (±10.1%)* above the revised September estimate of 1,000,000 and is 7.2 percent (±12.3%)* above the October 2015 rate of 984,000. Single-family housing completions in October were at a rate of 749,000; this is 3.9 percent (±11.3%)* above the revised September rate of 721,000. The October rate for units in buildings with five units or more was 300,000.
EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take two months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, 4 months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2%) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90-percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised about three percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found on our web site listed above.
* 90% confidence interval includes zero. The Census Bureau does not have sufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero.

11/22/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-179.cfm,HUD Announces New Formula for Indian Housing Block Grant Program,"WASHINGTON - After three years of negotiation with federally and state-recognized tribes across the country, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced a new funding formula used to allocate funds through the Indian Housing Block Grant (IHBG) Program. Read HUD's new rule (https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/11/22/2016-27208/native-american-housing-assistance-and-self-determination-act-revisions-to-the-indian-housing-block).
The Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 (NAHASDA) requires HUD to update IHBG's funding formula periodically through a negotiated rulemaking process with grant recipients. As a result of this process and a year-long study of potential data sources to be used in this formula, HUD reached a consensus on most issues. The proposed rule was announced in May 2016 and reflected HUD's decisions for both consensus and non-consensus issues, with the intention of improving and clarifying the current regulations.
The IHBG Formula Negotiated Rulemaking Committee consisted of two HUD staff and representatives of 24 designated tribal governments (or authorized designees of those tribal governments) which reflects a balanced representation of Indian tribes geographically and based on size.
""HUD's commitment to honoring our government-to-government relationship with tribal nations resulted in this new negotiated rule,"" said Lourdes Castro Ramírez, HUD's Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing. ""We thank the dedicated and knowledgeable tribal representatives for their meaningful engagement.""
""This process was very important and collaborative, and took all comments into serious consideration before making final decisions,"" said Negotiated Rulemaking Committee Co-Chairs Jason Dollarhide and Annette Bryan. ""The committee worked in good faith in a consensus decision-making process with the goal of doing what was in the best interest of all tribes.""
The IHBG Program is the single largest source of affordable housing assistance in Native American communities. Over the life of the program, recipients built or acquired nearly 37,000 affordable homes and have rehabilitated more than 77,000 others.
The IHBG allocations are distributed each year to eligible Indian tribes or their tribally designated housing entities for a range of affordable housing activities. Through the program, HUD provides federal housing assistance for Indian tribes in a manner that recognizes the right of Indian self-determination and tribal self-government. In February, HUD announced more than $660 million in grant allocations to 587 Native American tribes in 35 states for fiscal year 2016. The funds benefit low-income families living on Indian reservations or in other American Indian and Alaska Native communities. The amount of each grant is based on a formula that considers local needs and housing units under management by the tribe or designated entity.
Eligible activities for the funds include housing development, assistance to housing developed under the Indian Housing Program of the 1937 Housing Act, housing services to eligible families and individuals, housing management services, crime prevention and safety, and HUD-approved model activities that provide creative approaches to solving affordable housing problems. The block grant approach to housing was enabled by the Native American Housing Assistance and Self Determination Act of 1996 (NAHASDA)."
11/22/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-180.cfm,HUD Announces Housing Discrimination Settlement Between Denver Fair Housing Group and Colorado Landlords,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today an agreement resolving allegations that the owners and manager of an apartment complex in Littleton, Colorado, discriminated against families with children and people with disabilities. The voluntary conciliation agreement settles a complaint brought by Denver Metro Fair Housing Center against owners George and Helen Turk, along with their property management company, Katchen & Company, Inc., who were accused of having a 'no kids' policy and limiting housing options for persons with disabilities. Read the agreement.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing discrimination in the sale, rental, and financing of housing-related transactions, based on disability and familial status. This landmark law specifically protects families with children under 18 and requires housing providers to make reasonable accommodations for persons with disabilities.
""Families with children and residents with disabilities have a hard enough time finding housing that meets their needs without having to face unlawful discrimination,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will continue working with our partners to make certain housing providers meet their obligations under the Fair Housing Act.""
The matter came to HUD's attention when Denver Metro Fair Housing Center (DMFHC) and a Denver-area family with children filed complaints alleging that the owners and manager of Langford Apartments discriminated against families with children. The fair housing group complaint alleged that a man looking for an apartment for himself, his wife, and his toddler son responded to a Craigslist ad for a unit at the complex and was told by the on-site manager, who was employed by Katchen & Company, Inc., that Langford Apartments did not rent to families with children.
In subsequent tests conducted by the DMFHC, another on-site manager allegedly told a tester, ""no kids,"" and ""we don't accept children."" The manager also allegedly told a tester posing as a deaf person that ""we don't allow service animals,"" and ""if you're deaf I don't think this is the place for you.""
Under the agreement, the Turks will pay DMFHC and the complaining family $70,000, provide Katchen employees with fair housing training, and establish a company-wide antidiscrimination policy. In addition, future ads for Langford Apartments units will include explicit language encouraging families with children and people with disabilities to apply.
Any person who believes she or he has experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to www.hud.gov/fairhousing, or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, which can be accessed through Apple and Android devices."
11/23/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-181.cfm,HUD Announces Fair Housing Agreement with Los Angeles Landlords to Settle Discrimination Complaints,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced an agreement with the owners and operators of Swansea Park Senior Apartments in Los Angeles to resolve allegations that they violated fair housing laws for refusing to allow a resident with disabilities to have a live-in aide and making discriminatory statements to him. Read the Voluntary Compliance Agreement (VCA).
The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in the sale or rental of a dwelling because of disability, including the refusal to make reasonable accommodations in policies or practices when a person with a disability requires such an accommodation. This includesbeing allowed to have a live-in caregiver in a unit when it is necessary. In addition, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.
""Persons with disabilities have a right to the reasonable accommodations they need to use and enjoy their home without being subjected to discriminatory statements or unnecessary barriers,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will continue to work with housing providers to ensure that they meet their obligation to comply with our nation's fair housing laws.""
The agreement announced today follows a complaint filed by a resident with disabilities who was denied a reasonable request to have his daughter reside with him as his live-in aide. The manager allegedly advised the resident that if he was that sick he should not be living at the property and that if he needed assistance during the night, he should call 911. The manager also allegedly told the resident that she had blacklisted him and would check his apartment nightly to see if he had secretly let anyone in. Because his reasonable accommodation request was denied, the man's daughter had to shuttle him back and forth between her home and his home in order to care for him.
Under the terms of the agreement, the respondents will, among other things, pay the man $15,000, allow his daughter to be his live-in aide, undergo fair housing training, and adjust their reasonable accommodation policy.
Disability is the most common basis of complaint filed with HUD and its partner agencies. Last year alone, HUD and its State and local partners considered more than 4,500 disability-related complaints or nearly 55 percent of all fair housing complaints.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY).

Read the agreement.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from denying or limiting housing to persons with disabilities, or from refusing to make reasonable accommodations in policies or practices for people with disabilities. In addition, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.
""When residents with disabilities request reasonable accommodations, it's because they need them to be able to enjoy their home. They aren't asking for special treatment,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will continue to work to ensure that property owners and managers understand their responsibilities under the law.""
The case came to HUD's attention when a complaint was filed by a female resident of Alicia Park Apartments in Laguna Niguel, California who is mobility impaired and her daughter, who has a respiratory disability. The resident alleged that the owners and managers refused their reasonable accommodation request to be moved to a different first-floor unit without carpet. The unit in which the women lived was allegedly mold infested due to two pipe ruptures. Additionally, the women claimed that their request for a designated accessible parking space next to their unit was denied.
Under the terms of the agreement, G & K Management Company and the owners of Alicia Park Apartments will pay the women $17,500; replace the carpet with flooring; eradicate the mold and dirt in the women's unit; add an accessible curb cut next to a parking space that was provided after the women filed their complaint; and sign a one-year lease with the women.
The owners of the property will also provide fair housing training for staff; modify their fair housing policy to include a reasonable accommodation policy; appoint a reasonable accommodation coordinator; and keep a log of reasonable accommodation requests and the actions taken in response.
Disability is the most common basis of complaint filed with HUD and its partner agencies. Last year alone, HUD considered more than 4,500 disability-related complaints or nearly 55 percent of all fair housing complaints.

11/23/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-183.cfm,HUD and Census Bureau Report New Residential Sales in October,"WASHINGTON - Sales of new single-family houses in October 2016 were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 563,000, according to estimates released jointly today by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Census Bureau. This is 1.9 percent (±13.1%)* below the revised September rate of 574,000, but is 17.8 percent (±16.9%) above the October 2015 estimate of 478,000.
The median sales price of new houses sold in October 2016 was $304,500; the average sales price was $354,900. The seasonally adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of October was 246,000. This represents a supply of 5.2 months at the current sales rate.
New Residential Sales data for November 2016 will be released on Friday, December 23, 2016, at 10:00 A.M. EDT. Read more about new residential sales activity (www.census.gov/construction/nrs/index.html).
EXPLANATORY NOTES
These statistics are estimated from sample surveys. They are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated average relative standard errors of the preliminary data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2%) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90-percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. Changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show irregular movement. It takes 3 months to establish a trend for new houses sold. Preliminary new home sales figures are subject to revision due to the survey methodology and definitions used. The survey is primarily based on a sample of houses selected from building permits. Since a ""sale"" is defined as a deposit taken or sales agreement signed, this can occur prior to a permit being issued. An estimate of these prior sales is included in the sales figure. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimate of total sales is revised about 4 percent. Changes in sales price data reflect changes in the distribution of houses by region, size, etc., as well as changes in the prices of houses with identical characteristics. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found on our web site listed above.
* 90% confidence interval includes zero. The Census Bureau does not have sufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero."
11/30/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-184.cfm,HUD Secretary Castro Announces Public Housing to be Smoke-Free,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Julián Castro today announced that public housing developments in the U.S. will now be required to provide a smoke-free environment for their residents. In an address to local public housing officials, residents and public health professionals in Boston, Secretary Castro said HUD's new rule will provide resources and support to more than 3,100 Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) to implement required smoke-free policies over the next 18 months. Read HUD's final rule.
Throughout this year, HUD worked with PHAs and stakeholders collaboratively to finalize this rule, which prohibits lit tobacco products (cigarettes, cigars or pipes) in all living units, indoor common areas, administrative offices and all outdoor areas within 25 feet of housing and administrative office buildings. HUD's final rule included input from more than 1,000 comments from PHAs, housing and health partners, and tenant advocates.
""Every child deserves to grow up in a safe, healthy home free from harmful second-hand cigarette smoke,"" said Secretary Castro. ""HUD's smoke-free rule is a reflection of our commitment to using housing as a platform to create healthy communities. By working collaboratively with public housing agencies, HUD's rule will create healthier homes for all of our families and prevent devastating and costly smoking-related fires.""
Since 2009, HUD has strongly encouraged PHAs to adopt smoke-free policies in their buildings and common areas, a policy many private housing developments already have in place. During this time, more than 600 PHAs and Tribally Designated Housing Entities (TDHEs) have adopted smoke-free policies.Through HUD's voluntary policy and local initiatives, more than 228,000 public housing units are already smoke-free. Once fully implemented, the smoke-free rule announced today would expand the impact to more than 940,000 public housing units, including more than 500,000 units inhabited by elderly residents and 760,000 children living in public housing.
""My office has long warned the public about the dangers of smoking, including second-hand smoke,"" said U.S. Surgeon General Vivek H. Murthy. ""For children who are exposed to second-hand smoke, it can mean everything from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome and ear infections to asthma. Protecting our children and families from the devastation caused by secondhand smoke must be a priority for all sectors of our society, including public housing.""
HUD's smoke-free rule will reduce damage and maintenance costs associated with smoking. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), HUD's national smoke-free policy will save public housing agencies $153 million every year in repairs and preventable fires, including $94 million in secondhand smoke-related health care, $43 million in renovation of smoking-permitted units, and $16 million in smoking-related fire losses.It is estimated that smoking causes more than 100,000 fires each year nationwide, resulting in more than 500 deaths and nearly a half a billion dollars in direct property damage.
""Protecting people from secondhand smoke saves lives and saves money,"" said CDC Director, Tom Frieden, M.D., M.P.H. ""This is especially important in the places where we live. No level of secondhand smoke exposure is safe, and the home is the primary source of secondhand smoke for children.""
The CDC estimates cigarette smoking kills 480,000 Americans each year, making it the leading preventable cause of death in the United States. In addition, smoking is the lead cause of fire-related deaths in multifamily buildings. HUD's smoke-free rule will protect the health of public housing residents by reducing the health risks associated with tobacco use and exposure to secondhand smoke.
PHAs are encouraged to take advantage of the information and resources on HUD's Healthy Homes website. Updated guidance and training materials will be available in the coming months."
12/01/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-185.cfm,FHA Loan Limits to Rise in 2017,"WASHINGTON - The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) today announced the agency's new schedule of loan limits, and due to an increase in housing prices, most areas in the country will see a slight increase in loan limits in 2017. These loan limits are effective for case numbers assigned on or after January 1, 2017, and will remain in effect through the end of the year.
In high-cost areas, the FHA national loan limit ""ceiling"" will increase to $636,150 from $625,500. FHA will also increase its ""floor"" to $275,665 from $271,050. Additionally, the maximum claim amount for FHA-insured Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECMs), or reverse mortgages, will increase to $636,150. This amount is 150 percent of the national conforming limit of $424,100.
Due to changes in housing prices and the resulting change to FHA's ""floor"" and ""ceiling"" limits, the maximum loan limits for forward mortgages increased in 2,948 counties. There were no areas with a decrease in the maximum loan limits for forward mortgages though they remain unchanged in 286 counties.
FHA's minimum national loan limit ""floor"" is set at 65 percent of the national conforming loan limit of $424,100. The floor applies to those areas where 115 percent of the median home price is less than 65 percent of the national conforming loan limit.
Any areas where the loan limit exceeds the ""floor"" is considered a high cost area. The maximum FHA loan limit ""ceiling"" for high-cost areas is 150 percent of the national conforming limit. To find a complete list of FHA loan limits, areas at the FHA ceiling, areas between the floor and the ceiling, as well as a list of areas with loan limit increases, visit FHA's Loan Limits Page.
FHA calculates forward mortgage limits based on median house prices in accordance with the National Housing Act. FHA's Single Family forward mortgage limits are set by Metropolitan Statistical Area and county. Loan limits for reverse mortgages are also calculated but these do not vary by MSA or county; instead, a single limit applies to all mortgages in the regardless of where they are originated."

The Resident Opportunities and Self Sufficiency (ROSS) for Education Program, also known as Project SOAR (Students + Opportunities + Achievements = Results), is a new demonstration program that provides grant funding to public housing authorities to deploy education navigators to help public housing youth ages of 15-20 and their families apply for the U.S. Department of Education's Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), as well as assist with financial literacy and college readiness, post-secondary program applications and post-acceptance assistance.
""Achieving the dream of a college education is becoming more of a reality for hundreds of students living in HUD-assisted housing,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""This is an investment in our young people by putting them on a path to a college degree and creating greater opportunity to more prosperous lives.""
HUD awarded grants to the following public housing authorities:
*Read project summaries of the grants announced today.
Increased access to higher education can significantly improve life outcomes. The Department of Education estimates that those who earn a bachelor's degree earn two-thirds more than those with only a high school diploma or an average of $1 million more in lifetime earnings. In addition, college graduates are far less likely to face unemployment. It's also estimated that within the next four years, two-thirds of all new full-time jobs will require a college education.
ROSS for Education is one of several HUD initiatives to increase access to federal financial aid for HUD-assisted families and students."
12/12/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-188.cfm,"HUD Awards $132 Million to Five Communities to Revitalize Housing, Surrounding Neighborhoods","WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Julián Castro today announced that five communities across the U.S. will receive more than a combined $132 million to redevelop severely distressed public or assisted housing and revitalize surrounding neighborhoods. During a press conference and tour of one such neighborhood in St. Louis with Mayor Francis G. Slay, Secretary Castro announced the following communities will receive grants awarded through HUD's Choice Neighborhoods Initiative: Denver; Louisville, Kentucky; Boston; St. Louis; and Camden, New Jersey.
The Choice Neighborhoods Initiative is part of the Administration's drive to reinvest in neighborhoods of concentrated poverty by revitalizing distressed federally supported housing into sustainable, mixed-income housing with access to transit, better schools and jobs.
""These game-changing investments will breathe new life into distressed neighborhoods and offer real opportunities for the families who call these communities home,"" Castro said. ""What we do today will leverage private investment and bear fruit for generations of families looking for an opportunity to thrive in neighborhoods that are connected to the economic and social fabric of their communities.""
The five awardees will replace 1,853 severely distressed public housing units with nearly 3,700 new mixed-income, mixed-use housing units as part of an overall effort to revitalize neighborhoods. For every $1 in Choice Neighborhoods funding they receive, the awardees and their partners will leverage an additional $5 in public and private funding for their project proposals. Together, these five awardees are leveraging $636 million through other public/private sources and expect to stimulate another $3.3 billion indirectly to magnify their impact. The five award recipients are also past Choice Neighborhoods Planning Grant recipients. After a two-year planning process, today's award announcement provides funding to make each community's vision a reality.
HUD received 34 applications for the FY2016 Choice Neighborhoods Implementation Grants. The following communities will receive grant funding:
Read a summary of each the grants announced today.
Choice Neighborhoods build on the successes of HUD's HOPE VI Program, linking housing improvements with a wide variety of public services and neighborhood improvements to create neighborhoods of opportunity. With today's announcement, HUD has awarded more than $633 million in Choice Implementation Grants since 2011. Choice Neighborhoods is focused on three core goals:
• Housing: Replace distressed public and assisted housing with high-quality mixed-income housing that is well-managed and responsive to the needs of the surrounding neighborhood;
• People: Improve educational outcomes and intergenerational mobility for youth with services and supports delivered directly to youth and their families; and
• Neighborhood: Create the conditions necessary for public and private reinvestment in distressed neighborhoods to offer the kinds of amenities and assets, including safety, good schools, and commercial activity, that are important to families' choices about their community.
Choice Neighborhoods is HUD's signature place-based program, which supports innovative and inclusive strategies that bring public and private partners together to help break the cycle of intergenerational poverty. The program also encourages collaboration between HUD and the Departments of Education, Justice, Treasury and Health and Human Services to support local solutions for sustainable, mixed-income neighborhoods with the affordable housing, safe streets and good schools all families need."
12/13/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-189.cfm,HUD Charges Utah Landlords with Discriminating Against Residents with Disabilities,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is charging the owner and manager of a Salt Lake City apartment complex with housing discrimination for allegedly violating the Fair Housing Act by denying the reasonable accommodation requests of residents with disabilities. Read the charge.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from denying or limiting housing to persons with disabilities, or from refusing to make reasonable accommodations in policies or practices for people with disabilities.
""For nearly three decades, people with disabilities have had a right to request the reasonable accommodations they need to fully enjoy their homes, but that right is still being denied,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will continue to take actions that ensure that property owners and managers understand their rights and responsibilities under the law and take steps to comply with those obligations.""
The case came to HUD's attention when the Disability Law Center filed a fair housing complaint with HUD on behalf of a female resident with disabilities at Pine Cove Apartments, in Salt Lake City, who alleged that the owner, BJJ Enterprises, and the manager of the 48-unit complex had denied her request to keep an assistance animal. The Disability Law Center conducted fair housing tests, which revealed evidence that Pine Cove managers discriminated against people with disabilities. According to HUD's Charge, Pine Cove strictly adheres to its ""no-pets"" policy, even when medical documentation attesting to the need for a reasonable accommodation is presented.
Disability is the most common basis of complaint filed with HUD and its partner agencies. Last year alone, HUD and its partners considered more than 4,500 disability-related complaints, nearly 55 percent of all fair housing complaints.
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge. If the administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages to the complainants for their loss as a result of the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties in order to vindicate the public interest.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to www.hud.gov/fairhousing, or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, which can be accessed through Apple and Android devices."
12/14/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-190.cfm,HUD Announces New Housing Counseling Certification Requirements,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced it will require that housing counselors participating in HUD programs to be certified to offer counseling services to consumers. In order to become certified, housing counselors must pass a standardized written examination and work for a HUD-approved housing counseling agency (HCA).
Counselors must demonstrate competency in each of the following areas of housing counseling: (1) financial management; (2) property maintenance; (3) responsibilities of homeownership and tenancy; (4) fair housing laws and requirements; (5) housing affordability; and (6) avoidance of, and responses to, rental and mortgage delinquency and avoidance of eviction and mortgage default. Read HUD's final rule (https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=HUD_FRDOC_0001-4720).
Though announced today, HUD's final rule will take full effect three years following the release of the certification examination. To help counselors prepare for the exam, the Department is offering intensive training and study resources (in English and Spanish) to its counseling stakeholders. HUD is providing a wealth of resources to individuals seeking HUD certification including a practice test that will be available shortly and the actual certification test is expected to be published in the Spring of 2017.
In response to the recent housing crisis, Congress recognized the value of HUD-approved housing counseling services to help struggling families and directed the Department to develop a standard certification process to increase the competency of counselors in the full range of housing issues confronting consumers. HUD-certified counselors will also help to protect consumers from those fraudulent operators who prey upon those experiencing mortgage difficulties. Even legitimate for-profit housing counselors can charge consumers hundreds of dollars for services that are provided free or at low-cost by HUD-approved counselors.
Once HUD's rule is fully implemented, housing counseling required by HUD or provided in connection with any HUD program will meet common standards and will be delivered by a HUD certified counselor working for a HUD-approved housing counseling agency. HUD will manage an online database of HUD-approved housing counseling agencies and certified counselors for consumers and partners to rely upon. HUD certification will allow consumers to quickly find a trusted, impartial and knowledgeable advisor who is required to put the consumer's best interests first.
Independent research shows that consumers working with a HUD housing counseling agency have better credit, more savings, and fewer foreclosures than similar non-counseled consumers.

Read the Voluntary Compliance Agreement.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from denying or limiting housing to persons with disabilities, or from refusing to make reasonable accommodations in policies or practices for people with disabilities. In addition, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.
""Landlords have a legal responsibility to approve reasonable accommodations for tenants with disabilities,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Agreements like this help housing providers better understand their responsibilities, particularly their obligation to comply with the reasonable accommodation requirements of the Fair Housing Act and Section 504.""
The case came to HUD's attention after a mother of a son with disabilities filed a complaint alleging that the housing authority failed to grant her request to be transferred to a three-bedroom unit in order to accommodate medical equipment her son required. The housing authority initially informed the mother that it would grant the accommodation, but failed to do so in a timely manner.
Under the agreement, the housing authority will pay the woman $50,000; exempt her from paying rent for six and a half years, which equates to a monetary value of $40,170; provide fair housing training for its staff; submit a reasonable accommodation policy and procedure to HUD for review and approval; and post a fair housing poster in the public space of all of its offices.
Disability is the most common basis of complaint filed with HUD and its partner agencies. Last year alone, HUD considered more than 4,500 disability-related complaints or nearly 55 percent of all fair housing complaints.

As part of this commitment, T-Mobile will also become a national stakeholder in the Obama Administration's ConnectHome initiative (http://connecthome.hud.gov/). Beginning in January, the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) will distribute the tablets - valued at $159 each - to qualifying families with children under 19 years old.
""The ConnectHome program is providing children and families the tools they need to stay competitive in this 21stcentury global economy,"" said U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro. ""With this new commitment to ConnectHome, T-Mobile and the City of New York are making a meaningful impact to close the digital divide for thousands of New York public housing residents.""
""Increasing internet access across the city is not just a noble goal - it's a necessary one. These days, the internet is virtually a requirement for people searching for jobs or students doing homework. We are thrilled to find one more way to boost access in the Bronx - and we're thankful to our partners at T-Mobile and HUD for helping to make this happen,"" said Mayor Bill de Blasio.
""At T-Mobile, we believe high-speed internet access should be affordable for everyone. We're proud to partner with NYC and HUD to bring unlimited mobile internet to so many deserving families for years to come,"" said Mike Sievert, Chief Operating Officer of T-Mobile. ""We've invested like crazy in our network, and that's why T-Mobile has the fastest LTE network in NYC today. These families are getting blazing-fast mobile internet that works all over the city.""
This investment is part of the de Blasio Administration's commitment to expanding internet access, which recognizes that high-speed internet is no longer a luxury but a critical service that must be affordable to all city residents.
The tablets come preloaded with apps and links connecting users to City services and directories, including the award-winning (http://www1.nyc.gov/site/nycha/about/press/pr-2016/NYCHA-Recognized-as-Leader-in-Information-Technology-20160428.page) MyNYCHA (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.NYCHA.Mobile.MyNYCHA&hl=en) app, the 311 (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gov.nyc.doitt.ThreeOneOne&hl=en) app, the New York Public Library's SimplyE (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.nypl.simplified.simplye&hl=en) app, ACCESS NYC (https://a069-access.nyc.gov/ACCESSNYC/application.do), mystudent.nyc (https://mystudent.nyc/), openebooks.net (http://openebooks.net/), and links to information on IDNYC (http://www1.nyc.gov/site/idnyc/index.page) and local computer centers. T-Mobile will provide free introductory training for recipients. In addition, the New York Public Library will expand digital literacy and mobile tablet training programs at nearby branches in the Bronx, which will help New Yorkers learn about computer and internet basics, social media, protecting online information and privacy, career development, coding, and more.
T-Mobile has committed $2 million in devices and discounted service for this initiative and the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications is overseeing and will be funding the two years of discounted high-speed mobile data for these tablets at a cost of $1.2 million. Eligible developments and the schedule for distribution events, including T-Mobile tablet trainings, will be announced in January 2017, when residents will be able to register for the tablets online or through a phone hotline. NYCHA will also distribute flyers to eligible residents prior to the opening of registration.
Nearly 26 percent of households in the Bronx have no internet at home and no mobile internet plan - well above the citywide rate of 19.8 percent. This commitment will bring affordable, high-speed internet access to more NYCHA households in the Bronx. The tablet distribution complements the Administration's $10 million investment (http://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/491-15/mayor-de-blasio-up-10-million-investment-free-broadband-service-five-nycha) in building wireless networks that serve public housing residents in the Queensbridge, Red Hook and Mott Haven, Jefferson and Stapleton Houses communities, which the Mayor and Secretary announced last year. Free Wi-Fi service launched this week for the first section of the Queensbridge Houses.
""ConnectHome is another integral component in the City's efforts to bring every New Yorker affordable high-speed internet access by 2025,"" said Anne Roest, Commissioner of the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications. ""Keeping children connected is crucial for their education, and DoITT is incredibly proud to contribute to this public-private partnership. We thank our partners HUD, T-Mobile, NYCHA, and NYPL for their collaboration, and we are excited to be closely involved in ConnectHome's planning and oversight.""
New York Housing Authority Chair and CEO Shola Olatoye said, ""Expanding internet access is crucial to strengthening pathways to opportunity in the 21st century. Thanks to this partnership, we are bringing free, high-speed internet access to 5,000 families living in public housing in the Bronx. As we work to preserve public housing for generations to come, we are proud to participate in an initiative that will create more connected communities.""
""The New York Public Library works every day to combat digital inequity, offering free programs, services, and classes to help the millions of New Yorkers who cannot afford internet at home or who need technology training,"" said New York Public Library President Tony Marx. ""This partnership with T-Mobile and the City of New York is a new way that we can help address the digital divide, and we are proud to participate.""
Launched by President Obama in 2015, the ConnectHome Initiative is a national pilot program bringing internet service providers, non-profits and the public and private sectors together to offer high-speed internet access, technical training, digital literacy programs, and devices for residents in HUD-assisted housing. New York City is one of 28 communities nationwide participating in the ConnectHome pilot program.
""Too many kids lose access to the internet when the school day ends, limiting their ability to do research, complete homework assignments, and communicate with teachers and classmates,"" said Jeff Zients, Director of the National Economic Council. ""Through ConnectHome, local leaders and Internet Service Providers are doing great work in communities across the country to ensure that children and their families at all income levels have access to the opportunity internet provides.""
According to a 2015 analysis by the Center for Economic Opportunity, 20 percent of New York City households do not have in-home internet service and 35 percent of households below the poverty line do not have any internet access at home, including via tablets or smartphones. Recent data on use of connected mobile devices by the Pew Research Center shows that one in five American adults rely on mobile devices, including smartphones and tablets, as their primary source for internet access, which in many cases is not sufficient for applying for jobs online or completing homework assignments, for example. According to Pew, half of this group has had to cancel or suspend their service because of financial constraints.
This commitment marks the latest action in the de Blasio administration's ongoing work to close the technology divide in New York City and make New York the most connected and equitable city in the world. In addition to installing Wi-Fi networks and expanding mobile internet access to public housing communities in all five boroughs, the Administration has committed $70 million for broadband infrastructure investments over the next 10 years. The Mayor recently announced the appointment of Miguel A. Gamiño Jr. as the City's Chief Technology Officer (http://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/843-16/mayor-de-blasio-appoints-miguel-a-gamino-jr-nyc-chief-technology-officer) to lead the City's Broadband Program, building on previous high-level appointments (http://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/226-15/de-blasio-administration-escalates-efforts-close-digital-divide-drive-down-cost-internet).
As part of the City's commitment to expanding broadband access for all New Yorkers, the de Blasio Administration has implemented LinkNYC, the world's largest and fastest municipal Wi-Fi network; expanded the City's library hotspot program to lend Wi-Fi devices to families of public school students; and launched an initiative to deliver free broadband service to 21,000 NYCHA residents. All of these initiatives advance the City's broader goal of achieving universal affordable high-speed internet access by 2025.
""Access to the internet is no longer a luxury, but an essential utility that families and children need to succeed professionally and academically, and to carry out basic daily chores. Unfortunately, the continued digital divide shows that for too many, this necessity is out of reach. This public-private initiative will help thousands of Bronx children and adolescents that have no internet at home to learn and to thrive by opening new horizons and filling an important gap in their skill set,"" said Congressman Jose Serrano.
""In our connected world and globalized economy, it is imperative that families, and students in particular, are skilled in using technology and are connected to the Internet. This investment will not only help bridge the digital divide among families living in public housing, it will give them a necessary tool that can help with economic and career opportunities. When the federal government invests in public housing residents, it helps lift up families and communities,"" said Council Member Ritchie Torres, Chair of the Committee on Public Housing."
12/20/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-194.cfm,HUD Awards Nearly $2 Billion for Local Homeless Programs,"WASHINGTON - As part of the Obama Administration's effort to prevent and end homelessness, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today awarded a record $1.95 billion in grants to nearly 7,600 homeless assistance programs across throughout the nation, including Puerto Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. HUD's Continuum of Care grants provide critically needed support to local programs on the front lines of serving individuals and families experiencing homelessness. View a complete list of all the state and local homeless projects awarded funding on HUD's website.
This year, HUD continued to challenge state and local planning organizations called ""Continuums of Care"" to support their highest performing local programs that have proven most effective in meeting the needs of persons experiencing homelessness in their communities. Many of these state and local planners also embraced HUD's call to shift funds from existing underperforming projects to create new ones that are based on best practices that will further their efforts to prevent and end homelessness.
""Todaymarks another critical investment in support of those working each and every day to house and serve our most vulnerable neighbors,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""We know how to end homelessness and will continue to encourage our local partners to use the latest evidence to achieve success. These grants support proven strategies to end homelessness once and for all.""
""Continuums of Care across the nation are acting with urgency and resolve, with a focus on using federal resources as effectively and efficiently as possible,"" said Matthew Doherty, executive director of the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness. ""The investments being made through these grants are absolutely critical to sustaining and building upon the progress communities are making toward ending homelessness.""
In 2010, President Obama and 19 federal agencies and offices that form the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH) launched the nation's first-ever comprehensive strategy to prevent and end homelessness. Opening Doors: Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness (http://www.usich.gov/opening_doors/) puts the country on a path to end veterans and chronic homelessness as well as to end homelessness among children, family, and youth.
Each year, more than one million people experiencing homelessness are provided emergency, transitional, and permanent housing. The Department estimates there were 549,928 persons experiencing homelessness on a single night in 2016. Since the launch of Opening Doors in 2010, local communities around the country report:
The total number of individuals experiencing homelessness declined by 14 percent; Veteran homelessness fell by 47 percent; Chronic homelessness declined 27 percent; and Family homelessness declined by nearly 23 percent.
• The total number of individuals experiencing homelessness declined by 14 percent;
• Veteran homelessness fell by 47 percent;
• Chronic homelessness declined 27 percent; and
• Family homelessness declined by nearly 23 percent.
HUD has launched a robust effort to more accurately account for the youth and young adult population in the nation's next count slated for next month. Once local communities gather and report their 2017 data, HUD will issue a new national estimate in the Fall of 2017."
12/22/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-195.cfm,HUD and VA Announce Additional Funding to Help More Homeless Veterans in Rural Areas Find Permanent Homes,"WASHINGTON - In a continuing effort to help end veteran homelessness, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) today announce $2.9 million to local public housing agencies across the country to provide a permanent home to 529 veterans and their families who are experiencing homelessness in rural areas (see attached list below).
The supportive housing assistance announced today is provided through the HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) Program which combines rental assistance from HUD with case management and clinical services provided by VA. See local funding chart below. This year, HUD awarded approximately $60 million to support more than 8,000 veterans and their families. HUD-VASH ensures that veterans experiencing homelessness receive both the housing and services to live stably in their own homes.
""Homelessness is not unique to our big cities so as we work to end veteran homelessness, we must reach out to those vets living in rural areas as well,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""As a top priority of this Administration, we've dramatically reduced veteran homelessness in this country because we have a clear responsibility to serve those who served our nation.""
""As a nation, we rightly made a commitment to help Veterans exit homelessness regardless of the communities where they settle after military service,"" said VA Secretary Robert A. McDonald. ""We have followed through on that commitment by reducing Veteran homelessness nearly in half nationwide. But much of that progress has come in urban areas so the HUD-VASH awards announced today, which benefit more than 40 rural communities where affordable housing is scarce, are a necessary step in the vital work of taking care of the women and men who bravely served us all.""
Since 2010, the Obama Administration and 19 federal agencies and offices that form the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH) launched the nation's first comprehensive strategy to prevent and end homelessness.Opening Doors: Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness (http://www.usich.gov/opening_doors/) serves as a roadmap for how the federal government will work with state and local communities to confront the root causes of homelessness, especially among former servicemen and women.
More than 87,000 vouchers have been awarded and over 120,000 homeless veterans have been served through the HUD-VASH program since 2008. Rental assistance and supportive services provided through HUD-VASH are a critical resource for local communities in ending homelessness among our nation's veterans.
In the HUD-VASH program, VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) assess veterans experiencing homelessness before referring them to local housing agencies for these vouchers. Decisions are based on a variety of factors, most importantly the duration of homelessness and the need for longer term, more intensive support in obtaining and maintaining permanent housing. The HUD-VASH program includes both the rental assistance the voucher provides and the comprehensive case management that VAMC staff offers.
Veterans participating in the HUD-VASH program rent privately owned housing and generally contribute no more than 30 percent of their income toward rent. VA offers eligible homeless veterans clinical and supportive services through its medical centers across the U.S., Guam, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands."
12/22/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-198.cfm,HUD Approves Fair Housing Agreements Between Wyoming Landlords and Families Claiming Discrimination,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today two agreements between the owners and managers of Plainview Mobile Home Park in Casper, Wyoming, and two families who complained they were unlawfully denied the reasonable modifications they needed. Read the Conciliation Agreements here and here.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from denying or limiting housing to people with disabilities, or from refusing to make reasonable modifications which may be necessary to afford people with disabilities full enjoyment of a premises.
""Landlords are required to make reasonable modifications to their units that allow residents with disabilities to fully use and enjoy the place they call home,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Today's agreement will remind housing providers of the importance of complying with their obligations under the Fair Housing Act.""
The cases came to HUD'S attention when the Wyoming families filed complaints alleging thatRHP Properties, Inc., located in Farmington Hills, Michigan, the company's owner, and its former regional manager denied their requests of reasonable modifications needed by members of their families. Specifically, the families claimed that RHP Properties denied their requests to erect chain-link fences around their yards so that their children, who are deaf or hard of hearing, could play in a controlled environment.
RHP is the largest mobile home park owner/manager in the nation, controlling more than 60,000 rental lots in 28 states.
Under the two agreements, RHP agreed to provide monetary relief, grant the families permission to erect and maintain chain-link fences, and purchase and install ""Deaf Child at Play"" signs at designated locations throughout the mobile home park. RHP also agreed to adopt reasonable accommodation and reasonable modification policies that are consistent with the Fair Housing Act, give copies of the policies to all new tenants applying to live at any of the properties they own and/or manage, and post fair housing posters in the rental offices for those properties.
Disability is the most common basis of complaint filed with HUD and its partner agencies. Last year alone, HUD considered more than 4,500 disability-related complaints or nearly 55 percent of all fair housing complaints.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to www.hud.gov/fairhousing, or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, which can be accessed through Apple and Android devices."
12/22/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-199.cfm,HUD Approves Agreement with Las Vegas Landlords to Resolve Housing Discrimination Complaints,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today it approved an agreement between the owners and managers of Maycliff Mobile Home Park in Las Vegas, Nevada, and a family to resolve allegations that the landlords refused to allow an elderly woman's son and his pregnant wife to live at the property after their child was born. The property improperly claimed to be housing for older persons. Read the conciliation agreement.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from denying or limiting housing to families with children, including pregnant women. Housing providers may exclude families with children under the age of 18 if the property meets the requirements to qualify as senior housing under the Housing for Older Persons Act of 1995.
""Landlords and property owners have an obligation to treat every applicant the same, including pregnant women and families with young children,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Housing providers may not exclude pregnant women and children under 18 unless the housing meets all requirements for exempt housing for older persons.""
In order to qualify for the ""housing for older persons"" exemption, a facility or community operating as housing for persons who are 55 years of age or older must satisfy each of the following requirements:
At least 80 percent of the occupied units must have at least one occupant who is 55 years of age or older; The facility or community must publish and adhere to policies and procedures that demonstrate the intent to operate as ""55 or older"" housing; and The facility or community must comply with HUD's regulatory requirements for age verification of residents.
• At least 80 percent of the occupied units must have at least one occupant who is 55 years of age or older;
• The facility or community must publish and adhere to policies and procedures that demonstrate the intent to operate as ""55 or older"" housing; and
• The facility or community must comply with HUD's regulatory requirements for age verification of residents.
The case came to HUD's attention when a female resident of the mobile home park filed a complaint alleging that the owners and managers of the property required her son and daughter-in-law, who were also her live-in caretakers, to vacate the property after they found out that her daughter-in-law was pregnant.
Under the conciliation agreement, the owner and managers will pay the elderly woman $15,000, and will ensure compliance with the Fair Housing Act and HUD's regulations. The owners and managers will also obtain fair housing training.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY).

The funding, provided through HUD's Resident Opportunities and Self Sufficiency - Service Coordinators Program (ROSS-SC) helps grantees hire or retain ""service coordinators"" who work directly with residents to assess their needs and connect them with education, job training and placement programs, and/or computer and financial literacy services available in their community to promote self-sufficiency.
""Helping public housing residents find decent jobs that pay a living wage is the surest path to opportunity and self-sufficiency,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""This funding provides our local partners with the resources to help more Americans build a brighter future for themselves and their children.""
The purpose of HUD's ROSS-SC program is to encourage innovative and locally driven strategies that link public housing assistance with public and private resources to enable participating families increase earned income; reduce or eliminate the need for welfare assistance; and make progress toward achieving economic independence and housing self-sufficiency."
12/23/2016:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2016/pr16-197.cfm,HUD Awards Additional $1.8 Billion to Help Six States to Recover from 2016 Disasters,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Julián Castro today awarded an additional $1.8 billion to help Louisiana, West Virginia, Texas, North Carolina, South Carolina and Florida to recover after severe flooding events that occurred earlier this year. Provided through HUD's Community Development Block Grant - Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) Program, these recovery funds will assist the most impacted communities that experienced the most serious damage to their housing stock.
President Obama signed the Fiscal Year 2017 Further Continuing Resolution into law on December 10, 2016. This stopgap spending measure directed HUD to allocate $1.8 billion ""in the most impacted and distressed areas"" that experienced presidentially declared disasters in 2016 but prior to December 10, 2016, including Hurricanes Matthew and Hermine. The disaster recovery grants announced today are in addition to $500 million HUD allocated in October (see chart below).
""Our team worked quickly to make sure these funds reach the communities most impacted by a major disaster this year."" said Secretary Castro. ""We'll do everything we can to support the people and places still struggling to rebuild.""
HUD awarded the following disaster recovery funds based on each state's proportional share of serious unmet housing and infrastructure needs:
* Disaster declarations due to Hurricane Matthew ** Disaster declarations due to Hurricane Hermine
To determine these disaster recovery allocations, HUD analyzes the most currently available data of the unmet costs to repair seriously damaged properties and infrastructure in the most-impacted counties. HUD will shortly publish a notice in the Federal Register which will define the criteria for the use of these funds. CDBG-Disaster Recovery grants can support a wide variety of activities including housing redevelopment, business assistance and infrastructure repair."

EXPLANATORY NOTES
These statistics are estimated from sample surveys. They are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated average relative standard errors of the preliminary data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2%) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90-percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. Changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show irregular movement. It takes 3 months to establish a trend for new houses sold. Preliminary new home sales figures are subject to revision due to the survey methodology and definitions used. The survey is primarily based on a sample of houses selected from building permits. Since a ""sale"" is defined as a deposit taken or sales agreement signed, this can occur prior to a permit being issued. An estimate of these prior sales is included in the sales figure. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimate of total sales is revised about 4 percent. Changes in sales price data reflect changes in the distribution of houses by region, size, etc., as well as changes in the prices of houses with identical characteristics. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found on our web site listed above.
* 90% confidence interval includes zero. The Census Bureau does not have sufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero."
