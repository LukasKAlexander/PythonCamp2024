01/07/2020:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2020/pr20-002.cfm,HUD Issues Improved Fair Housing Rule,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today published its proposed Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing (AFFH) rule, which offers clearer guidance to states and local governments to help them improve affordable housing choices in their community. Read HUD's proposed rule.
""HUD's commitment to Fair Housing remains as steadfast as ever before, and this improved rule reaffirms our mission of giving people more affordable housing options in communities across the country,"" said Secretary Carson. ""By fixing the old Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing rule, localities now have the flexibility to devise housing plans that fit their unique needs and provide families with more housing choices within their reach.""
""Mayors know their communities best, so we are empowering them to make housing decisions that meet their unique needs, not a mandate from the federal government,"" continued Carson. ""Having said that, if a community fails to improve housing choice, HUD stands ready to enforce the Fair Housing Act and pursue action against any party that violates the law.""
Background
On July 16, 2015, HUD published its final AFFH rule. The stated purpose of that regulation was to provide HUD program participants with a revised planning approach to assist them in meeting their legal obligation to affirmatively further fair housing. Since then, HUD found that in contrast to its stated goals, the AFFH rule proved ineffective, highly prescriptive, and effectively discouraged the production of affordable housing.
In January 2018, HUD suspended the obligation of local governments to file plans under the regulation and, in May 2018, withdrew a computer assessment tool required to be used by local governments in preparing those plans. HUD found that rather than assisting local governments in formulating acceptable fair housing assessments, the 'Local Government Assessment Tool' was confusing, difficult to use, contained errors, and frequently produced unacceptable assessments. Litigation challenging HUD's actions was dismissed.
After reviewing public comments and holding listening sessions across the country, HUD is proposing an improved AFFH rule so it can be used by communities to promote more fair housing options."
01/07/2020:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2020/pr20-003.cfm,HUD Releases 2019 Annual Homeless Assessment Report,"WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) released its 2019 Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress (www.hudexchange.info/resource/5948/2019-ahar-part-1-pit-estimates-of-homelessness-in-the-us). The report certified last month by HUD Secretary Ben Carson, found that 567,715 persons experienced homelessness on a single night in 2019, an increase of 14,885 people since 2018. Meanwhile, homelessness among veterans and families with children continued to fall, declining 2.1 percent and 4.8 percent, respectively, in 2019.
There is significant local variation reported from different parts of the country. Twenty-nine states and the District of Columbia reported declines in homelessness between 2018 and 2019, while 21 states reported increases in the number of persons experiencing homelessness. Homelessness in California increased by 21,306 people, or 16.4 percent, which is more than the total national increase of every other state combined.
""The Trump Administration is committed to working with local communities to find effective ways to end homelessness,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""HUD will continue these efforts to help end the suffering of our most vulnerable neighbors in the most compassionate way possible."" ""As we look across our nation, we see great progress, but we're also seeing a continued increase in street homelessness along our West Coast where the cost of housing is extremely high,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""In fact, homelessness in California is at a crisis level and needs to be addressed by local and state leaders with crisis-like urgency. Addressing these challenges will require a broader, community-wide response that engages every level of government to compassionately house our most vulnerable fellow citizens.""
HUD's national estimate is based upon data reported by approximately 3,000 cities and counties across the nation. Every year on a single night in January, planning agencies called ""Continuums of Care,"" (COC) along with tens of thousands of volunteers, seek to identify the number of individuals and families living in emergency shelters, transitional housing programs, and in unsheltered settings. These one-night 'snapshot' counts, as well as full-year counts and data from other sources (U.S. Housing Survey, Department of Education), are crucial in understanding the scope of homelessness and measuring progress toward reducing it.
Key Findings
On a single night in January 2019, state and local planning agencies (Continuums of Care) reported:
567,715 people were homeless, representing an overall 2.7 percent increase from 2018 but a nearly 11 percent decline since 2010. 37,085 Veterans were reported as homeless, a decline of 2.1 percent from 2018 and 50 percent since 2010. 53,692 families with children experienced homelessness last January, down nearly 5 percent from 2018 and more than 32 percent since 2010. Homelessness increased in California by 21,306 people, or 16.4 percent, accounting for more than the entire national increase. The estimated number of persons experiencing long-term, chronic homelessness increased 8.5 percent between 2018 and 2019. This increase was concentrated on the West Coast, with the largest increases in California. The number of unaccompanied homeless youth and children in 2019 is estimated to be 35,038, a 3.6 percent decline since 2018.

This increase was concentrated on the West Coast, with the largest increases in California. The number of unaccompanied homeless youth and children in 2019 is estimated to be 35,038, a 3.6 percent decline since 2018.
Homelessness in California California reported a large increase of 21,306 persons experiencing homelessness, or 16.4 percent. Last year's increases are particularly noteworthy among unsheltered individuals and the chronically homeless.
Veteran Homelessness Homelessness among Veterans is half of what was reported in 2010. Last year alone, the number of veterans experiencing homelessness declined by 2.1 percent. These declines are the result of intense planning and targeted interventions, including the close collaboration between HUD and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Both agencies jointly administer the HUD-VA Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) Program, which combines permanent HUD rental assistance with case management and clinical services provided by the VA. This year, more than 4,400 veterans, many experiencing chronic forms of homelessness, will find permanent housing and critically needed support services through the HUD-VASH program. An additional 50,000 veterans found permanent housing and supportive services through VA's continuum of homeless programs.
Family Homelessness Local communities continue to report declines in homelessness among families with children in the U.S. In January of 2019, there were 53,692 family households with children experiencing homelessness, a decline of five percent between 2018 and 2019, and 32 percent between 2007 and 2019. Following HUD's guidance and data-driven evidence and best practices, local planners are increasingly relying upon interventions to move families into permanent housing more quickly and at lower cost. Communities are using more robust coordinated entry efforts, which have proven to be an effective response in helping families experiencing temporary crises as well as those enduring the most chronic forms of homelessness.
Chronic Homelessness Long-term or chronic homelessness among individuals with disabilities grew 8.5 percent since 2018, while falling 9.4 percent below the levels reported in 2010. This longer trend is due in large measure to more permanent supportive housing opportunities available for people with disabling health conditions who otherwise continually cycle through local shelters or the streets."
01/13/2020:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2020/pr20-005.cfm,HUD Launches Building Home Online Training,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today launched the new Building HOME online training series (https://www.hudexchange.info/trainings/building-home) for the HOME Investment Partnerships (HOME) Program.
Building HOME online training is an interactive, self-paced online training which guides grantees through 12 modules, providing a foundation of the regulatory requirements of the program and practical advice for implementing all HOME activities at the state and local levels. The training presents real-world scenarios and includes challenge questions and exams.
Building HOME online training will be an important resource for new and existing grantee staff, which includes states and local governments and partners working with HOME funds. Newcomers to the HOME Program can work through each module to get a comprehensive understanding of the program, while current practitioners can use the online training to get tips on program implementation for each of the key HOME activities.
This initial launch includes 8 of the 12 training modules. Four additional modules will be launched in the next few months to complete the Building HOME online training series. Participants should register for the HUD Exchange mailing list *https://icfi.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=87d7c8afc03ba69ee70d865b9&id=f32b935a5f) to be notified when the new modules are launched and access the most up to date information related to the program.
The HOME program provides formula grants to states and localities that communities use in partnership with local nonprofit groups to fund a wide range of affordable housing activities. This includes building, buying, or rehabilitating affordable housing for rent or homeownership. HOME also provides direct rental assistance to low-income people. It's the largest federal block grant to state and local governments designed exclusively to create affordable housing for low-income households."
01/14/2020:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2020/pr20-004.cfm,"HUD Awards Nearly $500,000 to Public Housing Authorities to Help Young People Aging Out of Foster Care","WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson today awarded $482,000 to four housing authorities to assist young people aging out of foster care and who are at risk of experiencing homelessness. See chart below.
Secretary Ben Carson made the announcement during an interview with Jericka Duncan on CBS This Morning (www.cbsnews.com/video/new-federal-program-helps-young-adults-aging-out-of-foster-care).
Funded through HUD's new Foster Youth to Independence (FYI) Initiative, this funding will offer housing vouchers to local public housing authorities to prevent or end homelessness among young adults under the age of 25 who are, or have recently left, the foster care system without a home to go to. FYI requires that communities provide supportive services for the length of assistance to help youth achieve self-sufficiency. These activities center around basic life skills, landlord outreach and job preparation. Additionally, they will receive educational and career counseling, as well as counseling on program and lease compliance. These supportive services are critical given that the assistance is time limited.
""HUD wants to lend a helping hand to young people by ensuring they have a smooth transition when leaving the foster care system to branch out on their own,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""With assistance from local housing authorities, today's funding helps keep young people off the streets and prevents them from becoming homeless and gives them the tools they need for a new beginning.""
R. Hunter Kurtz, Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing added: ""Giving someone a place to call home is at the core of HUD's mission. HUD is proud to work with these local housing authorities to help young people leaving foster care get into a place they call their own.""
Additionally, HUD is in the process of awarding another 32 vouchers to eligible participants before the end of the month.
These tenant-protection vouchers will go to public housing authorities that do not participate in HUD's Family Unification Program. The public housing authorities must:
Administer a Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) Program; Enter into a partnership agreement with a Public Child Welfare Agency (PCWA); Accept young people referred by their partnering PCWA; and Determine that the referred youth are eligible for HCV assistance.
• Administer a Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) Program;
• Enter into a partnership agreement with a Public Child Welfare Agency (PCWA);
• Accept young people referred by their partnering PCWA; and
• Determine that the referred youth are eligible for HCV assistance.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) estimates that more than 20,000 young people age out of foster care each year. The National Center for Housing and Child Welfare (NCHCW) estimates that approximately 25 percent of these young people experience homelessness within four years of leaving foster care and an even higher share are precariously housed."
01/14/2020:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2020/pr20-006.cfm,HUD Awards Nearly $2.2 Billion to Local Homeless Programs,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson today announced nearly $2.2 billion in grants to support thousands of local homeless assistance programs across the nation. HUD's Continuum of Care grants will provide critically needed support to approximately 6,593 local programs on the front lines, serving individuals and families experiencing homelessness. This is the first of two announcements of Continuum of Care awards. View a complete list of all the state and local homeless projects awarded funding (www.hudexchange.info/programs/coc/awards).
""A safe, affordable place to call home is key when creating a path toward opportunity and self-sufficiency,"" said Secretary Carson in Ohio, where he made the funding announcement. ""The grants awarded today help our partners on the ground to reduce homelessness in their communities and help our most vulnerable neighbors.""
HUD Continuum of Care grant funding supports a broad array of interventions designed to assist individuals and families experiencing homelessness, particularly those living in places not meant for habitation, located in sheltering programs, or at imminent risk of becoming homeless. Each year, HUD serves more than a million people through emergency shelter, transitional, and permanent housing programs.
HUD continues to challenge state and local planning organizations called ""Continuums of Care"" to support their highest performing local programs that have proven most effective in meeting the needs of persons experiencing homelessness in their communities.
In 2019, most of the country experienced a combined decrease in homelessness but significant increases in unsheltered and chronic homelessness on the West Coast, particularly California and Oregon, offset those nationwide decreases, causing an overall increase in homelessness of 2.7 percent. HUD's 2019 Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress (www.hudexchange.info/resource/5948/2019-ahar-part-1-pit-estimates-of-homelessness-in-the-us/) found that 567,715 persons experienced homelessness on a single night in 2019, an increase of 2.7 percent since 2018 but nearly 11 percent decline since 2010. The number of families with children experiencing homelessness declined 5 percent from 2018 and more than 32 percent since 2010. Local communities also reported a continuing trend in reducing veteran homelessness across the country—the number of veterans experiencing homelessness fell 2.1 percent since January 2018 and by 50 percent since 2010.

Couch as the Federal Financial Monitor to oversee the grant administration and disbursement process of disaster recovery funds to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
""We are glad to have Robert re-join our Department to manage our financial oversight operations in Puerto Rico,"" said Secretary Carson.

""I greatly appreciate the Secretary's confidence in me,"" said Robert Couch. ""I share his dedication to the recovery from Hurricanes Irma and Maria, and his determination to ensuring that the funds entrusted to HUD by Congress for the survivors are expended as quickly as possible while still safeguarding against waste, fraud and abuse. I look forward to working with the disaster recovery teams in both locales, and I thank Olga Castellón, the Acting FFM, for paving the way so I can hit the ground running.""
Mr. Couch will join HUD as a career member of the Senior Executive Service. He previously served as HUD's General Counsel from December 2006 to November 2008 where he acted as the chief legal advisor to the Secretary, Deputy Secretary, and other principal staff, providing advice on federal laws, regulations, and policies affecting HUD programs. Mr. Couch also served as President of the Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae), Commissioner on the Bipartisan Policy Center's Housing Commission, and as a member of President George W.

01/17/2020:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2020/pr20-009.cfm,HUD Proposes New Rule Recognizing Additional Building Codes and Standards to Encourage More Housing Development,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced a proposed rule (https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2020-00233.pdf) that would recognize additional sets of standards and model building code editions that, when followed in the design and construction of new multifamily housing, will ensure compliance with the accessibility requirements of the Fair Housing Act.
""HUD is committed to supporting states, local communities, and the housing industry at large, in their efforts to build housing that is accessible to persons with disabilities,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""HUD is happy to propose these additional safe harbors as a way to further encourage the development of housing that is open to all.""
Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity added: ""Adopting a model building code that HUD recognizes as a safe harbor is one very powerful way for states and local governments to deliver housing opportunities to people with disabilities. With the recognition of these additional safe harbors under our proposed rule, it will be easier than ever for states and local governments to step up to the plate and do their part to support people in their communities who need homes with accessible features.""
The Fair Housing Act requires that multifamily housing built after March 1991 contain accessible features for people with disabilities. Requirements include accessible common areas in buildings and developments, usable bathrooms and kitchens, wider doors, and environmental controls that can be reached by persons who use wheelchairs. The failure to include these features in buildings constructed after March 1991 violates federal law and makes a property difficult or impossible for persons with disabilities to use.
Under the proposed rule (https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2020-00233.pdf), HUD will incorporate more recent editions of currently recognized safe harbor standards and model building codes. HUD will amend its regulations to include the 2009 edition standards of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), as well as the 2009, 2012, 2015, and 2018 editions of the International Building Code, as safe harbors for compliance with the accessibility requirements of the Fair Housing Act.
States and local communities across the nation often adopt or adapt model building codes for enforcement within their jurisdictions to ensure up-to-date, sound standards for construction. When fully adopting one of HUD's ""safe harbors,"" state and local communities are assured that their building codes incorporate the requirements for accessible features in new multifamily housing buildings under the Fair Housing Act.
""Designers and builders of multifamily housing developments have an obligation to comply with the Fair Housing Act, particularly as it relates to accessibility,"" said Paul Compton, HUD's General Counsel. ""The rule we are proposing will greatly assist them in meeting that requirement while giving state and local governments the opportunity to reduce regulatory burdens that can arise when federal, state, and local laws differ.""

EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take three months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, six months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2 percent) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percentage change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percentage changes are 90 percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percentage changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised 3 percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at the Census Bureau's website (www.census.gov/construction/nrc/how_the_data_are_collected/index.html).
* The 90 percent confidence interval includes zero. In such cases, there is insufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero."

Shortly after, Secretary Carson unveiled a HUD pilot program to give procurement preference to small businesses whose principal office is in an Opportunity Zone.
Innovative Housing Showcase
""The Innovative Housing Showcase, like this week's International Builders' Show, illustrates that the future belongs to the American builder."" - Secretary Ben Carson
The Innovative Housing Showcase will be held on the National Mall September 12-14, 2020, to educate policy makers and the broader public on the new housing innovations and building technologies that are helping address the affordable housing challenges across our country.
""We're thrilled to partner with the National Association of Home Builders for a second year to bring this Showcase to the National Mall,"" said Secretary Ben Carson. ""It's important we highlight these new building technologies that are answering the call for more affordable, durable housing options for families across America.""
""The housing affordability crisis is affecting both builders and consumers nationwide. We are honored to be co-hosting this event with HUD as we work together to find solutions to this growing problem,"" said Dean Mon, chairman of the National Association of Home Builders.
The Showcase will highlight various solutions that could make housing more affordable for American families and more resilient during natural disasters. For more information, please visit www.hud.gov/Innovative_Housing.
Pilot Program in Opportunity Zones
""Through this procurement pilot, HUD will continue to lead the way in coordinating federal resources to Opportunity Zones across the country."" - Secretary Ben Carson
The pilot applies to procurement at or below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT), currently $250,000.00, and typically set aside for small businesses. The pilot began on January 1 and will run through June 30, 2020.
""I am pleased to announce the launch of this procurement pilot,"" Secretary Ben Carson said. ""HUD will continue to lead the way in coordinating Federal resources to Opportunity Zones across the country. Working together, we are bringing lasting change to the communities that need it most.""
""Facilitating small business activity and growth is an integral part the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council. This announcement is another positive step that HUD is taking to ensure that our nation's Opportunity Zones are on the path to revitalization."" said Scott Turner, who serves as Executive Director of the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council.
The Office of the Chief Procurement Officer will add specific language to describe the preference in upcoming solicitations that will be included in the pilot. As measurement of efficacy represents a key component of the Opportunity Zones initiative, HUD will review the results and determine next steps after the pilot is completed.
Ron Flom, HUD's Chief Procurement Officer, added, ""We are happy to support Secretary Carson's Opportunity Zone initiatives with this pilot program to give preference to small businesses located in Opportunity Zones. This also supports the Department's Small Business Program, and this will be a win-win for both HUD and small businesses in Opportunity Zones.""

01/28/2020:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2020/pr20-013.cfm,HUD Issues Guidance on Reasonable Accommodations Under the Fair Housing Act Relating to Assistance Animals,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced the publication of guidance clarifying how housing providers can comply with the Fair Housing Act when assessing a person's request to have an animal in housing to provide assistance because of a disability.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in housing against individuals who have disabilities that affect a major life activity. The Act requires housing providers to permit a change or exception to a rule, policy, practice, or service that may be necessary to provide people with disabilities that affect a major life activity an equal opportunity to use and enjoy their home. In most circumstances, a refusal to make such a change or exception, known as a reasonable accommodation, is unlawful. A common reasonable accommodation is an exception to a no pet policy. A person with a disability that affects a major life activity may require the assistance of an animal that does work, performs tasks, or provides therapeutic emotional support because of the disability. Housing providers may confirm, if it is not apparent, whether the requested accommodation is needed because of a disability that affects a major life activity and is a reasonable request.
This new Assistance Animal Notice will help housing providers in this process by offering a step-by-step set of best practices for complying with the Act when assessing accommodation requests involving animals and information that a person may need to provide about his or her disability-related need for the requested accommodation, including supporting information from a health care professional. Read the Notice.
""Countless Americans rely on assistance animals to fill a void, providing individuals with disabilities with the means to have a home that supports their quality of life,"" stated Secretary Ben Carson. ""In my many discussions with housing providers and residents impacted by the need for assistance, I recognized the necessity for further clarity regarding support animals to provide peace of mind to individuals with disabilities while also taking in account the concerns of housing providers. Today's announcement responds to the ambiguity surrounding proper documentation for assistance animals with clarity and compassion to provide an equal opportunity for a person living with a disability to use and enjoy their home.""
""For decades, HUD has recognized the rights of individuals with disabilities to keep an assistance animal in the home where it is a reasonable accommodation,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Housing is unique, and a person with a disability that affects a major life activity might need an animal that provides support in ways that is not readily apparent to housing providers. For example, veterans or senior citizens may need the assistance or therapeutic support of an animal to help them cope with the symptoms of a disability that affects a major life activity. This guidance will help housing providers to recognize the important way assistance animals can improve the lives of persons with disabilities and to meet their obligation to grant such accommodations.""
HUD General Counsel Paul Compton added, ""With the Assistance Animals Notice, both housing providers and individuals with disabilities will better understand their rights and obligations under the Fair Housing Act regarding assistance animals, particularly emotional support animals. For housing providers, this is a tool that can be used to help them lawfully navigate various sets of sometimes complex circumstances to ensure that reasonable accommodations are provided where required so that persons with a disability-related need for an assistance animal have an equal opportunity to use and enjoy their housing. The guidance will help ensure that these important legal rights are asserted only in appropriate circumstances.""
Additionally, this new Assistance Animal Notice provides information on the types of animals that typically may be appropriate and best practices for when the requested animal is one that is not traditionally kept in the home. It also provides information for both housing providers and persons with disabilities regarding the reliability of documentation of a disability or disability-related need for an animal that is obtained from third parties, including internet-based services offering animal certifications or registrations for purchase.
Because they apply to more types of facilities than housing, the laws applicable to public accommodations and government funded facilities, including Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, while sometimes overlapping with the Fair Housing Act, have different, and sometimes narrower, requirements. Similarly, public transportation and common carriers, such as airlines, are also subject to different rules. The Assistance Animal Notice does not address those circumstances.
Persons who believe they have experienced housing discrimination may file a complaint of discrimination by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 or visiting How to File a Complaint on HUD's website."

01/30/2020:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2020/pr20-016.cfm,"During Bus Tour, Secretary Ben Carson Cuts Federal Barriers to Manufactured Housing","RUSSELLVILLE, AL - During a visit to Clayton Homes as part of the ""Driving Affordable Housing Across America Bus Tour,"" U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson announced a final rule (www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2020-01-31/pdf/2020-01474.pdf) on formaldehyde emissions for manufactured homes, and a proposed rule (www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2020-01-31/pdf/2020-01473.pdf) to revise the federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards to expedite construction and update safety requirements for carbon monoxide detectors in manufactured housing.
""The nation's affordable housing crisis can't be solved by one measure alone, but today we're proposing changes that remove more of the red tape that stands between the production of safe, quality homes, and the nation's families and individuals that need these homes to make homeownership a reality,"" said Secretary Carson. ""This proposal is a strong example of how we believe we can both reduce regulation and improve safety and security for the nation's homebuyers. Thank you to the entire Clayton Homes team for facilitating an informative discussion on the new building technologies and materials used in manufactured housing today.""
Specifically, HUD is recommending (www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2020-01-31/pdf/2020-01473.pdf) updates to modernize code provisions and allow for more optimal use of manufactured housing in urban areas, including Opportunity Zones; additional requirements for the installation of carbon monoxide alarms or detectors; and additional provisions for homes designed for structures attached at the site, including garages and carports. HUD's final rule (www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2020-01-31/pdf/2020-01474.pdf) on formaldehyde emissions for manufactured homes aligns HUD's regulations with other federal guidelines.
HUD's Office of Manufactured Housing Programs, part of HUD's Office of Housing, oversees the construction statutes, standards, and regulations of manufactured housing contained in the federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards. Manufactured housing provides nearly 10 percent of the total single-family housing stock, giving more than 22 million Americans a place to call home.
""I appreciate Secretary Carson touring the great work of Clayton, one of Alabama's finest,"" said Governor Kay Ivey. ""I applaud him and the Trump Administration for being laser-focused on removing burdensome regulations of big government and making home ownership an easier possibility for Alabama's families.""
""We are proud to support Secretary Carson's efforts to address the lack of affordable housing for American families,"" said Kevin Clayton, CEO of Clayton. ""Building indoors in a climate-controlled environment helps improve quality, purchasing power and efficiency, resulting in more value to the home buyer. Today Secretary Carson toured our home building facility and a new CrossMod home that incorporates a higher pitch roof, masonry foundation and other high-end features that typically are not within reach of someone seeking an affordable home. The CrossMod is an industry initiative that was designed to make homeownership more attainable.""
""MHI commends Secretary Carson for his leadership in updating the HUD Code, aligning HUD formaldehyde regulations with EPA guidelines, and working to alleviate regulatory barriers to manufactured housing at all levels of government,"" said Lesli Gooch, CEO of the Manufactured Housing Institute. ""Keeping the manufactured housing construction code up to date is critical for ensuring the industry can efficiently produce homes with innovative features and amenities consumers want. We appreciate Secretary Carson's support and for recognizing the quality, value and affordability that manufactured homes offer.""
HUD launched the ""Driving Affordable Housing Across America Bus Tour"" this week and will make stops in various local communities for events and discussions focused on the need for increased affordable housing.

""Expanding affordable housing opportunities is a priority, especially for our nation's most vulnerable populations,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""These awards will facilitate capital investment in senior housing developments and create roughly 1,100 new homes, the majority for very low-income seniors.""
""The combination of Capital Advance and Project Rental Assistance grants creates greater supply of new rental units and supports the viability of existing properties,"" said Federal Housing Commissioner Brian Montgomery.
Requiring leverage with other sources of private capital, HUD has significantly reduced the reliance on federal investment for the development of these properties-$88,000 per unit today compared to $156,000 per unit in 2012-the last time HUD made Section 202 construction/ rehabilitation grant awards.
Section 202 grants provide very low-income elderly persons 62 years of age or older with the opportunity to live independently in an environment that provides support services to meet their unique needs. HUD provides these funds to non-profit organizations in two forms:
Capital Advances. This is funding that covers the cost of developing, acquiring, or rehabilitating the development. Repayment is not required as long as the housing remains available for occupancy by very low-income elderly persons for at least 40 years. Project Rental Assistance Contracts (PRAC). This is project-based funding which covers the difference between residents' contributions toward rent and the cost of operating the project.

The FY21 budget seeks to provide the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) with $47.9 billion in funding to assist the fight to end homelessness, boost the promotion of healthy homes, and help America's low-income families pay rent.
""The President's budget proposal provides HUD with the resources to serve America's most vulnerable populations in an efficient and compassionate manner,"" said Secretary Carson. ""We must remember, compassion is not always how many people we can get on a government program, but rather how many people we can help graduate out of a program and into financial independence. The road to self-sufficiency is one that is sure to improve the lives of all Americans.""
The FY21 Budget continues a commitment to fiscal responsibility, targeting lower value HUD programs for elimination or reduction, while seeking stable or increased funding into the highest impact programs that provide housing and support for vulnerable populations, including:
$2.8 Billion to Assist the Fight to End Homelessness
To help communities across the nation end homelessness, the President has budgeted $2.8 billion. HUD will continue working with local and state governments to compassionately house their most vulnerable populations through grant funds for emergency shelters, rapid re-housing, and transitional and permanent supportive housing—all while providing people with key services to help them regain their independence.
Record $425 Million to Boost Healthy Homes
HUD remains committed to providing families with safe and healthy housing nationwide in FY2021. Recognizing that housing conditions directly affect the health of residents, the President is requesting $425 million to mitigate health and safety hazards through lead remediation, carbon monoxide detectors, and healthy home grants. This is a $90 million increase over the enacted level for 2020.
Providing $41.3 billion to Help Americans Pay Rent
Currently, more than 4.6 million low-income families pay their rent with federal support, and more than half a million people are living on our nation's streets. The President's Budget funds the Department's critical work to help our most vulnerable citizens secure housing so they can begin creating a better life for themselves. With $41.3 billion requested, the Budget supports the same number of rental-assisted households as were served last year while re-proposing a bold set of reforms to ensure the programs are sustainable for the future.
$190 Million to Pave the Path to Self-Sufficiency
The budget proposes $190 million that will directly support key initiatives like the Department's Family Self-Sufficiency Program, which has more than 70,000 active participant households and 5,409 graduates who no longer require temporary assistance, and more than half graduate with an average savings of $6,700. HUD's Jobs-Plus Program is geared toward increasing employment opportunities and earnings of public housing residents through a three-pronged approach of employment services, rent-based work incentives, and community support.
Through Jobs-Plus, nearly 1,500 individuals have been continuously employed for at least 180 days after placement, and residents have saved over $21.3 million in rent payments.
Supporting Housing Finance Reform
In FY2021, the Department reintroduced its plan for reforming the nation's housing finance system. The plan ensures the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA or Ginnie Mae) will continue to perform their important missions effectively, responsibly, and sustainably for many years to come.
Continuing to Build and Preserve Housing Supply
The 2021 President's Budget requests $100 million for the Office of Housing's Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) program. RAD is a powerful tool that gives public housing authorities (PHAs) the resources needed to preserve and improve public housing properties and address the nationwide backlog of deferred maintenance. Transitioning Public Housing units to a more sustainable platform is one of HUD's four Agency Priority Goals.
Protecting Taxpayer Dollars
HUD has established an Agency-Wide Integrity Task Force, that consists of the heads of HUD's program offices. HUD will strive to eliminate fraud, waste, and abuse of taxpayers' dollars as part of this strategic goal. In addition, the Department has developed and is implementing a five-year Financial Transformation Plan to protect taxpayers and support accountability, data, and transparency."

Promoting healthy homes that foster strong, vibrant communities and families has been a top priority for Secretary Carson throughout his time at HUD.
First launched in 2015, the HUD Secretary's Awards are presented annually to honor projects that exemplify excellence in five categories: affordable housing design, community planning, cooperative public/private efforts, healthy housing innovation, and historic preservation. The awards recognize projects that increase the quality of life for low- and moderate-income households.
HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes (OLHCHH) partners with the National Environmental Health Association (NEHA) in staging the national competition. Winners will be honored at NEHA's Annual Educational Conference and Exhibition (July 15, 2020) in New York City.
""Every day, our grantees, stakeholders, and partners are helping people in their communities to have safer and healthier lives,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""This award is a way to thank them and recognize all the great and impactful work they do.""

Secretary Carson met with San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer to discuss regulatory barriers to affordable housing and innovative ways the city is working to increase the area's housing supply.
Mayor Faulconer and Secretary Carson visited two affordable housing complexes in the city, Bluewater Apartments and The Stella. Both properties are managed by Affirmed Housing, a local developer of affordable housing, and provide a total of 160 apartments for formerly homeless residents, low-income individuals and families and those with special needs. Projects like the Stella and Bluewater complexes in San Diego's Grantville community have been able to be fast-tracked due to the City's push to update community plans and streamline project reviews for affordable housing. Following the tour, the Mayor and the Secretary co-hosted a roundtable discussion with community leaders about reducing regulatory barriers to affordable housing in the area.
Mayor Faulconer and Secretary Carson held a ""shred the reg"" ceremony during which they 'shredded' a regulation inhibiting the development of affordable housing.
""San Diego exemplifies the progress that can be made with communication and the realization of common goals across all levels of government,"" said Secretary Carson. ""As we continue to shred excessive regulatory barriers, like we did here today in San Diego, we will see an increase in affordable housing choices available to residents across the country.""
""The City of San Diego continues to implement the most forward-thinking housing reforms in California as we do our part to address the statewide housing crisis,"" Mayor Faulconer said. ""Projects like Stella are the culmination of those efforts to lower costs and speed up the construction of more affordable housing. We're excited to share our progress with Secretary Carson and how we plan to take our efforts to the next level this year.""
The ""Driving Affordable Housing Across America Bus Tour"" is a part of the work Secretary Carson is undertaking as the Chair of the White House Council on Eliminating Regulatory Barriers to Affordable Housing established in June 2019. The Council's eight Federal member agencies are engaging with governments at all levels-State, local, and Tribal-and private-sector and non-profit stakeholders on ways to increase our country's housing supply so more Americans have access to affordable housing.

Secretary Carson participated in a roundtable discussion about affordable housing and toured The Grove Village, which consists of four 600 square feet cottages on church property that have been renovated through business donations and volunteer efforts. The units house families who were at risk of homelessness.
""The power of the faith-based community can be seen here, through the united effort to care for our vulnerable neighbors and provide a safe place to call home in the Grove Village,"" Secretary Carson said. ""As California experiences a homeless crisis and rising housing prices, churches are on the frontlines as places of refuge for those who need it most. Thank you to these families for allowing me into their homes and to the Riverside Community for the compassion you have shown for all of God's people.""
""God has called us to love all people and not only to love but to care for the most vulnerable,"" said Tom Lance, Pastor Emeritus of Grove Church. ""The Grove is committed to ‘Bring God Glory' in all that we do and when churches and faith communities step out and do whatever they can to eliminate homelessness and care for all those involved we believe that brings God glory. We will do whatever we can to work with all those in Riverside who want to stand together and do what this great city has always done and that is ‘work together' and continue making Riverside a place where everyone feels welcome, safe and has hope for the future.""
""Secretary Carson and HUD are leading efforts to find innovative solutions to the housing and homeless crisis, and this led them to Riverside,"" said City of Riverside Mayor Rusty Bailey. ""We are proud to share the successes and the lessons learned from our first steps in the housing journey with the faith-based community. The Grove Village happened in spite of the regulatory barriers that are inhibiting affordable housing development, and this success cannot be repeated unless these barriers are broken down.""
During the roundtable discussion with faith and community leaders, Secretary Carson announced a new proposed rule (https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2020-02-13/pdf/2020-02495.pdf) issued by the Department that would eliminate burdensome requirements that unfairly imposed unique regulatory burdens only on religious organizations.

02/14/2020:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2020/pr20-028.cfm,"HUD Awards $2.7 Billion to Improve, Preserve Public Housing","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today awarded more than $2.7 billion to public housing authorities (PHA) in all 50 states, as well as the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The funding will allow agencies to make needed capital improvements to their properties. View all local grants announced today.
The grants announced today are provided through HUD's Capital Fund Program, which offers annual funding to approximately 2,900 public housing authorities to build, repair, renovate, and/or modernize the public housing in their communities. Housing authorities use the funding to complete large-scale improvements such as replacing roofs or making energy-efficient upgrades to replace old plumbing and electrical systems.
To help provide residents with decent, safe and sanitary housing and respond to the growing demand for affordable rental housing, HUD uses the Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD), a comprehensive strategy that complements the Capital Fund Program. RAD offers a long-term solution to preserve and enhance the country's affordable housing stock, including leveraging public and private funding to make critically needed improvements.
For more than 75 years, the federal government has been investing billions of dollars in developing and maintaining public housing, including providing critical support through the Capital Fund grants announced today.
In 2011, HUD released Capital Needs in the Public Housing Program, a third-party independent study that estimated the capital needs in the public housing stock in the U.S. The study found the nation's then-1.1 million public housing units were facing an estimated $25.6 billion.
Since Congress authorized the RAD demonstration in November of 2011, early results show it is generating significant additional capital for distressed public housing. As a result, 130,000 public housing units have converted to a more sustainable Section 8 financing platform, all without any additional costs to taxpayers. Public housing authorities and their partners have generated over $8.6 billion to preserve or replace distressed units and support local jobs in their communities - all without additional federal resources."

See chart below of today's funding announcement.
Awarded through HUD's Jobs Plus program, these grants support work readiness and connects public housing residents with employment, education, and financial empowerment services—an evidence-based model proven to help public housing residents find and keep jobs. Many of the grantees announced today are located in Opportunity Zones. Created under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Opportunity Zones aim to stimulate long-term investments in low-income communities. Read more about how these PHAs will put their grant funds to work.
""HUD is committed to empowering public housing residents with new educational and economic tools to improve self-sufficiency,"" said Secretary Carson. ""HUD is proud to work with our local partners to help more residents find employment so that they can reach their full potential and become role models to future generations.""

The Jobs Plus program expands on a successful demonstration program model that combines traditional employment, training, and job placement services with a rent incentive and a place-based investment in building community support for work. The program requires PHAs to partner locally with Department of Labor Workforce Development Boards and American Jobs Centers. Additionally, Jobs Plus grantees are required to demonstrate a twenty-five percent match from community partners, providing wrap-around supportive services to improve employment and earnings outcomes. Cross-agency partnerships are essential to changing the economic prospects of public housing residents. Jobs Plus' place -based model helps residents support each other through the process, cultivating culture of work and enhancing economic resiliency.

02/14/2020:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2020/pr20-030.cfm,New Report Explores Problem of 'Credit Invisibility' Among HUD-Assisted Households,"WASHINGTON - Landlords and property management groups regularly use credit checks to make determinations about renting to potential tenants and many employers incorporate credit checks in hiring decisions. A low credit score or credit invisibility can thusly limit housing choice and employment opportunity for low-income families. A new first-of-its-kind study from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Policy and Economic Research Council (PERC) finds that if the rent payments of HUD-assisted families are reported to credit reporting agencies, many of these households would cease being 'credit invisible.'
The joint study, ""Potential Impacts of Credit Reporting Public Housing Rental Payment Data (https://huduser.gov/portal/publications/Potential-Impacts-of-Credit-Reporting.html),"" relied upon rental data from three Public Housing Authorities (PHAs): The Housing Authority of Cook County (IL); the Louisville (KY) Metro Housing Authority; and the Seattle Housing Authority. HUD and PERC examined how reporting rent payments made by thousands of HUD-assisted households to nationwide consumer reporting agencies would impact the credit ratings of these families. The study also sought to determine whether reporting rent payments to consumer credit reporting companies would overcome the problem of 'credit invisibility.'
""Rent is the largest monthly recurring expense that many households pay and reporting it can be a powerful way to reduce credit invisibility,"" said Seth Appleton, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research. ""This unprecedented study will excite a new conversation about the need for focusing on improving the credit of low-income families, and how on time rent payment is an important way to show credit-worthiness.""
Report co-author and PERC President Dr. Michael Turner said, ""53 million people in the US have sparse or no credit history which can lead to a credit Catch 22 - in order to qualify for credit, you must already have credit. This study shows a path to affordable mainstream credit for many HUD-assisted tenants and renters of all types by leveraging rental payment data.""
The study analyzed credit scores (from Experian and TransUnion) of more than 9,000 HUD-assisted households in Cook County, Illinois; Louisville, Kentucky; and Seattle using credit risk models from FICO and VantageScore®. Reporting rental payment data resulted in a significant increase in the number of HUD-assisted tenants with credit scores above 620 between 54 and 65 percent. In addition, the inclusion of rental payment data nearly eliminated credit invisibility among HUD-assisted tenants. In one risk model, the rate of 'unscoreable' tenants fell from 49-to-seven percent; in another risk model, the share of tenants with little or no credit history fell from 11-to-zero percent.
While this study shows rent payment performance can improve both credit visibility and the fraction of tenants with credit scores above 620, it also shows that many public housing tenants continue to have subprime credit scores that can limit their housing choices and their ability to obtain insurance. Other HUD research finds that low credit scores substantially limit tenant choice on where they search for private rental housing and that tenants are motivated to improve their credit, receive financial education, and take advantage of available credit counseling.
Promoting economic opportunity by encouraging self-sufficiency and financial stability among HUD-assisted residents is a HUD priority. Poor credit can be a barrier to obtaining better housing. This study, in combination with other research show that extremely low-income families are not as high a credit risk as current credit models predict."

02/20/2020:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2020/pr20-032.cfm,HUD Announces Settlement With California Landlords Resolving Claim of Housing Discrimination,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced the approval of a Conciliation Agreement between Inland Fair Housing and Mediation Board and a group of Upland, CA, property owners and managers resolving allegations that they discriminated against families with children by refusing to rent to them and by imposing different occupancy terms and conditions to families with children. Read the agreement.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to deny or limit housing because a family has children under the age of 18, and to make statements or establish rules and policies that discriminate against families with children. Housing may exclude children only if it meets the Fair Housing Act's exemption for housing for older persons.
""Families looking for safe, decent housing shouldn't be penalized because they have children,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Today's agreement reaffirms HUD's commitment to ensuring that housing providers meet their obligation to treat all applicants the same.""
The case came to HUD's attention when Inland Fair Housing and Mediation Board (IFHMB), a HUD Fair Housing Initiatives Program agency, filed a complaint based on results from their fair housing tests. IFHMB alleged the tests showed the property owners and two property managers refused to rent to families with children and/or offered them different lease terms and conditions. The owners and managers also allegedly implemented an unreasonably restrictive two-person-per-bedroom occupancy policy at two rental properties. The owners and managers deny they discriminated against families with children but agreed to resolve the matter through the Conciliation Agreement.
Under the terms of the agreement, the owners and property managers will pay IFHMB $10,000, abolish any two-person-per-bedroom policy, remove language regarding the two-person-per-bedroom policy from advertising and marketing materials, and have property managers and staff that interact with applicants and tenants attend fair housing training.
Persons who believe they have experienced housing discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (Voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to www.hud.gov/fairhousing."

Read the agreement.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from denying or limiting housing to persons with disabilities. In addition, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by recipients of federal financial assistance. Under both statutes, it is illegal to deny reasonable accommodation requests that may be necessary to allow persons with disabilities the opportunity to use and enjoy their home, such as the granting of reserved parking spaces to persons with mobility disabilities.
""Reasonable accommodations make a world of difference to persons who find the most routine things, like walking from a parking lot to their home, challenging,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Hopefully, today's settlement will send a loud and clear message to housing providers that HUD is committed to ensuring that they meet their obligations under the nation's fair housing laws.""
The case came to HUD's attention when a woman with physical disabilities filed a complaint alleging that FPI Management refused to accommodate her by granting a request for a designated parking space. As a result, the woman alleged she was forced to navigate a steep incline each time she exited her building's parking garage after parking in one of the regular spaces. FPI Management and Wakeland Atmosphere deny discriminating against the tenant but agreed to settle her complaint.
Under the terms of the agreement, FPI Management, Inc., and Wakeland Atmosphere, L.P., agree to pay the resident $12,500 and ensure that property managers at the resident's apartment complex attend fair housing training.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to hud.gov/fair housing, or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, which can be accessed through Apple and Android devices."
02/26/2020:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2020/pr20-034.cfm,HUD and Census Bureau Report New Residential Sales in January 2020,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Census Bureau jointly announced the following new residential sales statistics for January 2020:

New Home Sales
Sales of new single-family houses in January 2020 were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 764,000. This is 7.9 percent (±17.8 percent)* above the revised December rate of 708,000 and is 18.6 percent (±19.2 percent)* above the January 2019 estimate of 644,000.
Sales Price
The median sales price of new houses sold in January 2020 was $348,200. The average sales price was $402,300.
For Sale Inventory and Months' Supply
The seasonally adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of January was 324,000. This represents a supply of 5.1 months at the current sales rate.
Read more about new residential sales activity (www.census.gov/construction/nrs/index.html).
EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take three months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, six months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2 percent) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percentage change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percentage changes are 90 percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percentage changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised 3 percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at the Census Bureau's website (www.census.gov/construction/nrs/how_the_data_are_collected/index.html).

""Connecting families with the resources they need to invest in themselves gives them the opportunity to become self-sufficient,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""HUD is proud to give our local partners the resources they need to help their residents reach the next level.""
These grants are awarded through HUD's Resident Opportunities and Self-Sufficiency - Service Coordinators program (ROSS-SC), which supports local, innovative strategies that link housing assistance with public and private resources to enable participating families to increase their earned income; reduce or eliminate the need for welfare assistance; and make progress toward achieving economic independence and housing self-sufficiency. Through needs assessments, case management, and referrals to community and web-based services, Service Coordinators help each participant advance towards these goals in ways that best fit their needs, personal priorities, and interests.
More than $10 million of the funding announced today is being awarded to grantees located in Opportunity Zones. Created under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Opportunity Zones aim to stimulate long-term investments in low-income communities. See list of grant funding by state below."
02/27/2020:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2020/pr20-036.cfm,HUD Approves Settlement Involving California Housing Providers Accused of Discriminating Against Families with Children,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today t it has approved a Conciliation Agreement between Oberhauser Trust, in Escondido, and its leasing agent, First Core Group, Inc. doing business as Keller Williams Realty, in Glendale, California, settling claims that the leasing agent allegedly denied a father of two children the opportunity to rent a condominium. Read the agreement.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from denying or limiting housing to families with children under age 18, including refusing to negotiate and making discriminatory statements based on familial status.
""Families today face enough challenges without being denied a place to call home because they have children,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will continue working to ensure that housing providers meet their obligation under the Fair Housing Act to treat home seekers with children equally.""
The case came to HUD's attention after a father of two and his father-in-law filed a complaint alleging that the father was denied the opportunity to rent a condominium because he has two young daughters who would be living with him part-time. The father alleged that the leasing agent refused to consider his application for the unit, saying, ""I don't want to waste your time or mine. Sorry."" The owner and leasing company deny that they discriminated against the family but agreed to settle the complaint.
Under the terms of the agreement, the owners and brokerage agency will pay $10,000 to the father and will revise their fair housing policy to contain provisions that there are no preferences against renting or selling properties to families with children. In addition, representatives of the owners and their leasing agents will attend fair housing training.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to hud.gov/fairhousing."
02/27/2020:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2020/pr20-037.cfm,HUD Charges New York Landlord with Discriminating Against Resident with Disabilities,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has charged an Oneida, New York, property owner with illegal discrimination for denying the reasonable accommodation request of a resident with mental disabilities. HUD's charge further alleges that the owner attempted to charge the resident extra fees for having an assistance animal, made threats to intimidate and deter her from exercising her fair housing rights, and eventually evicted her. Read HUD's charge.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to refuse to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services, when such accommodation may be necessary to afford a person with disabilities equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling. The Act also prohibits housing providers from threatening and coercing persons who seek to exercise their fair housing rights.
""It is important that individuals with disabilities are allowed to have the reasonable accommodations they need to fully utilize the place they call home without having to meet extra requirements,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will continue fighting to protect the rights of individuals and families when housing providers fail to meet their obligations under the law.""
The case came to HUD's attention when a woman with disabilities filed a complaint. The Charge alleges that prior to moving into her apartment, the woman had informed the owner that her dog is an assistance animal and that he could not charge her a pet fee. After she moved into her apartment, the owner of the building required her to sign a second lease which specified that she would be responsible for paying a monthly pet fee of $50, a cleaning charge of $575, and a $350 pet security deposit. The Charge further alleges that the woman was required to sign a ""Lease Addendum For Dog In Apartment"" that stated the monthly pet fee was temporarily waived, but she could be charged the monthly fee retroactively if she discussed the accommodation/waiver of the fee with other tenants. Despite initially waiving the monthly pet fee, the landlord eventually voided the waiver and demanded that she pay it. According to the Charge, after she refused to pay the fees, the owner terminated her lease and later threatened to sue her if she attempted to enforce her rights under the Act in court.
""HUD is committed to ensuring that individuals with disabilities are not denied the protections afforded them by the Fair Housing Act,"" said Paul Compton, HUD's General Counsel. ""Providing reasonable accommodations is an essential part of a housing provider's legal obligation to make housing available to persons with disabilities.""
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge. If the judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he or she may award damages to the complainant for her losses, injunctive relief, and other equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose civil penalties in order to vindicate the public interest.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to hud.gov/fair housing."
03/03/2020:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2020/pr20-038.cfm,HUD Awards $5 Million to Public Housing Agencies to Install Carbon Monoxide Detectors,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary, Dr. Ben Carson today awarded $5 million to public housing agencies for the purchase and installation of carbon monoxide (CO) detectors in public housing units where they are necessary.
For the first time, HUD is providing grants specifically for carbon monoxide detectors, through HUD's Emergency Safety and Security Program. HUD announced its intention to make CO detectors mandatory in assisted housing where there are combustion-based appliances and/or an attached garage. The Department sent a notice to all public housing authorities and private owners of HUD subsidized housing reminding and encouraging them to install these life-saving devices in their properties, where not already required by state and local law. Read more about HUD's efforts to protect residents from carbon monoxide.
""Carbon monoxide detectors provide an effective tool to help ensure a healthy home for the individuals and families we serve,"" said Secretary Carson. ""These grants represent an important step toward fulfilling our mission of safe housing for all our residents.""
Carbon monoxide is a byproduct of fuel-fired combustion appliances, such as furnaces and water heaters. If not properly vented, this undetectable gas can be dangerous and even deadly. Last month, HUD awarded $2.7 billion to public housing agencies to repair, renovate, and/or modernize public housing in their communities. This funding can be used to purchase and install carbon monoxide detectors.
The following public housing authorities will receive grant awards. Read individual project descriptions."

Read the agreement.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful for housing providers to sexually harass tenants. This includes creating a severe or pervasive hostile housing environment, or conditioning housing or housing-related services on the tenant's acquiescence to sexual demands.
""A home should be a place of peace and security, not fear and anxiety because of sexual harassment,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Today's settlement agreement sends a clear message to all property owners and landlords that HUD is committed to taking appropriate action when offenders engage in behavior that violates the Fair Housing Act.""
Under the terms of the agreement, the owners will pay the women who filed the complaint $10,000 and attend mandatory fair housing training. The owners will also pay $4,500 to two other aggrieved female residents. In addition, Prudencio will be permanently prohibited from directly or indirectly engaging in or conducting any property management responsibilities.
In April 2018, HUD and the Justice Department launched a nationwide joint initiative aimed at combatting sexual harassment in housing enhancing public education about the issue and encouraging those faced with sexual harassment to report their cases.
Persons who believe they have experienced housing discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (Voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed online at www.hud.gov/fairhousing."

Ten housing authorities will receive this funding, continuing HUD's efforts to assist young adults transitioning out of foster care and who are at risk of homelessness. In January, HUD awarded nearly $500,000 to the FYI Initiative and an additional $260,000 in February, and $410,177 in late March. See chart below of today's funding announcement.
HUD's Foster Youth to Independence (FYI) Initiative provides housing assistance and supportive services to young people with a child welfare history who are at-risk-of or experiencing homelessness. FYI, in conglomeration with local resources, will assist communities in ensuring that every young person who has had experience with the child welfare system has access to safe, affordable housing where they are supported to reach self-sufficiency by working toward their education and employment goals.
""The first ever edition of this program worked so well that further federal support for the Foster Youth to Independence initiative is on its way,"" Secretary Carson said. ""Since we introduced the FYI program less than a year ago, we've been able to help a number of young people aging out of foster care to avoid homelessness, and that's an achievement we can all be proud of.""
R. Hunter Kurtz, Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing added: ""We continue to see direct and immediate effects on the lives of young people receiving these vouchers. A home is the foundation for their future growth and success, and I'm pleased HUD is able to support this population of young people in their development.""
These tenant-protection vouchers will go to public housing authorities that do not participate in HUD's Family Unification Program. The public housing authorities must:
Administer a Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) Program; Enter into a partnership agreement with a Public Child Welfare Agency (PCWA); Accept young people referred by their partnering PCWA; and Determine that the referred youth are eligible for HCV assistance.

03/13/2020:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2020/pr20-041.cfm,HUD Awards Over $118 Million to Local Homeless Programs,"WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson announced over $118 million in grants to support local homeless assistance programs across the country. This round of HUD's Continuum of Care grants will provide critically needed support to approximately 630 local programs on the front lines, serving individuals and families experiencing homelessness. Earlier this year, HUD announced $2.2 billion in grants to support thousands of local programs working towards addressing the needs of homeless individuals and families. View a complete list of all the state and local homeless projects awarded funding (https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/coc/awards/).
""The path to self-sufficiency begins with a safe place to sleep and ultimately, an affordable place to call home,"" said Secretary Carson. ""These grants will help service providers across the Nation continue their work of reducing homelessness in their communities and help our most vulnerable neighbors. The Trump Administration is committed to lifting up all Americans and this announcement is yet another example of our unwavering commitment to empower this great nation through investing in our people.""
HUD Continuum of Care grant funding supports a broad array of interventions designed to assist individuals and families experiencing homelessness, particularly those living in places not meant for habitation, located in sheltering programs, or at imminent risk of becoming homeless. Each year, HUD serves more than a million people through emergency shelter, transitional, and permanent housing programs.
In 2019, most of the country experienced a combined decrease in homelessness, however significant increases in unsheltered and chronic homelessness on the West Coast, particularly in California and Oregon, offset those nationwide decreases, causing an overall increase in homelessness of 2.7 percent. HUD's 2019 Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress (https://www.hudexchange.info/resource/5948/2019-ahar-part-1-pit-estimates-of-homelessness-in-the-us/) found that 567,715 persons experienced homelessness on a single night in 2019, an increase of 2.7 percent since 2018, but a nearly 11 percent decline since 2010. The number of families with children experiencing homelessness declined 5 percent from 2018 and more than 32 percent since 2010. Local communities also reported a continuing trend in reducing veteran homelessness across the country-the number of veterans experiencing homelessness fell 2.1 percent since January 2018 and by 50 percent since 2010.

These moratoriums are part of the continued effort by President Trump to address impacts to the financial well-being of America's individuals, families, and businesses caused by Coronavirus (COVID-19).
""Today's actions will allow households who have an FHA-insured mortgage to meet the challenges of COVID-19 without fear of losing their homes, and help steady market concerns,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""The health and safety of the American people is of the utmost importance to the Department, and the halting of all foreclosure actions and evictions for the next 60 days will provide homeowners with some peace of mind during these trying times.""
The guidance issued today applies to homeowners with FHA-insured Title II Single Family forward and Home Equity Conversion (reverse) mortgages, and directs mortgage servicers to:
Halt all new foreclosure actions and suspend all foreclosure actions currently in process; and Cease all evictions of persons from FHA-insured single-family properties.
• Halt all new foreclosure actions and suspend all foreclosure actions currently in process; and
• Cease all evictions of persons from FHA-insured single-family properties.

As such, we want to provide FHA borrower households with some immediate relief given the current circumstances,"" said Federal Housing Commissioner Brian Montgomery. ""Our actions today make it clear where the priority needs to be.""
FHA continues to encourage servicers to offer its suite of loss mitigation options to distressed borrowers - including those that could be impacted by the Coronavirus - to help prevent them from going into foreclosure. These include short and long-term forbearance options, mortgage modifications, and other mortgage payment relief options available based on the borrower's individual circumstances."

New Home Sales
Sales of new single-family houses in February 2020 were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 765,000. This is 4.4 percent (±14.8 percent)* below the revised January rate of 800,000 but is 14.3 percent (±17.5 percent)* above the February 2020 estimate of 669,000.
Sales Price
The median sales price of new houses sold in February 2020 was $345,900. The average sales price was $402,800.

Read more about new residential sales activity (www.census.gov/construction/nrs/index.html).
EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take three months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, six months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2 percent) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percentage change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percentage changes are 90 percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percentage changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised 3 percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at the Census Bureau's website (www.census.gov/construction/nrs/how_the_data_are_collected/index.html).
* The 90 percent confidence interval includes zero. In such cases, there is insufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero."

The Greater Napa Valley Fair Housing Center and Napa Valley Community Housing and Napa Park Homes, LP, resolved allegations that the on-site manager for one of their properties, Fernando Yela, sexually harassed two female residents.
Additionally, the owners of Napa Valley Community Housing and Napa Park Homes and the property manager were alleged to have discriminated against current, past and prospective residents because of their national origin, familial status, and disability. Today's settlement also involved three other Conciliation Agreements resolving similar claims (see links below). Read the Agreement.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful for a housing provider to discriminate on the basis of sex, national origin, disability and familial status, including sexually harassing tenants and refusing to grant reasonable accommodations to individuals with disabilities. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by recipients of federal financial assistance. In addition, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin in programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance.
""Every person deserves to be able to enjoy the place they call home without being subjected to unwanted sexual advances or unlawful treatment because of their national origin or because they have a disability or minor children,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Today's settlement reaffirms HUD's commitment to upholding the nation's fair housing laws by addressing all forms of housing discrimination.""
The cases came to HUD's attention when two women and the Greater Napa Fair Housing Center, a HUD Fair Housing Initiatives Program agency, filed complaints alleging that the complex's property manager sexually harassed residents of an apartment building owned by Napa Valley Community Housing. Napa Valley Community Housing, Napa Park Homes LP and the agents deny that they discriminated but agreed to settle the complaints.
Under the terms of the agreements, Napa Valley Community Housing will pay $14,000 to Greater Napa Valley Fair Housing Center and will pay $49,000 to individual parties, including the residents who filed complaints with HUD. In addition, the agreements call for the on-site property manager to be removed from any role requiring him to interact with or make decisions affecting residents of the complex.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY).

04/01/2020:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2020/pr20-046.cfm,HUD Awards Over $24 Million to Help Children in Foster Care,"WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) awarded $24.4 million to public housing authorities nationwide through the Family Unification Program (FUP). This funding will make more than 1,900 vouchers available for families who are unable to secure affordable housing for their children or dependents, and former foster youth at risk of homelessness.
Housing authorities will work closely with local public welfare agencies to identify former foster youth at risk of facing homelessness and families whose lack of adequate housing is the primary reason their children are in foster care.
""At HUD, we're committed to ensuring every family has access to safe and affordable housing,"" said Hunter Kurtz, Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing. ""The funding awarded today gives children an opportunity to live and thrive with their parents.""
Additionally, this funding can be used to help provide stable housing for young adults (ages 18-24) who have aged-out of the foster care system and at risk of homelessness. These vouchers will allow families to rent housing from a private landlord and generally pay 30 percent of their monthly adjusted gross income towards rent and utilities.
According to the National Center for Housing and Child Welfare (NCHCW), an affordable housing and child welfare advocacy group, keeping children in foster care is an expensive alternative to affordable housing. On average, it costs more than $48,000 annually per family when children enter foster care. By contrast, housing and services to keep a family together costs approximately $15,000 annually per family. Supportive services for FUP families and youth are provided by agencies funded through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

04/01/2020:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2020/pr20-048.cfm,HUD Issues New Cares Act Mortgage Payment Relief for FHA Single Family Homeowners,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today announced a tailored set of mortgage payment relief options for single family homeowners with FHA-insured mortgages who are experiencing financial hardship as a result of the COVID-19 National Emergency. Also included is an extension period for seniors with Home Equity Conversion Mortgages. Read today's Mortgagee Letter.
Effective immediately for borrowers with a financial hardship that makes them unable to pay their mortgage due to the COVID-19 National Emergency, mortgage servicers must extend deferred or reduced mortgage payment options - called forbearance - for up to six months, and must provide an additional six months of forbearance if requested by the borrower. This mandate implements provisions contained in the landmark Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) which President Trump signed into law on March 27, 2020.
""The last thing any of us wants is for Americans to lose their homes unnecessarily while we continue to fight this invisible enemy. If you're struggling, immediate help is now available. The FHA will continue to work with stakeholders to ensure that the loss mitigation options that are offered for both forward and reverse borrowers are appropriately tailored for the present situation,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson.
In addition to special COVID-19 forbearance, FHA also implemented today the COVID-19 National Emergency Partial Claim, an option to be used by servicers when the COVID-19 forbearance period ends. This partial claim will help eligible homeowners who have been granted special COVID-19 National Emergency forbearance to reinstate their loans by authorizing servicers to advance funds on behalf of homeowners. The partial claim will defer the repayment of those advances through an interest-free subordinate mortgage that the borrower does not have to pay off until their first mortgage is paid off.
Further, FHA today instructed mortgage servicers to:
Delay submitting Due and Payable requests for Home Equity Conversion Mortgages by six months, with an additional six-month delay available with HUD approval; and Extend any flexibility they may have under the Fair Credit Reporting Act relative to negative credit reporting actions.
• Delay submitting Due and Payable requests for Home Equity Conversion Mortgages by six months, with an additional six-month delay available with HUD approval; and
• Extend any flexibility they may have under the Fair Credit Reporting Act relative to negative credit reporting actions.
""For American families impacted by the COVID-19 virus and unable to pay their FHA-insured mortgage, imminently losing their homes is now one less fear they should have. Today's actions will ease the immediate pressures faced by many Americans who, through no fault of their own, are struggling with financial uncertainty,"" said Assistant Secretary for Housing and Federal Housing Commissioner Brian Montgomery
Borrowers who are not currently impacted and able to make their monthly mortgage payments should continue doing so. However, those who are experiencing financial hardship as a result of the COVID-19 National Emergency should immediately contact their mortgage servicer - the entity to which they make their monthly mortgage payments - to discuss forbearance or other options that may be available to them. Borrowers who are not experiencing an income reduction due to COVID-19 are asked to avoid contacting their mortgage servicer about these options, as these questions will divert resources from serving those truly in need.
To assist homeowners with FHA-insured mortgages in understanding these options, FHA has also published a Q&A for consumers at https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/SFH/documents/COVID-19HomeownerHelp.pdf."
04/01/2020:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2020/pr20-047a.cfm,HUD and VA Announce Support to Help Homeless Veterans in Minnesota Find Permanent Homes,"ST. PAUL, Minn. - In a continuing effort to end veteran homelessness, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) today announced nearly $35,000 to the Public Housing Agency of the City of St. Paul to provide permanent homes to five veterans experiencing homelessness. The supportive housing assistance announced today is provided through the HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) Program that combines rental assistance from HUD with case management and clinical services provided by VA. This award is in addition to the $29.3 million to 216 local public housing agencies (PHAs) across the country that was announced in December 2019.
HUD-VASH vouchers are a component of the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program, and they enable homeless veterans to obtain affordable, decent housing in the private market. These vouchers are critical tools in helping communities effectively end homelessness among veterans.
In 2019, the number of veterans experiencing homelessness declined by two percent and dropped by nearly 50 percent since the HUD-VASH program was created.
""The HUD-VASH program combines HUD rental assistance for homeless veterans with the VA's supportive services to help our brave Americans successfully start a new and brighter chapter in their lives,"" said HUD Regional Administrator Joseph P. Galvan.
""The Saint Paul PHA is pleased to be receiving additional HUD-VASH vouchers so we can continue to serve homeless veterans. It is especially crucial in times like these that we continue to serve those in need of housing. We look forward to continuing our partnerships with HUD and the VA Medical Center of Minneapolis,"" said Corina Serrano, Assistant Section 8 Programs Manager of the Public Housing Agency of the City of St. Paul.
Since 2008, the HUD-VASH program has served more than 170,000 homeless veterans and awarded more than 100,000 vouchers. Nearly 640 PHAs administer the HUD-VASH program. Veterans participating in the HUD-VASH program rent privately owned housing and generally contribute no more than 30 percent of their income toward rent.
In the HUD-VASH program, VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) assess veterans experiencing homelessness before referring them to local housing agencies for these vouchers. Decisions are based on a variety of factors, most importantly the duration of homelessness and the need for longer term, more intensive support in obtaining and maintaining permanent housing. The HUD-VASH program includes both the rental assistance the voucher provides and the comprehensive case management that VAMC staff offers."

This funding will be used to help Tribes and TDHEs carry out affordable housing activities to protect the safety and health of their tribal members and communities. See chart here.
""When President Trump signed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) into law, he wanted to ensure that American Indian Tribes received the assistance they needed to combat the coronavirus,"" said Secretary Ben Carson. ""HUD remains committed to providing Tribes with the tools they need during this national emergency to continue to create safe, affordable housing opportunities for their communities.""
Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing R. Hunter Kurtz added: ""Working to make sure American Indian families get the resources they need during such an unprecedented time was important to President Trump. Today's funding helps HUD's mission to continue to assist some of our most vulnerable customers.""
Indian Housing Block Grants primarily benefit low-income American Indian families. The amount of each grant is based on a formula that considers local needs and housing units under management by the Tribe or TDHE. Eligible activities for the funds include housing development, operation and maintenance, modernization of existing housing, housing services to eligible families and individuals, housing management services, crime prevention and safety activities, and model activities that provide creative approaches to solving affordable housing problems in Indian Country.
In addition to this much needed funding, yesterday, HUD announced that it began allocating $3.064 billion to help America's low-income families and cutting the red tape so grantees can quickly help their communities."

04/06/2020:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2020/pr20-051.cfm,HUD Marks National Fair Housing Month,"WASHINGTON - Each April, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) observes Fair Housing Month. The theme for the 2020 commemoration is Call HUD: Because Sexual Harassment in Housing is Illegal. The theme serves a dual purpose; first, as a public awareness campaign that urges the persons who experience sexual harassment where they live to 'call HUD' for help and second, the theme reflects the Department's continuing efforts to combat this and other forms of discrimination.
This year's theme focuses on protecting individuals from harassment by property owners, managers, maintenance workers or other residents, and helps to educate the public about what behaviors and actions constitute sexual harassment and resources HUD offers to those that experience harassment.
""While any form of discrimination stains the very fabric of our nation, HUD is especially focused on protecting the right of individuals to feel safe and secure in their homes, free from sexual harassment or unwanted sexual advances,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""This theme, which is a call to action, is an appeal to those who experience discrimination, particularly survivors of sexual harassment, to contact HUD for help. Much work remains to be done, but HUD's efforts in this area are already producing real results for real people.""
""Complaints we receive demonstrate the importance of continuing our commitment to shining a light on this form of discrimination and letting everyone know that HUD is here to help,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Even as the nation is dealing with a health crisis unlike any we have experienced in recent history, HUD is open for business and working to ensure that no one has to tolerate harassment or unwanted sexual advances in the place they call home.""
Recently, HUD approved several Conciliation Agreements with housing providers in Napa Valley, California, resolving allegations that the on-site manager for one of their properties sexually harassed female residents. The settlements called for the owners to pay $49,000 to women who filed complaints, remove the on-site manager and attend fair housing training.
In addition, HUD and the Department of Justice continue to work together through a nationwide joint initiative that is combating sexual harassment in housing.
This year, throughout the month of April, the ""Humans of HUD"" photoblog will feature stories from victims of sexual harassment in housing, highlighting the personal testimonies of survivors and those who helped them. FHEO will also be promoting its popular ""Real People. Real Results."" (RPRR) series, which highlights the fair housing efforts of extraordinary people around the country. Every week in April, HUD will feature a fair housing hero who combats sexual harassment and other forms of harassment in housing. For information about the series, go to: www.hud.gov/fairhousing/sexualharassment.
Every year, HUD and its fair housing partner organizations pursue enforcement actions, work to enhance the public's awareness of their housing rights and emphasize the importance of ending housing discrimination. Last year, the Department charged Facebook with violating the Fair Housing Act by encouraging, enabling, and causing housing discrimination through the company's advertising platform. Overall in 2019, HUD and its partner agencies settled more than 600 complaints alleging discrimination based on one or more of the Fair Housing Act's seven protected classes.
Persons who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY)."

HUD's Office of Public and Indian Housing provides housing assistance to approximately 3.5 million families across the country.
""During difficult times, it is reasonable to expect standard operations and various aspects of ordinary life to be hindered, altered, or upended all together, but as history often has taught us, Americans – working as one – will prevail,"" said Secretary Carson. ""Flexible solutions such as these waivers, which were granted to HUD through the coronavirus relief bill President Trump signed into law, will help housing authorities and tribes meet the unique needs of their residents and ensure all HUD-supported properties are fully operational as we continue working together to defeat this invisible enemy.""
The waivers implemented through the Office of Public and Indian Housing's notice provide administrative relief and allow for alternative approaches to various aspects of PHA, Tribal, and TDHE operations in a safe and secure manner. As various parts of the country are experiencing this pandemic at different levels of severity, this notice grants PHAs, Tribes, and TDHEs full discretion to use these waivers in way that best supports their communities.
At the onset of this pandemic, HUD took immediate action to help HUD-assisted families in public and Tribal housing. In addition to the waiver announced today, the Department has:
Strongly encouraged PHAs, Indian tribes, and TDHEs to use available funding to keep families in their homes, provide rent flexibilities, and conduct operations remotely if possible. Postponed HUD's routine housing inspections at this time so residents and inspectors can minimize their exposure to germs and follow the presidential guidelines to stop the spread of COVID-19.

""Providing families with reliable, affordable housing is so important during these trying times,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""Throughout the COVID-19 outbreak, HUD is continuing to serve our most vulnerable populations that rely on this assistance.""
""HUD wants to ensure families living in public housing are not displaced when they learn their units will no longer be available due to demolition or mandatory conversion,"" said Hunter Kurtz, Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing.

Servicers must grant Multifamily borrowers experiencing financial hardships, as a result of COVID-19, up to 90 days of forbearance when the borrower requests assistance. Servicers can grant this forbearance without direct HUD approval if they follow the protocol in HUD's guidance. Read the guidance for Multifamily lenders, servicers, and other stakeholders.
Additionally, FHA is announcing that, as required by the CARES Act, all owners/agents of FHA-insured Multifamily properties and properties participating in HUD Multifamily assisted housing programs must cease evictions of tenants for non-payment of rent for 120 days.
""The President's decisive action to provide unprecedented CARES ACT relief options for America's Multifamily housing providers will not only stabilize rental housing now, but preserve affordable rental options for our nation's low-income individuals and families in the future,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""While this relief is reserved to help alleviate Americans experiencing hardship due to the pandemic, it is important to note that if an individual's situation affords them the ability to pay their rent, then they should continue to do so to the extent practical.""
To facilitate implementation, HUD is providing a standard Multifamily forbearance protocol to reduce paperwork and streamline processing for borrowers, servicers, and lenders. The protocol includes:
Allowing servicers to grant, without HUD approval, up to 30 days of forbearance for borrowers experiencing a financial hardship due to COVID-19 if the borrower was current on their mortgage payments as of February 1, 2020; Allowing automatic forbearance extensions from servicers to borrowers for up to two additional 30-day periods, without HUD approval; and Encouraging borrowers to enter into repayment plans with renters (residential and commercial) that experience an income reduction or temporary loss of household income but are able to make up the difference over time, without HUD approval.
• Allowing servicers to grant, without HUD approval, up to 30 days of forbearance for borrowers experiencing a financial hardship due to COVID-19 if the borrower was current on their mortgage payments as of February 1, 2020;

• Encouraging borrowers to enter into repayment plans with renters (residential and commercial) that experience an income reduction or temporary loss of household income but are able to make up the difference over time, without HUD approval.
""The key provisions of the CARES Act, and our implementation guidance, are meant to provide relief to those Multifamily borrowers who are in immediate financial danger due to a reduction of rental receipts from their tenants –tenants who may also be struggling financially due to COVID-19,"" said Assistant Secretary of Housing and Federal Housing Commissioner Brian Montgomery.
The guidance also includes important information for Multifamily borrowers, lenders, and servicers about addressing cash flow shortages, repayment plans, and other options to bring a mortgage current following a forbearance period."

The funds are being provided through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES) of 2020, which President Trump signed into law to provide federal agencies with the resources needed to combat COVID-19. Click here for the Notice.
""The Fair Housing Act embodies the spirit of this great Nation where everyone is entitled to equal opportunity and respect,"" said Secretary Carson. ""As we battle this invisible enemy, we need to be attentive to the heightened protections and needs of family, friends and neighbors who are older, have disabilities, or pre-existing medical conditions. We also need to honor and support, not evict out of fear, the medical professionals and caregivers who selflessly go to the front line to serve and heal. We must be creative and compassionate to keep each other safely sheltered, healthy and prepared. Right now, in the spirit of fair housing, we need to be the best neighbors we can be for one another.""
""Addressing potential fair housing issues related to COVID-19 will require resources that extend beyond the federal government,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""FHAP agencies not only have expertise in conducting a range of fair housing enforcement activities, they are especially attuned to how particular issues are affecting their communities.""
Partnership funds allow FHAP agencies to utilize the services of individuals and/or public, private, for-profit, or not-for-profit organizations that have expertise in enforcing federal, state, and local fair housing laws. Similarly, Special Enforcement Effort funds enhance the fair housing enforcement activities of FHAP agencies.
Examples of fundable activities include: Partnering with grassroots, faith-based or other community-based organizations to conduct COVID-19 related education and outreach to people of different backgrounds on how to live together peacefully in the same housing complex, neighborhood, or community; or procurement and/or development of up-to-date or advanced technology to do COVID-19 related education and outreach using on-line platforms and social media.
HUD will issue detailed instructions to agencies regarding the availability of funds and process for application. FHAP agencies are state and local agencies that enforce state and local laws that are substantially equivalent to the federal Fair Housing Act. Currently there are approximately 75 FHAP agencies operating throughout the nation.
Persons who believe they have experienced housing discrimination may file a complaint of discrimination by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 or visiting How to File a Complaint on HUD's website. Materials and assistance are available for persons with limited English proficiency. Individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing may contact the Department using the Federal Relay Service at 800-877-8339."

Local leaders, residents, and stakeholders, such as public housing authorities, cities, schools, police, business owners, nonprofits, and private developers, come together to create and implement a plan that revitalizes distressed HUD housing and addresses the challenges in the surrounding neighborhood. The program helps communities transform neighborhoods by revitalizing severely distressed public and/or assisted housing and catalyzing critical improvements in the neighborhood, including vacant property, housing, businesses, services and schools.
Choice Neighborhoods is focused on three core goals:
• Housing: Replace distressed public and assisted housing with high-quality mixed-income housing that is well-managed and responsive to the needs of the surrounding neighborhood.
• People: Improve outcomes of households living in the target housing related to employment and income, health, and children's education.
• Neighborhood: Create the conditions necessary for public and private reinvestment in distressed neighborhoods to offer the kinds of amenities and assets, including safety, good schools, and commercial activity, that are important to families' choices about their community.
The four awardees will create 3,641 new mixed-income units as part of an overall effort to revitalize neighborhoods. Based on information provided in the applications for funding, for every $1 in Choice Neighborhoods funds, the awardees will leverage an additional $12 in public and private financing for their project proposals. Together, these four communities self-report leveraging an initial $1.58 billion through other public/private sources to magnify their impact. Three of the awarded communities are also designated Opportunity Zones, attracting further federal investments.
Choice Neighborhoods builds on the successes of HUD's HOPE VI Program, linking housing improvements with a wide variety of public services and neighborhood improvements to create neighborhoods of opportunity. Choice Neighborhoods is HUD's signature place-based program, which supports innovative and inclusive strategies that bring public and private partners together to help break the cycle of intergenerational poverty."

04/29/2020:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2020/pr20-057.cfm,Secretary Ben Carson Commends DOJ's Decision to Launch Investigation into Sexual Harassment Complaints,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Carson today praised Attorney General William Barr for devoting all ""necessary resources"" to aide HUD investigations (https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/494381-barr-calls-on-us-attorneys-to-investigate-reports-of-landlords) into reports of landlords demanding sexual favors in exchange for rent.
""The Fair Housing Act embodies the spirit of this great Nation where everyone is entitled to equal opportunity and respect,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""No one should have to endure sexual harassment and degrading treatment, especially to keep a roof over their heads. I'm pleased Attorney General Barr has partnered with HUD to fully investigate and prevent sexual harassment in housing particularly during this difficult time in our country.""
The Department of Justice (DOJ) investigation coincides with National Fair Housing month and the HUD public awareness campaign - Call HUD: Because Sexual Harassment in Housing is Illegal.
Since the joint HUD-DOJ sexual harassment initiative was launched two years ago, HUD and its partner organizations have processed around 540 sexual harassment complaints. Brave victims have spoken out and shared their stories about sexual harassment by their landlord (www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QlkAFzgJOI) or property manager to help educate others on their Fair Housing rights and highlight HUD's available resources to protect tenants and their families.
April is Fair Housing Month, a time to shine light on the law that makes housing discrimination for any reason illegal. This year's theme for the month, Call HUD: Because Sexual Harassment in Housing is Illegal, is timely, and important, and focuses on protecting individuals from harassment by property owners, managers, maintenance workers or other residents. In addition, it helps to educate the public about what behaviors and actions constitute sexual harassment and promotes resources HUD offers to those who are subjected to harassment.
HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity will offer training for the public on sexual harassment in housing in the weeks to come. This national training event is intended to increase the public's knowledge of sexual and other forms of harassment in housing, how to prevent it from occurring, and how to address it when it happens. This web-based, self-paced training may be viewed on the ""Preventing Sexual and Other Discriminatory Harassment in Housing (www.hudexchange.info/trainings/preventing-harassment/)"" webpage on HUD Exchange.
Persons who believe they have experienced housing discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 or visiting How to File a Complaint on HUD's website. Materials and assistance are available for persons with limited English proficiency. Individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing may contact the Department using the Federal Relay Service at 800-877-8339."

Six housing authorities will receive this funding, continuing HUD's efforts to assist young adults transitioning out of foster care and who are at risk of homelessness. FYI announcements have now totaled over $1.1 million this year.
HUD's Foster Youth to Independence (FYI) Initiative is an initiative that provides housing assistance and supportive services to young people with a child welfare history who are at-risk-of or experiencing homelessness. FYI, in conglomeration with local resources, will assist communities in ensuring that every young person who has had experience with the child welfare system has access to safe, affordable housing where they are supported to reach self-sufficiency by working toward their education and employment goals.
""The unprecedented pandemic we now face has shined a light on the importance of having a place to call home,"" said Secretary Ben Carson. ""The FYI program affords young people who are aging out of foster care with a place of their own, helping to ensure their health and safety while providing them with stability as they transition into the next chapter of their lives.""
R. Hunter Kurtz, Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing added: ""As we recognize Foster Youth during the month of May, PIH is proud to see the continued direct and immediate effects the Foster Youth to Independence Initiative has had on the lives of young people receiving these vouchers. A home is the foundation for their future growth and success, and I'm pleased HUD is able to support this population of young people in their development.""
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) estimates that more than 20,000 young people age out of foster care each year. The National Center for Housing and Child Welfare (NCHCW) estimates that approximately 25 percent of these young people experience homelessness within four years of leaving foster care and an even higher share are precariously housed. HUD's Foster Youth Initiative housing vouchers will go to public housing authorities that do not participate in HUD's Family Unification Program. To be eligible for FYI funding, public housing authorities must:
Administer a Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) Program; Enter into a partnership agreement with a Public Child Welfare Agency (PCWA); Accept young people referred by their partnering PCWA; and Determine that the referred youth are eligible for HCV assistance.

05/11/2020:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2020/pr20-062.cfm,HUD Allocates Third Wave of CARES Act Funding Providing $1 Billion for Communities to Bolster Coronavirus Response and Relief Efforts,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson today announced the allocation of a third wave in CARES Act coronavirus relief funding. This wave totaling $1 billion is through the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program. To date, HUD has provided over $3 billion in CDBG funding nationwide to help communities acutely combat coronavirus and alleviate economic hardship.
""Coronavirus has impacted our communities and populations in unprecedented ways, and while some begin to see a decline in reported cases, others continue to fight this invisible enemy aggressively,"" said Secretary Ben Carson. ""This funding will afford states the ability to respond to the unique circumstances they are facing - from reducing risk of transmission to regaining the sound footing of their economy. This is the third wave of funding the Department has provided to States and insular areas, and we will continue to execute a detailed and swift response until the days of COVID-19 are behind us.""
The allocation formula uses variables focusing on public health needs, risk of transmission of coronavirus, rate of coronavirus cases, and economic disruption. The formula uses data on low-income elderly and poor children to target to places with higher public health risk while also using recent unemployment insurance claims data to provide for states hardest hit, at the time of the allocation, by unemployment. All of the factors are adjusted so that places with higher than the national average in COVID-19 cases receive a slightly higher share of funding.
Grantees may select from more than 25 eligible CDBG activities to shape their local programs to meet their needs, including:
A wide range of public services to prevent, prepare for, and respond to coronavirus, such as providing food and health services for low-income elderly persons and children; Small business assistance or emergency housing payments for entities and families impacted by economic and housing market disruptions; or Acquisition and rehabilitation of structures for health facilities, food banks, or public improvements needed to support community coronavirus response, preparation, or prevention. For example, grants may assist improvements to heating, ventilation, and air conditioning in a local grocery store to protect employees and shoppers, or alterations to neighborhood business district sidewalks and facades to enable curbside pick-up or social distancing.

05/12/2020:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2020/pr20-063.cfm,"CFPB, FHFA, & HUD Launch Joint Mortgage and Housing Assistance Website for Americans Impacted by COVID-19","WASHINGTON - To ensure homeowners and renters have the most up to date and accurate housing assistance information during the COVID-19 national emergency, today the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) launched the new mortgage and housing assistance website, cfpb.gov/housing (www.consumerfinance.gov/coronavirus/mortgage-and-housing-assistance/).
FHFA and HUD are offering extensive CARES Act assistance and protection for Americans having trouble paying their mortgage or rent during the COVID-19 national health emergency. This joint website consolidates the CARES Act mortgage relief, protections for renters, resources for additional help, and information on how to avoid COVID-19 related scams. It also provides lookup tools for homeowners to determine if their mortgage is federally backed, and for renters to find out if their rental unit is financed by FHA, Fannie Mae, or Freddie Mac.
""This invisible enemy has a lot of Americans concerned about how they are going to stay safe and make ends meet,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""No one should lose their home because of Coronavirus, and this new website is full of resources to help property owners and renters navigate these unprecedented times. HUD is continuing to monitor the needs of our FHA borrowers and HUD-assisted families, and we are prepared to take additional actions as needed.""
""During these uncertain times, consumers need reliable, fair, and accurate information on the protections and relief options available to them. This joint website achieves this important goal for homeowners and renters, outlining clearly the changes that policymakers are making to assist them,"" said CFPB Director Kathleen L. Kraninger. ""The Bureau will continue to do everything we can to protect the economic security of consumers.""
""Protecting and empowering borrowers and renters while ensuring the mortgage market functions as efficiently as possible has been a priority for FHFA during the national health emergency,"" said Director Mark Calabria. ""This joint website is a one-stop shop for information about the housing protections and assistance available from the government during this unprecedented crisis.""
""Our interagency team began working at the immediate onset of the emergency to address the nation's housing challenges. This new resource was part of that effort, and will provide immeasurable value to the nation's homeowners and renters during this critical time,"" said FHA Commissioner Brian Montgomery. ""For those in FHA-insured homes or Multifamily rental properties, we are here to tell you that help is available for those that need it. We're using every available method, like this new website, to get the message out.""
In addition to the tools made available by HUD and FHFA, CFPB has partnered with FHFA on the Borrowers Protection Program that enables the agencies to share servicing information to protect borrowers during the coronavirus national emergency.
The CFPB has taken numerous steps to protect and assist consumers during the COVID-19 national emergency including making it easier for consumers to receive pandemic-relief payments; informing consumers about their options as it relates to mortgage forbearance; ensuring consumers will be able to continue to send remittance transfers without disruption; releasing a policy statement outlining the responsibility of credit reporting companies and furnishers; and, providing needed flexibility to enable financial companies to work with customers in need. The Bureau continues to process consumer complaints through the consumer complaint system. Through the consumer complaint system, the CFPB gets responses from companies to resolve consumer issues and takes the information into account in supervisory and enforcement work. The CFPB has also released timely information on new programs aimed at helping struggling consumers during this time. These programs include student loan payment suspension (www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/what-you-need-to-know-about-student-loans-and-coronavirus-pandemic/); mortgage forbearance (www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/guide-coronavirus-mortgage-relief-options/); stimulus payments (www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/guide-covid-19-economic-stimulus-checks/); and the paycheck protection program (www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/help-small-businesses-during-covid-19-pandemic/). Additionally, the Bureau has a centralized webpage with information on how consumers can protect their finances during the pandemic (www.consumerfinance.gov/coronavirus/).
FHFA's regulated entities, the Enterprises and the Federal Home Loan Banks provide more than $6.3 trillion in funding for the U.S. mortgage market and set the standard for how the mortgage system works. In response to the COVID-19 national emergency the Enterprises permitted borrowers with a financial hardship due to the pandemic the ability to enter into forbearance, a pause or reduction in their monthly mortgage. The missed payments will have to be paid back by the borrower. FHFA does not require lump sum repayment at the end of the forbearance. The missed payments can be added to the normal monthly payments, paid back all at once, tacked on to the end of the loan, or the borrower can have the term of the loan extended. Renters who live in a multifamily property with an Enterprise-backed mortgage cannot be evicted due to a COVID-19 loss of income. To see the additional actions FHFA has taken to help Americans impacted by the coronavirus remain in their homes, please visit the newly launched joint website.
Part of HUD's Office of Housing, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) is the largest mortgage insurer in the world with an active insurance portfolio of over $1.3 trillion. In response to the COVID-19 national emergency, FHA permitted borrowers to enter into forbearance, a pause or reduction in their monthly mortgage for up to six months. Borrowers can request an additional six months if needed. FHA does not require lump sum repayment at the end of the forbearance. FHA has developed the COVID-19 Standalone Partial Claim to assist with repayment. If borrowers were current, or less than 30 days delinquent as of March 1, 2020, they may be entitled to this option. A partial claim is a zero interest, no fee, junior lien on the borrower's property that will become payable when the borrower sells their home, pays off their mortgage, or their mortgage otherwise terminates. If the borrower does not qualify for the COVID-19 Standalone Partial Claim, FHA offers other tools to help repay missed payments over time.

The extensions will support the President's economic recovery efforts as the Nation continues to work to defeat the COVID-19 invisible enemy.
FHA's Single Family foreclosure and eviction moratorium extension announced today applies to homeowners with FHA-insured Title II Single Family forward and Home Equity Conversion (reverse) mortgages, and directs mortgage servicers to:
Halt all new foreclosure actions and suspend all foreclosure actions currently in process, excluding legally vacant or abandoned properties; and Cease all evictions of persons from FHA-insured Single Family properties, excluding actions to evict occupants of legally vacant or abandoned properties.
• Halt all new foreclosure actions and suspend all foreclosure actions currently in process, excluding legally vacant or abandoned properties; and
• Cease all evictions of persons from FHA-insured Single Family properties, excluding actions to evict occupants of legally vacant or abandoned properties.
Additionally, the Single Family mortgage origination policy extensions announced today allow alternatives for lenders to re-verify a borrower's employment, and for appraisers to conduct desktop or exterior-only appraisals, to continue through June 30, 2020. These temporary measures allow lenders and appraisers to continue their necessary work for new FHA-insured mortgages in light of social distancing requirements.
""We made it clear at the beginning of this pandemic that no American should have to worry about losing their home amidst a crisis. Today's announcement ensures that commitment,"" said U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson. ""While we have made great strides in fighting this virus, the fact remains that many Americans are still struggling as we work diligently to get our economy back on sound footing, which I have full confidence we will do through the leadership of the President.""
""For those among the over 8.1 million single family homeowners with FHA-insured mortgages who need assistance, our highest priority is to ensure that they have the time through the foreclosure moratorium, and the assistance they need through special COVID-19 mortgage forbearance, to remain in their homes long-term,"" said HUD Deputy Secretary and Federal Housing Commissioner Brian Montgomery. ""At the same time, extending our policy flexibilities will ensure that affordable FHA-insured mortgage financing continues to remain available to support first-time and other homebuyers, and the Nation's housing market.""
Homeowners with FHA-insured mortgages must continue to make their mortgage payments during the foreclosure and eviction moratorium if they are able to do so, or seek mortgage payment forbearance pursuant to the CARES Act from their mortgage servicer, to avoid future foreclosure actions when the moratorium expires.
Pursuant to the CARES Act, FHA requires mortgage servicers to:
Offer borrowers with FHA-insured mortgages up to six months or more of delayed mortgage payment forbearance when the borrower requests it. FHA does not require a lump sum payment at the end of the forbearance period. Assess borrowers who receive COVID-19 forbearance for its special COVID-19 National Emergency Standalone Partial Claim before the end of the forbearance period. The COVID-19 National Emergency Standalone Partial Claim puts all deferred mortgage payment amounts owed into a junior lien which is only repaid when the borrower sells the home, refinances the mortgage, or the mortgage is otherwise extinguished.

Provided through HUD's Section 811 Mainstream Housing Choice Voucher Program, this wave of relief funds will provide affordable housing to non-elderly people living with disabilities. See the local impact of the housing assistance announced today.
""As we continue to fight this invisible enemy, we are working quickly and effectively to ensure public housing authorities nationwide are receiving the necessary funding needed to keep their residents safe,"" said Secretary Carson. ""This wave of relief funds will provide additional housing choice vouchers to residents living with disabilities, allowing them to live safely and independently through these unprecedented times.""
""Since the inception of the Mainstream Voucher program in 2017, HUD has allocated more than $500 million for this program,"" said Hunter Kurtz, Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing. ""These new funds, which were approved by the President in the CARES Act, will be important to help those most at risk stay at home during the COVID-19 situation.""
This program helps to further the goals of the Americans with Disabilities Act by helping persons with disabilities live in community-based settings. The program also encourages partnerships with health and human service agencies with a demonstrated capacity to coordinate voluntary services and supports to enable individuals to live independently in the community.
After President Trump signed the CARES Act into law, HUD acted immediately to allocate its first wave of funding - over $3 billion to assist communities and non-profits - to help protect the homeless and Americans with compromised immune systems, as well as assist Tribal communities in their COVID-19 response efforts. And on May 5th, only 39 days after the CARES Act was signed into law - a record for HUD's CPD grant programs - all funding for the first wave of the CARES Act for CPD formula programs was reserved and grant agreements made available to the HUD CPD field offices to support 1,700+ grants. CPD field offices are now in the process of reviewing plan amendments submitted by grantees and executing those grant agreements.
Shortly after the initial $3 billion tranche, HUD announced a second wave of funding to help low-income Americans living in Public Housing and a third wave to help communities bolster coronavirus response and relief efforts.

EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take three months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, six months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2 percent) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percentage change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percentage changes are 90 percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percentage changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised 3 percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at the Census Bureau's website (www.census.gov/construction/nrc/how_the_data_are_collected/index.html).
* The 90 percent confidence interval includes zero. In such cases, there is insufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero."

Specifically, the complaints alleged that the Fairfield, CT-based housing providers refused to grant the residents' request for a reserved parking space or to allow them to move to a first-floor unit, and retaliated against them for making the requests. Read the agreement.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from denying housing to persons with disabilities or subjecting them to discriminatory terms or conditions, including denying reasonable accommodation requests that may be necessary to allow them the opportunity to use and enjoy their home.
""For persons with disabilities, a task as basic as walking from a parking lot to their home or climbing a flight of stairs can be very difficult,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Today's settlement sends the clear message that HUD is committed to ensuring that housing providers meet their obligations to comply with the requirements of our nation's fair housing laws.""
The case came to HUD's attention when two residents of Brittany Springs Apartments with mobility impairments filed complaints alleging that the owners and managers of the property refused their requests to be transferred to a ground floor unit and be assigned a reserved parking space. The residents further alleged that employees of Hub Realty Associates, LLC, retaliated against them for making the reasonable accommodation requests by transferring them to a substandard unit and threatening them with eviction. In addition, fair housing tests conducted by the Housing Equity Center of PA indicated that Hub Realty staff refused to allow testers posing as applicants with disabilities to have designated parking spaces. Both Brittany Springs Associates, LLC, and Hub Realty Associates, LLC, denied the residents' claims of discrimination but agreed to settle their complaints.
Under the terms of the Conciliation Agreement, Brittany Springs Associates, LLC, and Hub Realty Associates, LLC, will pay the residents $80,000, develop a nondiscrimination and reasonable accommodation policy, and have agents who have either direct leasing responsibilities at the property or authority to grant or deny reasonable accommodation requests attend fair housing training.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY)."

06/04/2020:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2020/pr20-072.cfm,Federal Housing Administration Announces Guidance for Insuring Single Family Home Mortgages in Forbearance,"WASHINGTON - Today, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) announced a new, temporary policy that provides guidance for lenders to obtain FHA insurance endorsements on mortgages where the borrower has requested or obtained a COVID-19 forbearance. This policy will ensure that the safeguards of the FHA program continue to work for new homeowners facing a financial hardship due to COVID-19. The Mortgagee Letter temporarily reverses the current FHA policy, which states mortgages that are in forbearance are not eligible for FHA insurance.
FHA's temporary policy recognizes that there are borrowers who met all FHA requirements for a mortgage at the time of closing but were adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic before FHA was able to endorse the loan for insurance. This policy will also help lenders, particularly small and mid-sized community-based lenders, to better manage the potential liability of having to hold uninsurable loans.
""FHA has continually been at the forefront of providing assistance and assurance for borrowers, lenders, and the mortgage market since the coronavirus pandemic began,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""Today's announcement will give borrowers, lenders, and the market peace of mind as we continue our road to economic recovery in the United States.""
FHA will require lenders to provide an indemnification agreement to FHA for 20 percent of the original mortgage amount, which only becomes payable if the mortgage goes into foreclosure and results in a claim to the FHA Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund. The indemnification agreement is between the lender and FHA and will generally result in a reduction of the claim amount FHA would need to pay to the lender for defaulted mortgages. FHA will not require upfront payments by lenders or a change to FHA mortgage insurance premiums for these mortgages.
""Maintaining a solid foundation to ensure the availability of FHA insurance during this difficult time for the nation includes helping lenders who are the mainstay of community-based lending to manage through the current economic environment,"" said HUD Deputy Secretary Brian Montgomery. ""This policy helps address current and future capital issues for all lenders, including those who are not equipped to hold mortgages on their balance sheets for extended lengths of time.""
""Today's action by FHA ensures borrowers continue to have access to affordable mortgage financing, while managing future risk to the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund as well as our responsibility to the American taxpayer,"" said Acting Federal Housing Commissioner Len Wolfson. ""The indemnification agreement is the best way to balance the need to support market liquidity while also managing FHA's credit risk exposure, all without disrupting the affordable mortgage insurance premiums borrowers enjoy today."""

Sponsored by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes (OLHCHH), June is designated as National Healthy Homes Month to educate families about potential health hazards in a home, and empower them to create the healthiest environment possible for their families.
To highlight the theme of the month, HUD Secretary Ben Carson is releasing a podcast series outlining the ""8 Principles of A Healthy Home."" The series includes helpful information for families and individuals about home health hazards such as lead, mold, and carbon monoxide from subject matter experts across the Department. The podcast is available to stream on HUD's website.
""As a former physician, I understand the important nexus between health and housing because I have seen it firsthand,"" said Secretary Carson. ""At HUD, one of our top priorities is to put that understanding into action and continue to educate families about ways they can keep their homes healthy. National Healthy Homes Month is an important part of that effort.""
This year's theme, Healthy Housing for All, is based on the accessibility of healthy homes–the reality that most steps to ensuring a home healthy are low cost and easy to do. Health in housing is important for homes in rural and urban areas, and across widely differing economic groups and housing types, no matter their location.
HUD, along with its partners, works to raise awareness among the general public about a variety of potential health hazards in homes, provide effective healthy homes educational tools, and encourage preventive actions.
In addition to the podcast, a series of webinars will be held by HUD's Office of Healthy Homes throughout the month.

06/08/2020:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2020/pr20-075.cfm,HUD Marks National Homeownership Month,"WASHINGTON - This week, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) marks the beginning of Homeownership Month 2020 - a time of year when HUD, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and others recognize the importance of homeownership and its impact upon the lives of American families, local neighborhoods, and the national economy. During the coronavirus pandemic, millions of Americans are seeking assistance to achieve or sustain homeownership as the foundation to the health and well-being of their families.
President Donald J. Trump proclaimed June 2020 National Homeownership Month (https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/proclamation-national-homeownership-month-2020/). ""For generations, homeownership has sustained and empowered Americans. Recently, we have been reminded that our homes are central to our health, our independence, and the well-being of our families. In response to the coronavirus outbreak, millions of Americans have transformed their homes into safe havens, virtual workplaces, classrooms, and, most importantly, places to nurture hopes and dreams for the future. During National Homeownership Month, we acknowledge the many benefits of secure and affordable homeownership.""
""Each June we commemorate the importance of homeownership. During the coronavirus outbreak, among our highest priorities at HUD has been to keep people secure in their homes. Representing more than 15% of gross domestic product, housing is critical to our economy, valuable to American families, and the bedrock of HUD's mission. For most American families, their home is both their largest investment and biggest expense, and serves as the cornerstone of health and security, particularly during this challenging time,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson.
""This has been a year we will all remember, when the value of owning a safe, healthy, affordable home was truly evident. We recognize this month with a renewed sense of purpose to continuing to help those who need us the most to keep their homes,"" said HUD Deputy Secretary Brian Montgomery.
""National Homeownership Month is especially meaningful this year as COVID-19 has transformed our homes into offices, classrooms, and sanctuaries,"" said Len Wolfson, Acting Federal Housing Commissioner. ""As we mark Homeownership Month, FHA staff are laser focused on helping hardworking families stay in their homes and protect their piece of the American dream.""
HUD's Office of Housing plays a vital role for the nation's homebuyers, homeowners, renters, and communities through its nationally administered programs. It includes the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), one of the largest mortgage insurers in the world."

Since the initiative was launched in June of 2019, 26 states have received FYI funding, equating to 654 individual vouchers, totaling over $5.4 million in funds to prevent or end homelessness among young adults under the age of 25 who are in, or have recently left, the foster care system without a home to go to.
""In under one year since its launch, the FYI program has awarded more than 600 vouchers to 26 states across the country. In other words, this program has impacted the lives of 600 plus young people, not only giving them a home of their own, but providing them with the tools to be self-sufficient and achieve their dreams. Today's announcement of nearly $100,000 continues the momentum of this powerful initiative for the young men and women who will shape our nation's future,"" said Secretary Carson.
HUD's Foster Youth to Independence (FYI) Initiative is an initiative that provides housing assistance and supportive services to young people with a child welfare history who are at-risk-of or experiencing homelessness. FYI, in conglomeration with local resources, will assist communities in ensuring that every young person who has had experience with the child welfare system has access to safe, affordable housing where they are supported to reach self-sufficiency by working toward their education and employment goals.
""To date, we have now awarded over 600 vouchers for this crucial, new program,"" said R. Hunter Kurtz, Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing. ""I'm proud that we are helping one of our most vulnerable populations have a roof over their head during these tough times.""
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) estimates that more than 20,000 young people age out of foster care each year. The National Center for Housing and Child Welfare (NCHCW) estimates that approximately 25 percent of these young people experience homelessness within four years of leaving foster care and an even higher share are precariously housed. HUD's Foster Youth Initiative housing vouchers will go to public housing authorities that do not participate in HUD's Family Unification Program. To be eligible for FYI funding, public housing authorities must:
Administer a Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) Program; Enter into a partnership agreement with a Public Child Welfare Agency (PCWA); Accept young people referred by their partnering PCWA; and Determine that the referred youth are eligible for HCV assistance.

This funding is in addition to $1 billion of ESG grants announced within a week of President Trump signing the CARES Act. View state and territory funding allocations here.
""Homelessness was a major issue in some cities across our Nation long before this pandemic occurred, and unfortunately the dire living conditions of our most vulnerable Americans left many without a home to isolate in or proper medical and healthcare resources to defend themselves against this invisible enemy,"" said Secretary Carson. ""As we continued to monitor the effects of COVID-19 in at risk communities, the Department and our partners worked quickly to respond to outbreaks and minimize the spread from hotspots to other locations. This increased funding to help provide for our homeless will make a difference now as we combat the coronavirus and inform long-term, innovative solutions for addressing homelessness in the future.""
Congress has provided $4 billion for HUD’s ESG program for local governments to prevent, prepare for, and respond to coronavirus among individuals and families who are homeless, receiving homeless assistance, or are at risk of becoming homeless. In total, HUD has allocated $3.96 billion in ESG funding to impacted communities in every U.S. State and territory, and the remainder $40 million is being utilized to provide technical assistance to build capacity of grantees in those communities receiving ESG funding.
The $2.96 billion in funding allocated today can be used to:
Make more emergency shelters available for homeless individuals and families. Operate emergency shelters by providing food, rent, security, maintenance, repair, fuel, equipment, insurance, utilities, furnishings, and supplies necessary for their operation. Provide Hotel/Motel Vouchers for homeless families and individuals. Provide essential services to people experiencing homelessness including childcare, education services, employment assistance, outpatient health services, legal services, mental health services, substance abuse treatment services, and transportation.

06/10/2020:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2020/pr20-078.cfm,"HUD Reaches Settlement with the Housing Authority of Prince George's County, Maryland, Addressing Disability Discrimination","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has reached a Voluntary Compliance Agreement with the Housing Authority of Prince George's County (HAPGC), Maryland, after a HUD compliance review determined that HAPGC denied the reasonable accommodation requests of tenants with disabilities, failed to ensure program accessibility in existing facilities, and failed to make an adequate number of accessible units available. Read the agreement.
Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504) prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by recipients of federal financial assistance, and requires that recipients of federal financial assistance bring their programs and activities into compliance with federal accessibility requirements. In addition, Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) prohibits state and local governmental entities from discriminating on the basis of disability in all services, activities, and programs.
""Reasonable accommodations and physical accessibility in homes can mean the world of difference to persons with mobility impairments and other disabilities,” said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Today's settlement makes it clear that HUD is committed to working with housing providers to ensure that they meet their obligations to comply with the nation's housing laws.”
The case began when the Department conducted a review to determine if HAPGC was in compliance with Section 504 and the ADA. The Department's compliance review identified a lack of accessibility throughout HAPGC's Housing Choice Voucher (HCV), Project Based Voucher (PBV), Moderate Rehabilitation (Mod Rehab), and Public Housing (PH) programs. Additionally, the review revealed that HAPGC staff routinely failed to respond to the reasonable accommodation requests of tenants.
Under the terms of the agreement, HAPGC will:
Ensure that at least 5 percent of its PH, PBV, and Mod Rehab units are fully accessible, and at least 2 percent are designated sensory accessible; Hire an independent licensed architect to evaluate and design the accessible retrofitting of existing units and common areas; Work with disability-rights organizations to recruit landlords with accessible units into the HCV program; Set up a $200,000 compensation fund for HCV, PBV, Mod Rehab, and PH participants who were denied reasonable accommodations; Create a $200,000 modification fund for its HCV program to pay the costs for tenants who need reasonable accommodations and modifications; Appoint a VCA coordinator and a Fair Housing Compliance Coordinator during the 7-year term of the agreement; Develop policies pertaining to non-discrimination and accessibility, reasonable accommodations, effective communication, transfers, and assistance animals and post the policies on its website; and Ensure that all HAPGC staff attend annual fair housing training.

06/11/2020:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2020/pr20-079.cfm,Department Issues Statement on Major Online Advertiser's Efforts to Improve Fair Housing Act Compliance,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced that HUD has worked with Google to improve Google's online advertising policies to better align them with requirements of the Fair Housing Act, where applicable. The Fair Housing Act is administered by HUD and prohibits discrimination in the sale, rental and financing of most housing in the United States because of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability and familial status. Discriminatory advertising in connection with the sale, rental or financing of housing is also unlawful, and includes restricting who sees housing-related ads on these bases.
""Advertising practices may continue to evolve but our Nation's laws are unwavering,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""It is one of our key duties at HUD to enforce the Fair Housing Act and ensure that all Americans have housing choice. Improvements are underway in the online advertising space, and HUD encourages platforms, such as Google, to take these types of steps to eliminate unlawful discrimination in advertising and seek to ensure compliance with our Nation's Fair Housing laws.""
HUD has had a sustained effort under Secretary Carson's leadership to address unlawful practices under the Fair Housing Act facilitated by online platforms. In March 2019, Secretary Carson filed a Fair Housing charge against Facebook for discriminatory practices. HUD has also been engaged with other platforms to improve their policies and practices for housing-related advertisements. For example, Google enhanced its anti-discrimination policies by adopting a specific policy prohibiting advertisers from engaging in certain discriminatory practices when placing housing-related ads using Google's advertising services. Google has indicated that it will continue to work with HUD to foster a better understanding of how the principles of the Fair Housing Act can best be upheld in the context of online and targeted advertising.
HUD offers general and particularized guidance on the Fair Housing Act and will continue to review online advertising platforms to ensure that people are not being denied housing opportunities advertised online because of their protected class. HUD encourages all platforms and advertisers - whether online or traditional - to ensure that their advertising policies and practices comply with the Fair Housing Act.
If you have questions, or you are a person who believes you have experienced housing discrimination, you may file a complaint of discrimination by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 or visiting How to File a Complaint on HUD's website. Materials and assistance are available for persons with limited English proficiency. Individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing may contact the Department using the Federal Relay Service at (800) 877-8339."
06/16/2020:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2020/pr20-080.cfm,HUD Awards Nearly $40 Million in Housing Counseling Grants,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today awarded nearly $40 million in housing counseling grants to help over one million individuals and families access HUD-approved housing counseling to help them avoid foreclosure and make more informed homebuying and rental choices.
The grants awarded today will directly support the housing counseling services provided by 204 HUD-approved local housing counseling agencies, national and regional organizations, and state housing finance agencies (SHFAs). Recipients of these grants competed through the Department's two-year (FY 2019 and 2020) Comprehensive Housing Counseling Grant Program Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) published May 24, 2019.
""HUD-approved housing counseling agencies are on the front lines of helping individuals and families struggling financially as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""These housing counselors help individuals and families in need to get mortgage payment relief assistance now, and to take the steps necessary to save their homes in the future.""
HUD-approved housing counseling agencies provide services to address a full range of housing counseling needs. This includes assisting homebuyers in evaluating their readiness for a home purchase and navigating through the homebuying process. Nearly half of the state and local counseling agencies that were awarded HUD grants received preference because they will provide counseling to individuals and families within designated Opportunity Zones (see attached list).
""Today's funding reinforces HUD's commitment to the important role counseling plays in helping families make responsible choices to address their housing needs,"" said Acting Federal Housing Commissioner Len Wolfson. ""In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, HUD-approved counselors are there to assist millions of homeowners and renters nationwide and help them keep a roof over their heads.""
HUD-approved housing counseling agencies also help households find affordable rental housing, offer financial literacy training to individuals and families, and provide foreclosure prevention counseling. In addition to providing counseling to homeowners and renters, HUD-approved housing counseling agencies support emergency preparedness and disaster recovery efforts, assist homeless persons in finding transitional housing, and help seniors determine whether a reverse mortgage makes sense for them.
In Fiscal Year 2019, HUD-approved housing counseling agencies served 1,015,911 households. Approximately 52 percent of those households were minorities, including 38 percent African American and 10 percent identified as multiple races. Additionally, 19 percent of households served were Hispanic.
There are many ways to locate a HUD-approved housing counseling agency. Visit HUD's website or call (800) 569-4287 for our interactive telephone directory.

06/17/2020:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2020/pr20-081.cfm,FHA Extends Foreclosure and Eviction Moratorium for Single Family Homeowners for Additional Two Months,"WASHINGTON - Today, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) announced a two-month extension of its foreclosure and eviction moratorium through August 31, 2020, for homeowners with FHA-insured Single Family mortgages. This extension provides additional security and peace of mind to homeowners that they will not lose their homes while they are trying to recover financially.
FHA's Single Family foreclosure and eviction moratorium extension applies to homeowners with FHA-insured Title II Single Family forward and Home Equity Conversion (reverse) mortgages, and continues to direct mortgage servicers to:
Halt all new foreclosure actions and suspend all foreclosure actions currently in process, excluding legally vacant or abandoned properties; and Cease all evictions of persons from FHA-insured Single Family properties, excluding actions to evict occupants of legally vacant or abandoned properties.
• Halt all new foreclosure actions and suspend all foreclosure actions currently in process, excluding legally vacant or abandoned properties; and
• Cease all evictions of persons from FHA-insured Single Family properties, excluding actions to evict occupants of legally vacant or abandoned properties.
""While the economic recovery is already underway, many American families still need more time and assistance to regain their financial footing,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""Our foreclosure and eviction extension means that these families will not have to worry about losing their home as they work to recover from the financial impacts of COVID-19.""
""FHA is committed to working with borrowers impacted by COVID-19 and this second extension of the foreclosure and eviction moratorium is another sign of the unprecedented steps HUD is taking to assist those impacted by this terrible pandemic,"" said Acting Federal Housing Commissioner Len Wolfson.
Homeowners with FHA-insured mortgages should continue to make their mortgage payments during the foreclosure and eviction moratorium if they are able to do so, or seek mortgage payment forbearance pursuant to the Coronavirus Relief and Economic Security Act (CARES) Act from their mortgage servicer, if needed.
Pursuant to the CARES Act, FHA requires mortgage servicers to:
Offer borrowers with FHA-insured mortgages up to a year of delayed mortgage payment forbearance when the borrower requests it. FHA does not require a lump sum payment at the end of the forbearance period Assess borrowers who receive COVID-19 forbearance for its special COVID-19 National Emergency Standalone Partial Claim before the end of the forbearance period. The COVID-19 National Emergency Standalone Partial Claim puts all deferred mortgage payment amounts owed into a junior lien which is only repaid when the borrower sells the home, refinances the mortgage, or the mortgage is otherwise extinguished.

06/17/2020:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2020/pr20-082.cfm,HUD Awards More than $35 Million to 31 Local HIV/AIDS Housing Programs,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced more than $35.8 million to assist more than 2,856 low-income persons living with HIV/AIDS and their families over a three-year period. The funding announced today is offered through HUD's Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS Program (HOPWA) (www.hudexchange.info/programs/hopwa/) and will renew HUD's support of 31 local programs. These grants provide a combination of housing assistance and supportive services for this vulnerable population.
""We recognize the importance stable housing can have on a person living with HIV/AIDS,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""Working closely with our partners nationwide, these grants will provide the critical housing and care they need manage to their health.""
Research shows that a stable home is critical to the well-being of persons living with HIV/AIDS, and results in better health outcomes and reduced transmission of the disease. In addition to housing assistance, these local programs will provide supportive services such as case management, mental health services, substance abuse services, and employment training. This combination of housing assistance and supportive services are critical to sustaining housing stability, promoting better health outcomes, and increasing quality of life, which promotes self-sufficiency efforts for those able to transition to the private housing market.
Since 1992, HUD's HOPWA Program has provided national leadership and resources that support the development and operation of high-quality supportive housing programs. Under the HOPWA Program, HUD makes grants to cities, states, and nonprofit organizations to provide housing assistance and supportive services to low-income persons living with HIV/AIDS and their families. By providing assistance with housing and related services, the HOPWA program helps persons living with HIV/AIDS enter into housing, access and remain in medical care, and adhere to complex treatment regimens. More information on the HOPWA program is available at https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/hopwa/.

06/17/2020:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2020/pr20-083.cfm,White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council Delivers Report to President Donald J. Trump,"WASHINGTON - Dr. Ben Carson, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and Chairman of the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council (Council), delivered a report (https://opportunityzones.hud.gov/sites/opportunityzones.hud.gov/files/documents/OZ_Best_Practices_Report.pdf) this month to President Donald J. Trump outlining Opportunity Zone best practices and examples of revitalization occurring across the Nation. On December 12, 2018, President Trump established the Council to support the Administration's pledge to encourage public and private investment in urban and economically distressed areas, including Opportunity Zones. Since the Council's one-year report was issued in December of 2019, the Council has taken approximately 80 additional action items-for a total of more than 270-to promote the mission of Opportunity Zones.
""On behalf of the Council, we are pleased to issue this report, which includes case studies and best practices observed by the Council across the country,"" said Council leadership in the report to the President. ""There are inspiring stories happening in real time, with action being taken by State governments, local governments, Qualified Opportunity Funds, public-private partnerships, and others to spur revitalizing investments in the areas of most need. This report will prove to be especially helpful and encouraging to communities as they continue to admirably fight the invisible enemy known as COVID-19.""
The Council's report features months of hard work and observation of community redevelopment and nourishment. The report is divided into five sections and makes references to the newly released Volume Two of the Council's Community Toolkit, which is also available on the ""OpportunityZones.gov"" website. The five sections of the report include the following: (1) Best Practices of Local Governments, (2) Best Practices of State Governments, (3) Best Practices of the Foundations and Non-Profits Making an impact in Opportunity Zones, (4) Best Practices of Qualified Opportunity Funds, and (5) Pairing Opportunity Zone Capital with Federal Resources. A brief description and excerpt of each of the five sections can be viewed below.
• Best Practices of Local Governments The report features examples of communities that have put their residents' voices first with respect to Opportunity Zones. It identifies several cities that have emerged as national leaders in the Opportunity Zones space. The best practices of local governments include utilization of existing community infrastructure and anchor institutions in accordance with revitalization strategies, and removal of unnecessary barriers to construction. Additionally, this section discusses projects planned for years that had languished until the Opportunity Zones incentive was established. The report looks beyond Qualified Opportunity Fund investments and considers the ways that Opportunity Zone communities have leveraged their designation for other types of investment as well.
• State-Level Actions Benefiting Opportunity Zones The report identifies legislation and executive actions that States have taken to aid the Federal Opportunity Zones mission. The report further discusses the efforts of State agencies to become involved in the Opportunity Zones space, including through contests and competitions, and outlines ways that State-specific actions regarding Opportunity Zones have created certainty and stability for investors. The second section also features examples of State websites that offer a ""matchmaking service"" between investors and entrepreneurs in Opportunity Zones. Each State's Opportunity Zones-related website link can be found on the homepage of the ""OpportunityZones.gov"" website.
• Foundations and Non-Profits Making an Impact in Opportunity Zones The report offers examples of national foundations with billions of dollars in assets that provide support to Opportunity Zone communities and investors who seek to make a positive social and economic impact. It also offers examples of charitable organizations that are focused on issues within the Council's work streams-issues like reentry for those who have served time in prison; housing affordability for those who are cost-burdened; and mentorship for at-risk youth. The third section also highlights best practices of private financial institutions that have devoted considerable resources towards establishing unique and innovative tools that can help drive investment in Opportunity Zones and benefit communities across economically distressed areas, whether they be rural, urban, suburban, or tribal. For example, MasterCard's Center for Inclusive Growth has developed a toolkit that reveals insights into the current state and potential for inclusive growth in Opportunity Zones across the country. Likewise, Citi has launched a data-driven platform to support Opportunity Zone investments by aggregating key social information about different Opportunity Zones. The report also references the teams that competed in the Opportunity Zones component of the 2019 Opportunity Project sprints, an initiative of the U.S. Census Bureau.
• Best Practices for Qualified Opportunity Funds As the private sector engine of the Opportunity Zones initiative, Qualified Opportunity Funds are critical on the path towards revitalization. This report provides overviews of specific deals across the country, with the understanding that none of the examples identified are endorsed by the Council. This section considers different geographies, varying industries, and multiple ways that private sector investors have interacted with public sector counterparts, emphasizing examples of Opportunity Zone investments that correlate with the mission of the Council's different work streams. Readers will discover how Qualified Opportunity Fund capital can be paired with other elements of a given capital stack and how those utilizing this new tax incentive can also leverage existing incentives for revitalization.
• Paring Opportunity Zone Capital with Federal Resources The report traces many of the individual agencies that comprise the Council and focuses on the relevant work streams that drive the Council's activities. There are case studies that describe the pairing of Qualified Opportunity Fund capital with Federal grants and outline how Federal resources have been used to host roundtables and workshops focused on the Opportunity Zones initiative. The report dives into some of the data that agencies have collected thus far. For example, this section discusses ways that the Opportunity Zones efforts of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) have helped bring broadband to underserved areas; how Economic Development Administration (EDA) grants have allowed rural tribal communities to welcome more tourists and fishermen; and the potential for better health outcomes experienced by Opportunity Zone residents via U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) grants. This section also highlights tools developed by Federal agencies for the purpose of benefiting Opportunity Zones through the sharing of information-such as EDA's web-based tool, developed in partnership with Indiana University and its Kelley School of Business, and an interactive map by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) that highlights Federal investment in major infrastructure projects located in and around Opportunity Zones.
This report closes by discussing Federal and private data resources for analysis by researchers and decision making for investors, communities, and policymakers. In its conclusion, the report looks both backward and forward. It assesses the current state of Opportunity Zone revitalization across America, and outlines what must be done to protect and expand the progress that has been made.
The report also makes clear that one of the important features of the Opportunity Zones incentive is its decentralized nature. Thus, the Council is not in a position to identify every single best practice, and this report should not be construed as an all-inclusive or exhaustive list of best practices and case studies. The Opportunity Zones incentive will be successful only if the voices and needs of each community and its residents are heard-a core belief of the Council's mission."
06/18/2020:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2020/pr20-084.cfm,"HUD Approves $35,000 Settlement Resolving Claims of Racial Discrimination at New York Apartment Complex","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has approved a conciliation agreement between Long Island Housing Services (LIHS) and Farmingdale Villas, LLC, the owner of apartment complexes in Farmingdale, New York, resolving allegations that employees of the housing provider discriminated against applicants based on their race. Specifically, LIHS alleged that the employees treated white testers posing as prospective tenants who were inquiring about apartments more favorably than black testers posing as prospective tenants. Read the agreement.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from refusing to rent or negotiate for the rental of housing because of race or color. It also prohibits housing providers from treating applicants differently because of race or color.
""The color of a person's skin shouldn't determine whether they have the opportunity to obtain a place to live,"" said Anna María Farías, Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""That type of discriminatory treatment is unacceptable, and today's settlement reaffirms HUD's commitment to taking appropriate action when housing providers violate the law.""
The case came to HUD's attention when LIHS, a HUD Fair Housing Initiatives Program agency, filed a complaint after several African Americans reported to LIHS that they believed they were denied the opportunity to rent apartments at Farmingdale Villas because of their race. In response to these reports, LIHS conducted fair housing testing using white and black testers who posed as prospective renters. LIHS's complaint stated that the tests showed that white testers received more favorable treatment, including being told about the upcoming availability of units, while black testers were told that there was a long waiting list and that no units were available. The owners denied discriminating, but agreed to settle the complaint.
Under the terms of the Conciliation Agreement, Farmingdale Villas, LLC, will pay $25,000 to LIHS, develop and maintain a non-discrimination policy, and provide fair housing training for employees of Farmingdale Villas who have contact with prospective and current tenants and applicants. In addition, Farmingdale Villas, LLC, will create a $10,000 compensation fund for individuals who were denied housing or received misinformation about the availability of housing at Farmingdale Villas because of their race.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY)."

""Juneteenth marks a celebrated date of progress in our Nation's history,"" said Secretary Ben Carson. ""Today, it is a privilege to visit the future site of Tampa's African American History Museum - a tribute to this progress in a formerly segregated neighborhood. Through Opportunity Zone fund investments and partnerships, I am pleased to see this area thriving once again, without losing sight of its rich African American history and roots.""
The ENCORE! redevelopment effort is revitalizing a once thriving neighborhood with rich African American history but faded in 1964 after residents began to shop and frequent desegregated areas. Following race riots of the 1960s, the business district was demolished. In 2007, the Tampa Housing Authority deconstructed Central Park Village with the goal of ""restoring the rhythm of the once vibrant district."" ENCORE! construction began in 2009, and today, it is a 12 city block downtown neighborhood with 662 completed mixed-income housing units with ground floor retail and amenity space, a state of the art district chilled water plant, district storm water vault, solar arrays, parks, and includes the future site of Tampa's African American History Museum.
In 2018, the ENCORE! neighborhood was designated an Opportunity Zone by former Florida Governor Rick Scott. Created by President Trump, Opportunity Zones encourage private-sector investment in forgotten communities. Secretary Carson is the Chairperson of the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council, which was established by the President in 2018. Nearly 35 million Americans live in the more than 8,700 Opportunity Zones across the country."

While there, Secretary Carson spoke with YMCA Central Florida CEO Dan Wilcox and YMCA District Executive Director Jocelyn Boyd about how the YMCA has responded and adapted to the impact of coronavirus, the resources offered to the community through in-house programs, and the recent, partial reopening of the facility for childcare services.
“Coronavirus created challenges for community centers to continue to serve residents while also taking necessary steps to prevent the spread of the virus. The YMCA of South Orlando has reopened thanks to support from the community and utilized its resources to provide residents with no-cost childcare, so parents are able to go to work knowing their child is in a safe and healthy environment,” said Secretary Ben Carson.
“The South Orlando YMCA continues to uplift and provide for residents of the community. This will be further highlighted when the facility becomes an EnVision Center and is able to continue wrap-around services for children and families. The future holds great things for the South Orlando YMCA.”
The South Orlando YMCA Family Center is a 23,149 square foot facility serving as a community hub located in South Orlando. Throughout the year, the YMCA offers youth development programs, swim lessons, summer day camp, often serving as a haven for at risk children and youth living in this fragile socioeconomic community. The South Orlando YMCA has been designated as an EnVision Center and will implement the four pillars of HUD’s national EnVision Center initiative through economic empowerment, educational advancement, health and wellness, and character and leadership.
A national initiative, HUD’s EnVision Centers coordinate with federal partners to empower all people to fulfill their potential by providing the tools needed to succeed."

06/23/2020:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2020/pr20-088.cfm,HUD to Host Virtual Sexual Harassment in Housing Training Forums,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it will host two virtual training forums for the HUD Fair Housing Initiatives Program and Fair Housing Assistance Program agencies. These forums will focus on effective strategies to address sexual harassment in housing and will be conducted through HUD's National Fair Housing Training Academy (NFHTA).
The first forum, titled ""A Conversation on Sexual Harassment in Housing Situations"" will be conducted on June 25, from 2 p.m. to 3:30 p.m., and cover what constitutes sexual harassment under the Fair Housing Act, who is most vulnerable, investigation techniques, case highlights and outcomes, and resources for education and outreach activities.
The second forum, titled ""Investigating Complaints of Sexual Harassment in Housing Situations,"" will be held July 9, from 2 p.m. to 3:30 p.m., and cover topics related to the Fair Housing Act, relevant case law, prompt judicial relief, and the emotional support and care of victims of sexual harassment. Also highlighted will be sexual harassment cases in which HUD, the U.S. Department of Justice, and the National Fair Housing Alliance have collaborated their efforts on.
""Addressing sexual harassment in housing takes more than timely and effective enforcement actions, it requires a commitment to meeting the ever-changing training needs of our state and local fair housing partners,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""The forums that we host will do much to prepare today's practitioners to take on tomorrow's fair housing challenges, even as we continue to operate in a virtual environment.""
In addition to the sexual harassment training being presented, the forums will highlight Attorney General William Barr's and Secretary Ben Carson's priority to fully investigate and prevent sexual harassment in housing.
In April 2018, HUD and the Justice Department launched a nationwide initiative intended to increase the public's awareness of sexual harassment in housing. The initiative includes an interagency task force between the two agencies, an outreach toolkit, and a public awareness campaign that makes it easier for victims of harassment to find resources and to report harassment.
HUD is also hosting a series of training sessions to help landlords, property managers, and maintenance workers in HUD-assisted housing to better understand the Fair Housing Act and what it prohibits when it comes to harassment.

Read more about new residential sales activity (www.census.gov/construction/nrs/index.html).
EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take three months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, six months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2 percent) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percentage change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percentage changes are 90 percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percentage changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised 3 percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at the Census Bureau's website (www.census.gov/construction/nrs/how_the_data_are_collected/index.html).
* The 90 percent confidence interval includes zero. In such cases, there is insufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero."

Nine housing authorities will receive this funding continuing HUD's efforts to assist young adults transitioning out of foster care.
Since the initiative was launched in July of 2019, 26 states have received FYI funding, equating to 677 individual vouchers, totaling over $5.4 million in funds to prevent or end homelessness among young adults under the age of 25 who are in, or have recently left, the foster care system without a home to go to.
""The Foster Youth to Independence program furthers President Trump' commitment to our underserved communities with opportunities for success and self-sufficiency by providing youth who are aging out of foster care with a safe and decent home,"" Secretary Carson said. ""With this newest round of vouchers, we are providing young men and women with independence to pave their own way and create a better life for themselves. That is something we can all be proud of.""
""In just under a year, HUD has awarded over 600 Foster Youth to Independence vouchers across the country,"" said R. Hunter Kurtz, Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing. ""These 11 new grantees all face different challenges housing foster youth in their local communities. I’m proud that the Office of Pubic and Indian Housing has been able to help so many foster youths and provide housing authorities a new tool to overcome youth homelessness.""
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) estimates that more than 20,000 young people age out of foster care each year. The National Center for Housing and Child Welfare (NCHCW) estimates that approximately 25 percent of these young people experience homelessness within four years of leaving foster care and an even higher share are precariously housed. HUD's Foster Youth Initiative housing vouchers will go to public housing authorities that do not participate in HUD's Family Unification Program. To be eligible for FYI funding, public housing authorities must:
Administer a Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) Program; Enter into a partnership agreement with a Public Child Welfare Agency (PCWA); Accept young people referred by their partnering PCWA; and Determine that the referred youth are eligible for HCV assistance.

Read HUD's Charge.
Under the Fair Housing Act, it is unlawful for housing providers to refuse to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services, when such accommodation may be necessary to afford a person with disabilities equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling. The Act also prohibits housing providers from threatening and coercing persons who seek to exercise their fair housing rights.
""Assistance animals are not pets. They provide the support persons with disabilities need to live independent lifestyles,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Having the opportunity to keep an assistance animal is a right and HUD is committed to ensuring that housing providers not only recognize it, but meet their obligation to uphold that right.""
""Individuals with disabilities who need assistance animals to live their lives should not have to surmount unreasonable hurdles to keep those animals in their homes,"" said Paul Compton, HUD's General Counsel. ""Discriminating against individuals with disabilities is unacceptable and illegal, and HUD will continue to vigorously enforce the Fair Housing Act to combat this type of discrimination and to obtain relief for victims.""

HUD's Book Rich Environments (BRE) Initiative (https://www.nationalbook.org/programs/book-rich-environments/) is a collaboration aimed to transform Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) into book rich environments by providing diverse, high quality books and other literacy tools to children and families living in HUD-assisted housing to improve literacy outcomes and ensure all young people, regardless of background, have the tools they need to reach their full potential. The effort is made possible by a partnership among the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the U.S. Department of Education (DoE), PHAs, public libraries and other local and national education partners. Last year, HUD celebrated the distribution of 1,000,000 books to children living in HUD-assisted households or participating in HUD programs.

Specifically, HUD's review revealed that the housing authority discriminated against elderly black applicants who applied for housing at more desirable properties (the Towers) by repeatedly skipping over them on the wait list even though they were next to receive a unit. Black applicants were also steered to less desirable units at one of the housing authority's racially and ethnically concentrated properties (Westgate Gardens). Read the agreement.
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin in programs and activities receiving Federal financial assistance. In addition, the Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to discriminate in the rental or sale of housing and in other housing-related transactions because of national origin, race, color, religion, sex, familial status or disability.
""Families who count on being able to access limited affordable housing should have an equal chance to obtain it,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Today's settlement reflects HUD's ongoing commitment to working with housing providers to ensure that they comply with their obligations under Title VI.""
HUD conducted a Compliance Review to assess the housing authority's compliance with Title VI. As a result of its review, HUD identified discrimination in the housing authority's rental policies, waiting lists, and transfer requests with regard to its senior residents.
Under the terms of the agreement, the housing authority will pay $200,000 in damages by creating a victims' fund and providing direct compensation to the residents harmed by its discriminatory practices, update its policies relating to its waiting and transfer lists and evictions, and train current and new employees who have contact with applicants or residents about Title VI, the Fair Housing Act, and other applicable civil rights requirements, with a specific emphasis on discrimination based on race, color, and national origin. In addition, the housing authority will ensure meaningful access to its programs and activities by individuals with limited English proficiency, including by providing interpretation and translation services for those who visit, write, or call the housing authority.

Specifically, HUD's charge alleges that Fulton County's Columbia at Mechanicsville, LP, Columbia at Mechanicsville Partners, LLC, Mechan-Summech, LLC, Columbia Residential Property Management, Inc., and their former property manager, Kalisha Winston, denied the mother's request to move to another apartment after mold, mildew and other water damage caused by repeated flooding in her apartment began to affect her son's health. Read HUD's charge.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from denying or limiting housing to people with disabilities, or from refusing to make reasonable accommodations so that those with disabilities can reasonably use and enjoy their housing. This includes permitting residents with disabilities to move to another apartment when their disabilities make it necessary.
""Reasonable accommodations mean so much to families that have a need for them,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""At HUD we always say, 'you can't be healthy if your house is sick,' so we are deeply committed to protecting the fair housing rights of families, particularly those with disabilities, and making sure that housing providers meet their obligations under the law.""
HUD's charge alleges that the apartment flooded five times, resulting in the buildup of mold and mildew. As a result of the flooding, one of the mother's minor sons developed increasingly severe asthma symptoms that required multiple treatments by a specialist, including surgery. The mother requested that the family be allowed to move to another unit because her son's medical condition was being made worse by the conditions in their unit, but the property manager denied her request.
""When a child with a disability needs a reasonable accommodation under the Fair Housing Act, a housing provider is obligated to provide it,"" said HUD General Counsel Paul Compton. ""HUD remains steadfast in its commitment to holding housing providers and their management responsible for compliance with the law.""
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he or she may award damages to the family for harm caused by the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney's fees. In addition, the judge may impose fines to vindicate the public interest. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages.

These funds are provided through the Department's Fair Housing Initiatives Program (FHIP) both to help people who believe they have been victims of housing discrimination and to educate housing providers about fair housing laws.
""Today's grant announcement provides resources that play an important role in fulfilling HUD's mission to provide safe, fair, and affordable housing,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson.
""FHIP organizations are important partners in combating housing discrimination,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""The grants we are awarding today help to support these organizations on an ongoing basis.""
HUD's FHIP grants support a wide range of fair housing enforcement, education, and outreach activities. These grants allow the groups to provide fair housing enforcement through testing in the rental and sales markets, to file fair housing complaints to HUD, and to conduct investigations. Additionally, the education and outreach activities these organizations conduct also help to educate the public, housing providers, and local governments about their rights and responsibilities under the Fair Housing Act.
FHIP grants are provided under three categories:
Private Enforcement Initiative grants (PEI) - These awards help nonprofit fair housing enforcement organizations carry out investigations and other enforcement activities to prevent or eliminate discriminatory housing practices. Education and Outreach Initiative grants (EOI) - HUD awards these grants to groups that educate the public and housing providers about their rights and responsibilities under federal law or state and local fair housing laws that are substantially equivalent to the Fair Housing Act. Fair Housing Organizations Initiative grants (FHOI) - HUD awards these grants to help build the capacity and effectiveness of non-profit fair housing organizations to continue and enhance enforcement of the Fair Housing Act.

07/01/2020:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2020/pr20-099.cfm,"HUD Updates Equal Access Rule, Returns Decision Making to Local Shelter Providers","WASHINGTON - U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson today announced a proposed modification to the 2016 portion of the Equal Access rule. The Equal Access rule requires all HUD funded housing services to be provided without discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. The new rule allows shelter providers that lawfully operate as single-sex or sex-segregated facilities to voluntarily establish a policy that will govern admissions determinations for situations when an individual's gender identity does not match their biological sex. Each shelter's policy is required to be consistent with state and local law, must not discriminate based on sexual orientation or transgender status, and may incorporate practical considerations of shelter providers that often operate in difficult conditions. The proposed rule modifications also better accommodate religious beliefs of shelter providers. For example, such policies could be based on biological sex, sex as identified on official government identification, or the current rule's mandate of self-identified gender identity.
""This important update will empower shelter providers to set policies that align with their missions, like safeguarding victims of domestic violence or human trafficking,"" said Secretary Carson. ""Mission-focused shelter operators play a vital and compassionate role in communities across America. The Federal Government should empower them, not mandate a single approach that overrides local law and concerns. HUD also wants to encourage their participation in HUD programs. That's exactly what we are doing with this rule change.""
All shelters serving a specific sex must provide people who they do not accommodate with information about other shelters in the area that can meet their needs. Similarly, if a shelter elects in its policy to accommodate persons whose gender identity is different from their sex, persons who have concerns with being housed with persons of a different biological sex, such concerned persons must be provided a referral to a facility whose policy is based on biological sex. The Department will continue to maintain the 2012 portion of the Equal Access Rule which prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity."

Once the CARES Act relief bill was signed into law, an eviction moratorium was enacted for 120 days on Public Housing, Housing Choice Vouchers, FHA-insured multifamily properties, and multifamily-assisted properties. The 120-day eviction moratorium ends on July 25, 2020.
To assist families in mitigating any hardships that may arise, HUD has provided an Eviction Prevention and Stability Toolkit.
The toolkit is composed of a PHA best practices guide, tenant brochure with tips to avoid eviction, HCV landlord flyer to encourage engagement with tenants before the moratorium expires, and repayment agreement guidance in addition to sample documents to provide increased clarity for landlords and renters utilizing the resources.
""Many Americans appreciate the role a safe home plays in our everyday lives,"" said Secretary Ben Carson. ""The Department continues to work with housing providers and renters to prevent any threat to the housing stability of Americans, which is central to their health and well-being, especially in the wake of the coronavirus. Since the onset of this pandemic, we have taken proactive measures to keep Americans in their homes, and this toolkit continues our work.""
For FHA-insured multifamily properties and multifamily-assisted properties where the owner is receiving forbearance mortgage payment relief, tenants cannot be evicted solely for nonpayment of rent for the duration of the forbearance period. HUD issued guidance on July 1 for owners of these properties, including a new online brochure for owners to share with tenants.
In addition, since the onset of COVID-19, HUD took action to help homeowners, landlords, and renters financially impacted by the pandemic. These actions include:
Before the passage of the CARES Act relief bill, HUD implemented a 60-day moratorium on foreclosures and evictions to protect homeowners with FHA-insured mortgages who are experiencing economic hardship due to the pandemic. FHA has extended the moratorium twice, now prolonged through August 31, 2020. This applies to Single Family forward mortgages and Home Equity Conversion (reverse) mortgages. FHFA made a similar move with respect to loans made by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. At the onset of the outbreak, HUD’s Office of Public and Indian Housing encouraged Tribes and Public Housing Authorities to place a temporary moratorium on all evictions, foreclosures, and any actions that would result in residents becoming homeless or otherwise unstable. Tribes are encouraged to provide any rent relief and loss mitigation to any eligible families that cannot make rent or homebuyer payments at this time. Once the CARES Act relief bill was signed into law, an eviction moratorium was enacted for 120 days on Public Housing, Housing Choice Vouchers, FHA-insured multifamily properties, and multifamily-assisted properties. The 120-day eviction moratorium ends on July 25, 2020, except for these properties that have an FHA-insured mortgage in forbearance, or HUD Multifamily Housing assisted properties. For these properties, the eviction moratorium remains in place for the duration of the forbearance period. HUD provided a PHA best practices guide, tenant brochure with tips to avoid eviction, HCV landlord flyer to encourage engagement with tenants before the moratorium expires, and repayment agreement guidance in addition to sample documents to provide increased clarity for landlords and renters utilizing the resources. The Office of Native American Programs (ONAP) published FAQs to help Tribes, tribally designated housing entities, lenders, and tenants understand the CARES Act eviction moratorium and how it applies under certain ONAP programs. ONAP also published a flyer for covered tenants to assist them with understanding their rights under the eviction moratorium. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) launched the new mortgage and housing assistance website, cfpb.gov/housing.

07/08/2020:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2020/pr20-102.cfm,FHA Expands Home Retention Measures for Homeowners Financially Impacted by COVID-19,"WASHINGTON - The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) today announced additional home retention measures to help homeowners with FHA-insured single family mortgages who are financially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic to bring their mortgage current at the end of their COVID-19 forbearance. Effective immediately, mortgage servicers will be able to use an expanded menu of loss mitigation tools, known as a ""waterfall,"" to assess homeowners' eligibility for other options to bring their mortgages current if they do not qualify for FHA's COVID-19 National Emergency Standalone Partial Claim. These options are available for homeowners whose mortgages were current or less than 30 days past due as of March 1, 2020.
""Our goal throughout this crisis has been to prevent American homeowners from losing their homes through no fault of their own,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""Providing more solutions now to save homes in the future is part of the Administration's unprecedented response to the crisis and will contribute to the larger economic recovery already underway.""
FHA's COVID-19 home retention waterfall for homeowners who occupy their FHA-insured single family residences now includes requiring servicers to assess homeowners for the following at or before the end of their forbearance period:
• The COVID-19 National Emergency Standalone Partial Claim takes all past due mortgage amounts and puts them in a separate, junior lien of up to 30 percent of the mortgage's unpaid principal balance. This junior lien is only repayable when the mortgage ends, which, for most borrowers, is when they refinance or sell their home.
• The COVID-19 Owner-Occupant Loan Modification is for homeowners who do not qualify for the COVID-19 Standalone Partial Claim. It modifies the rate and term of the existing mortgage.
• The COVID-19 Combination Partial Claim and Loan Modification is for homeowners who are not eligible for either of the first two solutions. It allows for the use of a partial claim up to 30 percent of the unpaid principal balance; any other amounts owed are handled through a mortgage modification.
• The COVID-19 FHA HAMP Combination Loan Modification and Partial Claim is for homeowners who are not eligible for any other home retention solution. It reduces the amount of documentation needed to obtain a COVID-19 FHA HAMP Combination Loan Modification and Partial Claim.
""This comprehensive set of measures will help virtually every homeowner who has requested COVID-19 forbearance,"" said Acting Federal Housing Commissioner Len Wolfson. ""It also provides servicers with the tailored and streamlined capabilities they need to provide assistance to homeowners as quickly and as efficiently as possible.""
For borrowers who do not currently occupy their FHA-insured single family property, FHA announced the COVID-19 Non-Occupant Loan Modification, which allows non-occupant borrowers who have received COVID-19 forbearance to obtain a modification to their mortgage rate and term. None of FHA's home retention measures, including those announced today, require a borrower to make a lump-sum payment at the end of the forbearance period. Additionally, servicers are not permitted to charge fees or penalties for missed mortgage payments while the borrower is in a forbearance period."

Read the agreement.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from denying reasonable accommodation requests that may be necessary to allow a person the opportunity to use and enjoy their home. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by recipients of federal financial assistance, and requires that recipients of federal financial assistance bring their programs and activities into compliance with federal accessibility requirements. In addition, Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act prohibits state and local governmental entities from discriminating on the basis of disability in all services, activities, and programs.
""For persons with disabilities, a reasonable accommodation can allow them to fully enjoy the place they call home,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity.

""The Charleston community, and many others like it across the nation, have witnessed the revival of economic activity since the Opportunity Zone tax incentive was established by President Trump,"" said Secretary Carson. ""The new CRA rule will continue to draw bankers, lenders, and entrepreneurs to communities that are ripe with untapped investment and have grounds that are fertile with economic opportunity. Since day one, Senator Scott has been a champion for Opportunity Zones, and I am thankful to be with him and Acting Comptroller Brooks - who's work identified this new way to support community development - today for these important discussions that will power capital investment in underserved communities.""
""I'd like to thank Secretary Carson and Acting Comptroller Brooks for making the trip down to South Carolina. Access to capital is a very important topic for people in underserved and minority communities across South Carolina and our nation, especially as so many are seeking to navigate economic challenges around the pandemic,"" said Senator Tim Scott.
""As the author of Opportunity Zones, I created this initiative to ensure that families in distressed neighborhoods across the country had access to and could utilize the resources needed to climb out of poverty and build towards economic success. Being raised in a single-parent household, I understand the importance of educating the underserved and minority communities on financial literacy and ownership, which is a tool that many are denied in our struggling communities.
""Today's conversations were encouraging, and I'm looking forward to seeing how this workshop yields results not only in South Carolina, but across the nation to provide a hand-up towards economic opportunity.""
""Today, bankers, community developers, and advocates got together to explore how to green light projects that increase access to capital to meet local housing and community reinvestment needs,"" said Acting Comptroller Brooks. ""By combining incentives associated with Opportunity Zones and credit under the OCC's new CRA rule, we have a powerful force for supporting underserved areas and creating sustainable change for communities in South Carolina and across the nation.""
The Opportunity Zones incentive, created by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, was designed to spur economic development and job creation by encouraging long-term investments in low-income communities nationwide. Nearly 35 million Americans live in the more than 8,700 Opportunity Zones across the country.

Secretary Carson made the announcement at a news conference alongside Senator Todd Young, Former Congressman Sean Duffy, and Assistant Secretary Hunter Kurtz. The demonstration announced today is the result of bipartisan legislation co-sponsored by both Young and Duffy.
""As a compassionate country, when we talk about providing support for families in need, we should also talk about how to provide pathways for low-income families seeking opportunity,"" said Secretary Carson. ""The Housing Choice Voucher Mobility Demonstration aims to show how we can empower people by giving them a real choice.""
""All families deserve the chance to live in communities that best suit their needs, but many live in neighborhoods that perpetuate poverty across generations,"" said Senator Todd Young. ""Our Housing Choice Voucher Mobility program aims to end this cycle and help families relocate to higher opportunity areas with lower crime, better education, and greater access to jobs, transportation, quality healthcare, and suitable housing.""
""It is a rare occurrence in Washington when a Member of Congress gets to see a program they worked so diligently on, finally come to fruition. I believe that people deserve every opportunity they can get to be successful,"" said former Congressman Sean Duffy. ""This demonstration helps create a path to break the cycle of poverty for low-income families and move to better areas with more opportunity and put them on a path to achieve the American dream. Thank you to everyone who worked on this legislation with me in the House of Representatives and thank you Secretary Carson for your continued work in advancing the lives of our most vulnerable populations.""
""This new initiative will provide thousands of low-income children and their parents new opportunities for upward economic mobility as well as improved health outcomes,"" said Hunter Kurtz, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing.
The Housing Choice Voucher Mobility Demonstration will allow participating Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) throughout the country to implement housing mobility programs by offering mobility-related services to increase the number of voucher families with children living in opportunity areas. In addition to offering mobility-related services, participating PHAs will work together in their regions to adopt administrative policies that further enable housing mobility, increase landlord participation, and reduce barriers for families to move across PHA jurisdictions through portability.
The Demonstration is authorized and funded through HUD's 2019 and 2020 Appropriations bills, which provided $40 million for mobility-related services and $10 million for new vouchers for families with children. The 2019 Appropriations bill also makes available $3 million for a research evaluation.
About HUD's Landlord Task Force
In 2018, Secretary Carson initiative launched a nationwide campaign to encourage more private-market landlords to participate in the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) Program. Over the past two years, through this initiative, HUD has made significant strides in improving the program for landlords. HUD has talked with hundreds of landlords to better understand challenges they face working with the program. As a result of these conversations, the Department has been exploring opportunities to address these challenges. The HCV Mobility Demonstration will use these lessons learned from Secretary Carson's task force to recruit more landlords to the HCV program.

""After reviewing thousands of comments on the proposed changes to the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing (AFFH) regulation, we found it to be unworkable and ultimately a waste of time for localities to comply with, too often resulting in funds being steered away from communities that need them most,"" said Secretary Carson. ""Instead, the Trump Administration has established programs like Opportunity Zones that are driving billions of dollars of capital into underserved communities where affordable housing exists, but opportunity does not. Programs like this shift the burden away from communities so they are not forced to comply with complicated regulations that require hundreds of pages of reporting and instead allow communities to focus more of their time working with Opportunity Zone partners to revitalize their communities so upward mobility, improved housing, and home ownership is within reach for more people. Washington has no business dictating what is best to meet your local community's unique needs.""
This brand-new rule, called Preserving Community and Neighborhood Choice, defines fair housing broadly to mean housing that, among other attributes, is affordable, safe, decent, free of unlawful discrimination, and accessible under civil rights laws. It then defines ""affirmatively furthering fair housing"" to mean any action rationally related to promoting any of the above attributes of fair housing.
Now, a grantee's certification that it has affirmatively furthered fair housing would be deemed sufficient if it proposes to take any action above what is required by statute related to promoting any of the attributes of fair housing. HUD remains able to terminate funding if it discovers, after investigation made pursuant to complaint or by its own volition, that a jurisdiction has not adhered to its commitment to AFFH.
Persons who believe they have experienced housing discrimination may file a complaint of discrimination by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 or visiting How to File a Complaint on HUD's website. Materials and assistance are available for persons with limited English proficiency. Individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing may contact the Department using the Federal Relay Service at (800) 877-8339."

Read more about new residential sales activity (www.census.gov/construction/nrs/index.html).
EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take three months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, six months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2 percent) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percentage change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percentage changes are 90 percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percentage changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised 3 percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at the Census Bureau's website (www.census.gov/construction/nrs/how_the_data_are_collected/index.html).
* The 90 percent confidence interval includes zero. In such cases, there is insufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero."

Since the initiative was launched in July of 2019, 26 states have received FYI funding, equating to 677 individual vouchers, totaling over $5.4 million in funds to prevent or end homelessness among young adults under the age of 25 who are in, or have recently left, the foster care system without a home to go to.
""Just one year ago, the Foster Youth to Independence program was a mere idea spurred from an impactful conversation I had with youth who had experienced the trials of aging out of the foster care system firsthand,"" said Secretary Carson. ""One year later, the FYI initiative has spanned over 20 states and transformed the lives of young men and women, providing the resources they need to write their own ticket to success. A primary reason why this initiative has been so successful in such a short amount of time is because of the partnership from individuals like Senator Toomey, who is a leader in ensuring that self-sufficiency and success are tangible realities for all our Nation's youth, regardless of the circumstance they were born into. As we round the corner of the second year of this program, I look forward to continuing this momentum to empower our next generation.""
Secretary Carson was joined in Pittsburgh by U.S. Senator Pat Toomey (R-PA), ""In many cases, those who age out of foster care systems remain in need of a helping hand. I very much appreciate Secretary Carson coming to Allegheny County today to detail the efforts he has led at HUD to make sure these young adults do not go homeless. Secretary Carson's work is to be commended and I look forward to welcoming him back to the commonwealth soon.""
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) estimates that more than 20,000 young people age out of foster care each year. The National Center for Housing and Child Welfare (NCHCW) estimates that approximately 25 percent of these young people experience homelessness within four years of leaving foster care and an even higher share are precariously housed. HUD's Foster Youth Initiative housing vouchers go to public housing authorities that do not participate in HUD's Family Unification Program. To be eligible for FYI funding, public housing authorities must:
Administer a Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) Program; Enter into a partnership agreement with a Public Child Welfare Agency (PCWA); Accept young people referred by their partnering PCWA; and Determine that the referred youth are eligible for HCV assistance.

Specifically, HUD's charge alleges that Ithaca Rental, LLC, as also known as Ithaca Rental Company, 130 Clinton, LLC, and Fane Enterprise, Inc., and their rental manager denied the resident's request to have an assistance animal. Read HUD's charge.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from denying or limiting housing to people with disabilities, or from refusing to make reasonable accommodations so that those with disabilities can reasonably use and enjoy their housing. This includes having strict ""no- pet"" policies, charging additional fees for assistance animals, or imposing unnecessary and unfair rules upon individuals with disabilities.
""Assistance animals provide invaluable support to individuals with disabilities who require such accommodations to enjoy the place they call home,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will continue to take appropriate action when housing providers fail to meet their obligations to comply with the requirements of the Fair Housing Act.""
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he or she may award damages to the woman for harm caused by the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney's fees. In addition, the judge may impose fines to vindicate the public interest. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages.

Read HUD's Charge.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from denying or limiting housing to people with disabilities, or from refusing to make reasonable accommodations so that those with disabilities can reasonably use and enjoy their housing.
""Granting a reasonable accommodation isn't giving someone with disabilities special treatment,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""These accommodations make it easier for them to fully enjoy their homes. More importantly, persons with disabilities have a right to such accommodations, a right that's protected by law.""
""HUD is committed to ensuring that individuals with disabilities are protected under the Fair Housing Act,"" said Michael Williams, HUD's Principal Deputy General Counsel. ""Providing reasonable accommodations is an essential part of a housing provider's legal obligation to make housing available to persons with disabilities.""

REAC inspections are the assessment tool that ensures HUD assisted properties meet federal standards of health, safety, and accessibility. REAC inspections were paused due to the Coronavirus outbreak in March of 2020.
""As we continue to fight this invisible enemy and learn more about the safety precautions needed to keep our HUD residents and staff safe, we are able to bring back critical functions of the Department,"" said Secretary Carson. ""Physical inspections are vital in ensuring the health and safety of the Americans who reside in properties enrolled in HUD's programs, and I am very pleased to announce today they are resuming.""
""REAC inspections provides a critical service in HUD assisted properties to ensure residents are living in safe and decent housing. I believe we have found a solution to continue this important function while keeping staff, residents, and inspectors healthy,"" said Hunter Kurtz, Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing.
To keep the residents and staff of HUD properties safe during the inspection process, REAC will prioritize inspections in states and localities based on the latest COVID-19 data from Johns Hopkins University and health risk scoring methodology from the Harvard Global Health Institute. REAC has developed a heat map that categorizes states and localities into four risk categories:
• Low Risk - Green
• Moderately Low Risk - Yellow
• Moderately High Risk - Orange
• High Risk - Red
REAC will provide a listing on its website of low-risk counties 45 days prior to the start of physical inspections. At the end of the 45-day period, REAC will provide a 14-day notification to priority properties in that county to inform families that an inspection will take place. The first outreach from inspectors to properties will start no earlier than September 21, 2020. A comprehensive list of safe inspection locations, as well as an overview of the methodology used to determine them can be found on the website here. Inspectors will prioritize properties with historically low REAC scores (high-risk properties) in Low Risk (Green) localities. These locations will change over time, and HUD will adjust its inspection plans as needed. For additional information on HUD's coronavirus response efforts, please visit HUD.gov/coronavirus."

""Under President Trump's leadership, the Opportunity Zone initiative elevates our Nation's once forgotten communities from economic distress to flourishing areas with new hope and promise,"" said Secretary Carson. ""Today, I am encouraged by the force of positive change happening here in Fort Myers as a result of the Opportunity Zones initiative. I thank Mayor Henderson and the local leadership for their determined partnership in ensuring economic growth and opportunity for all.""
""We wouldn't be where we are today without HUD's investment in the City of Fort Myers,"" said City of Fort Myers Mayor Randy Henderson. ""Secretary Carson has championed attainable housing and public private partnerships that make it possible to attract investors, particularly in our Opportunity Zones. As the industrial and commercial hub of Southwest Florida, these are important programs for our city.""
As Chairman of the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council (Council), Secretary Carson delivered a report (https://opportunityzones.hud.gov/sites/opportunityzones.hud.gov/files/documents/OZ_Best_Practices_Report.pdf) last month to President Donald J. Trump outlining Opportunity Zone best practices and examples of revitalization occurring across the Nation. On December 12, 2018, President Trump established the Council to support the Administration's pledge to encourage public and private investment in urban and economically distressed areas, including Opportunity Zones. Since the Council's one-year report was issued in December of 2019, the Council has taken approximately 80 additional action items-for a total of more than 270-to promote the mission of Opportunity Zones.
Background President Trump signed the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, creating Opportunity Zones to stimulate long-term investments in low-income communities. Opportunity Zones offer capital gains tax relief to those who invest in these distressed areas. This initiative is anticipated to spur $100 billion in private capital investment in Opportunity Zones. Incentivizing investment in low-income communities fosters economic revitalization, job creation, and promotes sustainable economic growth across the nation, especially in communities HUD serves.

Opportunity Zones are a powerful vehicle for bringing economic growth and job creation to the American communities that need it the most. On average, the median family income in an Opportunity Zone is 37 percent below its respective state median. Overall, more than 8,700 communities in all 50 States, Washington D.C., and five U.S. territories have been designated as Opportunity Zones. Nearly 35 million Americans live in communities designated as Opportunity Zones."

To date, HUD has provided over $3 billion in CDBG-CV funds nationwide to help communities combat coronavirus and alleviate economic hardship. HUD is also providing flexibility to communities who want to utilize their existing, non-CARES Act federal dollars to support their coronavirus recovery efforts.
""As communities recover from the impacts of the coronavirus outbreak, HUD is providing States and local units of governments with the flexibility they need to effectively target funds to those efforts that need it most,"" said Secretary Carson. ""In combatting the novel coronavirus, we have to be responsive to challenges as they arise.""
After President Trump signed the CARES Act into law, HUD acted immediately to allocate its first wave of funding - over $3 billion to assist communities and non-profits - to help protect the homeless and Americans with compromised immune systems, as well as assist Tribal communities in their COVID-19 response efforts.
Key new flexibilities available to communities in administering their CDBG-CV funds include:
States may carry out activities directly or pass funds through to local governments in both rural and urban areas throughout the state. (Some funds must be set aside for rural areas.) Economic development rules updated and streamlined so grantees can move quickly to help small businesses, and Emergency payments to a provider or landlord on behalf of a family or individual, usually limited to 90 days, may extend for up to six months.

The Trump Administration has worked tirelessly to combat and minimize the effects of COVID-19, and we appreciate the partnership and example of the faith community in ensuring America's homeless aren't left behind.""
Background:
On March 27, 2020, President Trump signed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) into law to provide emergency assistance and health care response for individuals, families, and businesses affected by the coronavirus pandemic. Among the provisions contained in the CARES Act are provisions authorizing the Small Business Administration (SBA) to temporarily guarantee loans under a new 7(a) loan program titled the ""Paycheck Protection Program."" Loans guaranteed under the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) will be 100 percent guaranteed by SBA, and the full principal amount of the loans may qualify for loan forgiveness.
On April 4, 2020, SBA Administrator Jovita Carranza announced (https://www.sba.gov/about-sba/sba-newsroom/press-releases-media-advisories/sba-clarifies-eligibility-faith-based-organizations-participate-paycheck-protection-and-economic) that SBA issued guidance (https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/coronavirus-relief-options/paycheck-protection-program) clarifying that all faith-based organizations impacted by Coronavirus (COVID-19) are eligible to participate in the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program, without restrictions based on their religious identity or activities, to the extent they meet the eligibility criteria outlined in the CARES Act that was passed by Congress, signed into law by President Trump, and implemented by the Paycheck Protection Act Interim Final Rule.
The PPP has delivered loans to small businesses across the country and is supporting more than 51 million jobs for American workers. PPP loans are helping support economically distressed communities hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic."

EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take three months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, six months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2 percent) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percentage change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percentage changes are 90 percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percentage changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised 3 percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found at the Census Bureau's website (www.census.gov/construction/nrc/how_the_data_are_collected/index.html).
* The 90 percent confidence interval includes zero. In such cases, there is insufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero."
08/18/2020:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2020/pr20-127.cfm,FHA Launches Technology Module for Single Family Appraisals,"WASHINGTON - The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) today announced the upcoming release of its FHA Catalyst: Electronic Appraisal Delivery module on the FHA Catalyst platform. FHA Catalyst: Electronic Appraisal Delivery will allow lenders to electronically submit, track, and manage single family property appraisals.
""Transforming FHA technology is the cornerstone upon which we intend to achieve a stronger business and risk management approach - from enhancing portfolio analysis and implementing time-sensitive policy changes – to diversifying our mix of program participants,"" said Assistant Secretary for Housing and Federal Housing Commissioner Dana Wade. ""The FHA Catalyst streamlined appraisal submission capability is one more way FHA is supporting the housing market with innovative technology during the COVID-19 economic recovery.""
The FHA Catalyst: Electronic Appraisal Delivery module enhances electronic appraisal report submission features while maintaining industry standard appraisal data sets in use today throughout the housing finance industry. In its initial release, the module can be used by lenders to electronically submit appraisal reports and updates for FHA Single Family Title II forward mortgages.
""The electronic appraisal delivery technology is part of our vision to build out the FHA Catalyst platform to expand the effectiveness of our data collection and analysis capabilities,"" said HUD Chief Information Officer David Chow.
FHA-approved lenders may begin using the FHA Catalyst: Electronic Appraisal Delivery module beginning September 4, 2020.

08/20/2020:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2020/pr20-129.cfm,HUD Secretary Ben Carson Hosts Roundtable with Pennsylvania Elected Officials on the Removal of the 2015 AFFH Rule,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today held a roundtable with local and federal officials in Pennsylvania to discuss the importance of local zoning decisions being made by local communities rather than unelected bureaucrats in Washington.
""American suburbs are a shining example of the American Dream, where people can live in their own homes, in safe, pleasant neighborhoods,"" said Secretary Carson. ""We have already seen jurisdictions make strong progress promoting fair housing at the local level, and they will continue to do so without complicated certification processes from Washington that would inevitably lead to blanket national policies on intimate local issues. As it turns out, our Founders had some good ideas when they set up our government—we just need to listen to them. Washington has no business dictating what is best to meet your local community's unique needs.""
""I commend President Trump and his administration for ensuring that Americans have access to affordable housing,"" said U.S. Representative Fred Keller (R-PA 12). ""Rolling back the AFFH rule gets government out of the way, eliminates costly Washington mandates, and supports local control of neighborhood development.""
This brand-new rule, called Preserving Community and Neighborhood Choice, defines fair housing broadly to mean housing that, among other attributes, is affordable, safe, decent, free of unlawful discrimination, and accessible under civil rights laws. It then defines ""affirmatively furthering fair housing"" to mean any action rationally related to promoting any of the above attributes of fair housing.
Now, a grantee's certification that it has affirmatively furthered fair housing will be deemed sufficient if it proposes to take any action above what is required by statute related to promoting any of the attributes of fair housing. HUD remains able to terminate funding if it discovers, after investigation made pursuant to complaint or by its own volition, that a jurisdiction has not adhered to its commitment to AFFH.
Persons who believe they have experienced housing discrimination may file a complaint of discrimination by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 or visiting How to File a Complaint on HUD's website. Materials and assistance are available for persons with limited English proficiency. Individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing may contact the Department using the Federal Relay Service at (800) 877-8339."

Read the agreements.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from discriminating against tenants because of their national origin. It also prohibits retaliation against those who exercise their rights under the Act, or who help others to do so.
""Having a place to call home shouldn't depend on where you come from,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD remains committed to ensuring that everyone, regardless of their national origin, has equal access to housing and that housing providers meet their obligations under federal civil rights laws.""
Under the terms of the Conciliation Agreements, Canyon View will pay the former residents a total of $51,000, revise and distribute their non-discrimination policy, and market housing opportunities to immigrant communities in Springdale, Arkansas, and attend fair housing training.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination because of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, disability, and familial status. Persons who believe they have experienced housing discrimination may file a complaint of discrimination by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 or visiting How to File a Complaint on HUD's website.

08/25/2020:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2020/pr20-131.cfm,New Report Shows Opportunity Zones on Track to Lift One Million Americans Out of Poverty,"WASHINGTON - The White House Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) yesterday delivered a Progress Report (https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Impact-of-Opportunity-Zones-An-Initial-Assessment.pdf) on President Trump's Opportunity Zones initiative to White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council Chairman Ben Carson, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The CEA estimates that Opportunity Zones have already generated approximately half a million jobs, attracted $75 billion in capital investments, and are on track to reduce the poverty rate in Opportunity Zones by 11 percent-lifting 1,000,000 people out of poverty
""This tremendous progress report shows the American people, especially the families who have felt forgotten for years, President Trump's Great American Comeback is in fact underway,"" said Secretary Ben Carson. ""Opportunity Zones have created half a million jobs, generated billions in economic investment, and reduced our country's poverty rate-and is just the beginning. President Trump's bold leadership is providing families with new opportunities to break the cycle of poverty and local leaders with a tool to assist them in breathing new life into communities that have been forgotten for far too long.""
""At every turn President Trump continues to fight for every American,"" said Acting Domestic Policy Council Director Brooke Rollins. ""Today's CEA report proves that the Opportunity Zone tax incentive's focus on job growth, rewarding employment, and removing bureaucratic middle-men is lifting millions out of poverty and revitalizing communities that haven't seen investment in decades.""
""Today's CEA report simply confirms the transformative projects, businesses, and revitalization I have seen across the country in small towns, suburban communities, and urban centers thanks to President Trump's Opportunity Zones,"" said White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council Executive Director Scott Turner. ""The numbers in this report are lives and communities that are being transformed and where the future is bright.""
To compile the Progress Report, the Council of Economic Advisers examined Opportunity Zone investments and activities through the end of 2019. CEA found the tax cuts have spurred a large investment response. Highlights of the report (https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Impact-of-Opportunity-Zones-An-Initial-Assessment.pdf) include:
• Opportunity Zones have attracted $75 billion in capital investments as of the end of 2019. $52 billion would not have entered Opportunity Zones without the incentive. This figure represents 21% of all annual investment in Opportunity Zone communities.
• Opportunity Zone investments have created at least 500,000 new jobs in designated Opportunity Zone tracts.
• From the second quarter of 2018 to the fourth quarter of 2019, private equity investments into Opportunity Zone businesses grew 29% relative to a comparable set of businesses not in Opportunity Zones.
• Investments in Opportunity Zones will lift approximately one million Americans from poverty. The poverty rate in Opportunity Zones will decrease by 11%.
• An Opportunity Zone designation alone has increased private property values within the designated areas by 1.1%. For the nearly half of Opportunity Zone residents who own their own homes, the increase provides an estimated $11 billion in new wealth.
Investing Federal Resources Into Opportunity Zones: Additionally, President Trump issued a new Executive Order (https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-targeting-opportunity-zones-distressed-communities-federal-site-locations/) that instructed Federal agencies to prioritize the location of facilities within distressed areas, including Opportunity Zones. Through this Order, the President is furthering his commitment to using the whole of the Government's resources to uplift distressed communities, while saving taxpayer dollars.
Additional Background: Opportunity Zones are economically distressed communities, defined by individual census tract, nominated by America's governors, and certified by the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury via his delegation of that authority to the Internal Revenue Service. Under certain conditions, new investments in Opportunity Zones may be eligible for preferential tax treatment. There are 8,764 Opportunity Zones in the United States, many of which have experienced a lack of investment for decades. The Opportunity Zones initiative is not a top-down government program from Washington but an incentive to spur private and public investment in America's underserved communities.

08/27/2020:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2020/pr20-134.cfm,FHA Extends Foreclosure and Eviction Moratorium for Homeowners Through Year End,"WASHINGTON - Today, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) announced the third extension of its foreclosure and eviction moratorium through December 31, 2020, for homeowners with FHA-insured single family mortgages covered under the Coronavirus Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act. This extension provides an additional four months of housing security to homeowners, as they will not fear losing their homes as they work to recover financially from the adverse impacts of the pandemic. With this third extension, FHA has now provided more than nine months of foreclosure and eviction relief to FHA-insured homeowners.
""President Trump is taking unprecedented measures to ensure American homeowners have the resources and support they need to get back to financial stability during the economic recovery,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""Because homeownership is the largest wealth builder for the majority of the nation's families, providing relief from foreclosure and eviction to those who are in jeopardy of losing their hard-earned wealth, through no fault of their own, is a priority.""
FHA's Single Family foreclosure and eviction moratorium has been in place since March 18, 2020, and continues to apply to homeowners with FHA-insured Title II Single Family forward and Home Equity Conversion (reverse) mortgages.
""For so many first-time homebuyers and others who relied on FHA insurance to achieve homeownership, this extension provides an additional measure of peace-of-mind and security, along with the fact that we do not require a lump sum payment at the end of any forbearance period,"" said Assistant Secretary for Housing and Federal Housing Commissioner Dana Wade. ""Right now, it's important that those affected by COVID-19 focus on the immediate priorities of regaining their financial footing, without the additional stress of dealing with a foreclosure action.""
The moratorium continues to direct mortgage servicers to:
Halt all new foreclosure actions and suspend all foreclosure actions currently in process for FHA-insured single family properties, excluding legally vacant or abandoned properties; and Cease all evictions of persons from FHA-insured single family properties, excluding actions to evict occupants of legally vacant or abandoned properties.
• Halt all new foreclosure actions and suspend all foreclosure actions currently in process for FHA-insured single family properties, excluding legally vacant or abandoned properties; and
• Cease all evictions of persons from FHA-insured single family properties, excluding actions to evict occupants of legally vacant or abandoned properties.
Homeowners with FHA-insured mortgages should continue to make their mortgage payments during the foreclosure and eviction moratorium if they are able to do so, or seek mortgage payment forbearance pursuant to the CARES Act from their mortgage servicer, if needed.
Pursuant to the CARES Act, FHA requires mortgage servicers to:
Offer borrowers with FHA-insured mortgages delayed mortgage payment forbearance when the borrower requests it, with the option to extend the forbearance for up to a year. FHA does not require a lump sum payment at the end of the forbearance period. Assess borrowers who receive COVID-19 forbearance for its special COVID-19 National Emergency Standalone Partial Claim before the end of the forbearance period. The COVID-19 National Emergency Standalone Partial Claim puts all deferred mortgage payment amounts owed into a junior lien which is only repaid when the borrower sells the home, refinances the mortgage, or the mortgage is otherwise extinguished. Assess borrowers who are not eligible for the COVID-19 National Emergency Standalone Partial Claim for one of FHA's COVID-19 expanded home retention solutions announced on July 8, 2020.

Background:
On June 25, 2019, President Donald Trump signed an Executive Order establishing (https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-establishing-white-house-council-eliminating-regulatory-barriers-affordable-housing/) the White House Council on Eliminating Barriers to Affordable Housing, and named Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson as its chairperson. The Council consists of members across eight Federal agencies and engage with State, local, and tribal leaders across the country to identify and remove the obstacles that impede the production of affordable homes - namely, the enormous price tag that follow burdensome government regulations.
Research indicates that more than 25% of the cost of a new home is the direct result of Federal, State, and local regulations. For this reason, in recent years, the construction of new multifamily and single-family dwellings has not kept pace with the formation of new households. Census Bureau data indicates that from 2010 to 2016, only seven homes were built for every 10 households formed. As a result, Americans have fewer housing opportunities, including the opportunity to achieve sustainable homeownership, which is the number one builder of wealth for most American families."

MTW allows public housing agencies (PHAs) to practice greater program flexibility and encourages housing choice and self-sufficiency among low-income families. Read the notice here (www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/08/28/2020-18152/operations-notice-for-the-expansion-of-the-moving-to-work-demonstration-program).
""We've seen that giving Housing Authorities flexibilities to care for their vulnerable populations under the Moving to Work Demonstration has led to excellent results for low-income families,"" said Secretary Ben Carson. ""Today we are pleased to invite additional Housing Authorities to join in on this program and replicate the successes we've seen across the country.""
""We are pleased the Department has moved forward on the MTW Expansion, and look forward to the next steps,"" said Tim Kaiser, the Executive Director of PHADA. ""Local decision making and flexibility to respond to local conditions allow public housing agencies to be more effective given their unique local conditions. MTW offers that flexibility, and we hope future cohorts will have more of the flexibility provided to the original 39 MTW agencies.""
""The MTW demonstration provides PHAs with the opportunity to create and test innovative, locally designed strategies to assist families in finding employment and achieving self-sufficiency,"" said Hunter Kurtz, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing. ""The demonstration strives to increase housing choices for low-incomes families and use federal funds in a more cost-effective way. MTW helps local communities leverage their strengths, resources, and partnerships to ensure they continue meeting the needs of the families they serve.""
Currently, there are 39 MTW PHAs throughout the nation. In 2015, Congress allowed HUD to expand the MTW demonstration program to 100 additional PHAs by 2022. With the publication of the final MTW Operations Notice, HUD can now invite eligible PHAs to submit complete applications under the first two cohorts of the MTW expansion. Future cohorts will be announced in the near future.
HUD's MTW demonstration program encourages PHAs to develop unique self-sufficiency strategies, tailored to the needs of their local communities. These locally designed strategies will improve upon the one-size-fits-all approach. In contrast to traditional PHAs, MTW agencies have flexibility to design and implement the Housing Choice Vouchers (HCVs) and public housing programs to better benefit the communities they serve. MTW PHAs can also streamline administrative procedures and enjoy greater financial flexibilities to run a more efficient and cost-effective operation.
One hundred MTW PHAs will be added in five cohorts. Each cohort will experiment with a certain affordable housing policy, and HUD will study that policy change to learn what successful MTW innovations should be applied to all PHAs across the nation.
Interested agencies should consider the types of policies they would like to implement as part of the demonstration program. Examples of policies that have been implemented by agencies can be found in the MTW Plans and Reports on HUD's website."
09/15/2020:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2020/pr20-146.cfm,HUD Secretary Ben Carson and Attorney General William Barr Visit Opportunity Zone Project in Wilmington,"WILMINGTON, DE - U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson and U.S. Attorney General William Barr yesterday traveled to Wilmington to tour Second Chances Farm, which is located in an Opportunity Zone. The Secretary and Attorney General held a roundtable with the organization's leadership and employees to discuss the work of the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council (https://opportunityzones.hud.gov/thecouncil) and the Federal Interagency Council on Reentry (www.justice.gov/archives/reentry/federal-interagency-reentry-council). Second Chances Farm (SCF) is the first commercial, indoor, hydroponic, vertical farm in Delaware and one of the leading Smart Farms in the United States. SCF is a public benefit corporation, certified minority enterprise, a qualified opportunity fund, and a Foreign Trade Zone. SCF hires people who were formerly incarcerated in federal or state prisons and provides them with mentorship and green-collar jobs.
""Opportunity Zones were created to serve as a path forward for our nation's vulnerable communities,"" said Secretary Carson. ""Yesterday, I visited Second Chances Farm, a Delaware Opportunity Zone project, which provides locally grown food to its community and jobs to former inmates. Second Chances Farm is not only proof that Opportunity Zones are thriving, but that President Trump's policies are having a positive impact on America's forgotten men and women.""
""One key component of the Department's work is implementing the Trump Administration's landmark First Step Act. The Department has undertaken a number of measures to prepare inmates still incarcerated for more productive releases in the future,"" said Attorney General William P. Barr. ""It is reentry programs like Second Chances Farms that help in the effort to reduce crime. If we give individuals the tools and support necessary to be successful members in their community, we not only keep our communities safer, we can save the life of the person who once turned to crime to address his or her problems.""
Background:
The White House Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) last month delivered a Progress Report (https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Impact-of-Opportunity-Zones-An-Initial-Assessment.pdf) on President Trump's Opportunity Zones initiative to White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council Chairman Dr. Ben Carson, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The CEA estimates that Opportunity Zones have already generated approximately half a million jobs, attracted $75 billion in capital investments, and are on track to reduce the poverty rate in Opportunity Zones by 11 percent - lifting 1,000,000 people out of poverty.
President Trump signed the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, creating Opportunity Zones to stimulate long-term investments in low-income communities. Opportunity Zones offer capital gains tax relief to those who invest in these distressed areas. This initiative is anticipated to spur $100 billion in private capital investment in Opportunity Zones. Incentivizing investment in low-income communities fosters economic revitalization, job creation, and promotes sustainable economic growth across the nation, especially in communities HUD serves. Read more about Opportunity Zones (www.irs.gov/newsroom/tax-reform-creates-opportunity-zone-tax-incentive).
Opportunity Zones are a powerful vehicle for bringing economic growth and job creation to the American communities that need it the most. On average, the median family income in an Opportunity Zone is 37 percent below its respective state median. Overall, more than 8,700 communities in all 50 States, Washington D.C., and five U.S. territories have been designated as Opportunity Zones. Nearly 35 million Americans live in communities designated as Opportunity Zones."
09/16/2020:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2020/pr20-147.cfm,HUD and Census Bureau Release New American Housing Survey,"WASHINGTON - According to the new 2019 American Housing Survey (AHS) released today by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Census Bureau, the percentage of American renter households spending 30 percent or more of their income on housing costs held steady at 51 percent between 2017 and 2019.
The 2019 AHS offers the most comprehensive picture of the nation's housing inventory pre-pandemic. As researchers try to understand more current data on the state of housing from multiple data sources, the new survey informs our understanding of how the current housing challenges relate to the housing challenges pre-pandemic.
The survey also included questions on food security, marking the second time in four years this type of data was collected and making it possible to track changes in food security. For instance, about 85 percent of households indicated they had high food security in 2019 compared to 82 percent in 2015.
""The new American Housing Survey data show clear improvements in food security between 2015 and 2019. Our hope is that the new 2019 American Housing Survey food security estimates can serve as a baseline for which to assess how American households are currently coping with the economic impacts of COVID-related job losses, which interrupted a historic period of economic growth and opportunity,"" said Seth Appleton, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research.
The survey also provides detailed information on the accessibility of housing for persons with disabilities. Of the 126 million households in America, nearly 16 million include at least one person who uses a wheelchair, walker, or other mobility devices. For the nearly 16 million households with at least one member using a mobility device, nearly 56 percent report their current home layout meets their accessibility needs ""very well,"" while more than 4 percent reported their home did not meet their accessibility needs. More than 4.2 million households reported at least one member had difficulty entering the home or apartment building and 3.2 million households reported at least one member had difficulty using the kitchen.
The 2019 American Housing Survey data show that nearly 3.5 million homeowners plan to make home improvements to improve the accessibility of their homes.
""As the population grows older, it is important to address their needs, including home modifications to improve accessibility. This new American Housing Survey data reveal that millions of households may benefit from accessibility improvements,"" says Appleton, who also notes that home modifications are an activity frequently undertaken by local governments using HUD grant funds.
The American Housing Survey is funded by HUD and data is collected every other year by the Census Bureau. The American Housing Survey is the most comprehensive housing survey in the United States, covering topics such as housing quality, housing costs, home improvements and neighborhood characteristics. Today's release includes summary tables (www.census.gov/programs-surveys/ahs/data/interactive/ahstablecreator.html) for the nation, for the 15 largest metropolitan areas, 9 states, and 10 additional large metropolitan areas. The microdata records will be released at the end of September.

Secretary Ben Carson and Senator David Perdue tour the Russell Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship. View additional pictures via Secretary Carson's Twitter page here (https://twitter.com/SecretaryCarson).
""There are 26 Opportunity Zones right here in Atlanta, home to more than 85,000 people,"" said Secretary Ben Carson. ""Organizations like the Russell Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship has been one of the driving forces for future Black leaders to help break the poverty cycle. From day one of his Administration President Trump promised to be a champion for our forgotten men and women of America, and I am proud to report that promise is being kept.""
""Working with President Trump, we created federal Opportunity Zones to drive private investment into underserved communities,"" said Senator Perdue. ""Our goal was to revitalize distressed areas by creating financial incentives and allowing the free-enterprise system to work. These efforts are making a real difference in our state. Georgia's 260 Opportunity Zones have attracted new investment, created quality jobs, and lifted people from poverty. The Russell Center, located in the heart of an Opportunity Zone, has proven to be a tremendous resource for Black entrepreneurs, and I share their commitment to helping all Georgians succeed.""
The Russell Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship describes itself as ""part incubator, part accelerator, part innovation lab and even part museum"" that offers ""access to place and space, resources, networks, mentorship, technical assistance and education,"" for African American entrepreneurs. In 2019, EDA awarded the RCIE a $1.2 million grant to expand, building on an earlier EDA grant that helped convert a former 43,000-square-foot corporate headquarters into a space for 100 emerging entrepreneurial companies. RCIE will feature programming that pays homage to the legacy of Herman Russell, while promoting a citywide and national dialogue around innovation, start-ups and venture capital. In other words, RCIE is a high-energy, inclusive community with lab-to-market resources for emerging industries that will drive real diversity, inspiration and collaboration among Atlanta's thought leaders.

The Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly program helps expand the supply of affordable housing with supportive services for the elderly. It provides very low-income elderly with options that allow them to live independently but in an environment that provides support for activities such as cleaning, cooking, and transportation.
Background:
Under the Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly program, HUD provides capital advances to finance the construction, rehabilitation or acquisition with or without rehabilitation of structures that will serve as supportive housing for very low-income elderly persons, including the frail elderly, and provides rent subsidies for the projects to help make them affordable.
HUD provides interest-free capital advances to private, nonprofit sponsors to finance the development of supportive housing for the elderly. The capital advance does not have to be repaid as long as the project serves very low-income elderly persons for 40 years.
Project rental assistance funds are provided to cover the difference between the HUD-approved operating cost for the project and the tenants' contribution towards rent. Project rental assistance contracts are approved initially for 3 years and are renewable based on the availability of funds.

Background:
On June 25, 2019, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order establishing (https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-establishing-white-house-council-eliminating-regulatory-barriers-affordable-housing/) the White House Council on Eliminating Barriers to Affordable Housing, and named Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson as its chairperson. The Council consists of members across eight Federal agencies and engage with state, local, and tribal leaders across the country to identify and remove the obstacles that impede the production of affordable homes – namely, the enormous price tag that follow burdensome government regulations.
Research indicates that more than 25% of the cost of a new home is the direct result of federal, state, and local regulations. For this reason, in recent years, the construction of new multifamily and single-family dwellings has not kept pace with the formation of new households. Census Bureau data indicates that from 2010 to 2016, only seven homes were built for every 10 households formed. As a result, Americans have fewer housing opportunities, including the opportunity to achieve sustainable homeownership, which is the number one builder of wealth for most American families."

The changes in the final rule improve the effectiveness of Section 3, streamline some processes that have not yielded significant benefits, and encourage PHAs and HUD grantees to focus on sustained employment for low- and very low-income individuals. Key changes in the rule and in HUD's implementation include:
Focusing on key outcome metrics, such as the sustained employment of individuals in targeted populations. Crediting retention of low- and very low-income employees and successful sustained employment in the reporting metrics. Aligning Section 3 reporting with standard business practices and payroll tracking methods. Allowing for tailored outcome benchmarks for different geographies and/or different projects.

WASHINGTON - U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson today launched a series of virtual workshops for faith congregations entitled, ""The Mustard Seed Series"". The virtual events will feature faith organizations that have successfully created affordable housing, reduced homelessness, or used innovative housing models to serve individuals in need.

Today's inaugural event focused on the partnership between the Grove Community Church and Mayor Rusty Bailey's administration in Riverside, California. Secretary Carson visited the church property in Riverside earlier in the year and saw the homes for low-income families built on the church property. The development was made possible by collaboration between the city and the church.

The goal of the model is self-sufficiency for the families, so they can move to their own homes one day and more vulnerable populations can be served through the facility.
""We cannot alleviate poverty through the efforts of the federal government alone,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""There are so many faith-based organizations serving vulnerable communities successfully, and we want to share these successes with other faith-based organizations who are already so dedicated to a posture of service. Our goal with the 'Mustard Seed Series' is to pair congregations interested in launching a housing outreach program with congregations already operating one so they can mentor each other and share best practices.""
""The collaboration between the City of Riverside and The Grove Community Church shows that church and state can work together to solve a societal problem,"" said Andy Gibeault, who serves as the Associate Pastor at the Grove Community Church.

Housing improvements help prevent injuries and illnesses, reduce associated health care and social services costs, reduce absentee rates for children in school and adults at work, and reduce stress, all which help to improve the quality of life.
HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes promotes local efforts to eliminate dangerous lead paint and other housing-related health hazards from lower income homes; stimulate private sector investment in lead hazard control; supports cutting-edge research on methods for assessing and controlling housing-related health and safety hazards; and educates the public about the dangers of hazards in the home.

""Given the program's success over the past year, we are pleased to announce today an expansion of the FYI initiative. This expansion will create new opportunities for communities to leverage this resource and empower the next generation to pave their own way.""
""Rarely do programs have an immediate and positive impact on the lives of so many,"" said Assistant Secretary Hunter Kurtz. ""This program did and continues to have impact by ensuring that young adults across the nation will have access to one of the most basic needs, a place to call home.""
Since the initiative was launched in June of 2019, 31 states and 91 Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) have received FYI funding, totaling over $6.8 million in funds to prevent or end homelessness among young adults under the age of 25 who are in, or have recently left, the foster care system without a home to go to. Since the first round of awards in October of 2019, the FYI program has expanded by 25 states.
Through a new notice made available today, HUD is announcing an expansion of the FYI initiative while also creating new opportunities for communities to leverage this resource. Specifically, the new notice makes several changes that HUD hopes will increase participation in the FYI Initiative, including:
• Open up the opportunity to request vouchers to every public housing agency (PHA) that administers an HCV program, include those PHAs that have a 90% utilization rate of their FUP program.
• Increase the maximum award to a maximum cap of 50 vouchers per fiscal year for those PHAs that have an FYI voucher utilization rate of 90% or greater.
• Recognize the importance of community partners by encouraging partnerships with state, local, philanthropic, or faith-based organizations as well as Continuum or Cares (CoCs).
• Allow PHAs to request funding on a rolling basis to the extent funding remains available.
The initiative uses the framework of the Family Unification Program (FUP), The primary goals of the program are:
• Address gaps in the availability of FUP for youth in communities that do not administer the FUP or do not have sufficient FUP resources to meet the needs to both unify child-welfare involved families and end homelessness for foster youth.
• Contribute to the goal of ending youth homelessness as outlined in Home, Together: The Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness. Former foster youth are at high risk of experiencing homelessness.
• Set youth on a path to self-sufficiency by providing a suite of supportive services for the duration of a youth's 36 months of assistance on the program.
Background: The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) estimates that more than 20,000 young people age out of foster care each year. The National Center for Housing and Child Welfare (NCHCW) estimates that approximately 25% of these young people experience homelessness within four years of leaving foster care and an even higher share are precariously housed. To be eligible for FYI funding, public housing authorities must:
Administer a Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) Program; Enter into a partnership agreement with a Public Child Welfare Agency (PCWA); Accept young people referred by their partnering PCWA; and Determine that the referred youth are eligible for HCV assistance.

10/07/2020:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2020/pr20-168.cfm,"HUD Charges City of Arlington, Texas, with Discriminating Against Families with Children","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is charging the city of Arlington, Texas, with violating the Fair Housing Act by refusing to approve proposals for affordable housing unless limited to elderly residents. In adopting this policy, city officials allegedly made statements indicating that they considered residents with children to be problematic. HUD's Charge arose from a complaint filed with the Department by a developer whose proposal to construct nearly a hundred non-age restricted units of affordable housing was blocked because of the city's policy. Read HUD's Charge.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination, including in government policies, that makes housing unavailable because families have children.
""Policies that prevent the creation of housing that families with children need are not only unlawful, they make it even more difficult for them to find decent, affordable places to call home,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Today's action reaffirms HUD's ongoing commitment to addressing discriminatory practices that violate the nation's housing laws.""
""HUD will continue to enforce the Fair Housing Act to ensure that discriminatory policies do not interfere with the construction of affordable housing for families with children,"" said Michael B. Williams, HUD's Principal Deputy General Counsel.
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he or she may award damages to the complainant for harm caused by the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney's fees. In addition, the judge may impose fines to vindicate the public interest. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages.
Persons who believe they have experienced housing discrimination may file a complaint of discrimination by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 or visiting How to File a Complaint on HUD's website. Materials and assistance are available for persons with limited English proficiency. Individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing may contact the Department using the Federal Relay Service at (800) 877-8339."
10/07/2020:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2020/pr20-169.cfm,HUD Charges New York Condo Association with Discriminating Against Tenant with Disabilities,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced today that it is charging Fairfield Properties and Pinewood Estates at Commack Condominium in Commack, New York, for allegedly discriminating against a tenant with disabilities. Specifically, HUD's Charge alleges that the housing providers refused to allow a tenant with disabilities to keep an assistance animal. Read HUD's Charge.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing discrimination based on disabilities including denying reasonable accommodation requests.
""Assistance animals aren't pets; they make it easier for persons with disabilities to perform life's daily functions,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will continue to take action when the practices and policies of housing providers violate the nation's housing laws.""
""HUD is committed to ensuring housing is accessible to individuals with disabilities,"" said HUD's Principal Deputy General Counsel, Michael B. Williams. ""Providing reasonable accommodations is an essential part of housing providers' legal obligation to make housing available to persons with disabilities.""
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he or she may award damages to the family for harm caused by the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney's fees. In addition, the judge may impose fines to vindicate the public interest. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages.

10/09/2020:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2020/pr20-170.cfm,Secretary Investigates Alleged Religious Discrimination in Senior Housing Complexes,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson announced last night he has initiated a Complaint against the owner and manager of senior apartments in Oklahoma for violating the Fair Housing Act by removing Bibles and Christian reading material from the common areas. The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in housing and in housing-related services based on religion and other protected characteristics.
""Religious liberty is at the core of our Nation's identity and will be upheld under the Fair Housing Act,"" said Secretary Carson. ""Barring religious materials infringes upon this right, and the Trump Administration will not stand for discrimination against any group for practicing their religious traditions.""
Secretary Carson received a letter from a resident at the Carriage Crossing apartment complex who was upset that the management demanded the removal of religious reading material from the common areas and angel ornaments from the complex's Christmas tree. Vintage Housing, Inc. owns the two properties at issue.
Wilhoit Properties, Inc., also named in Secretary Carson's complaint and investigation, manages both Cardinal Heights Apartments and Carriage Crossing, as well as more than 200 properties in 16 states. The subject properties are limited to persons age 62 and over. Going forward, the investigation will seek to determine if HUD has reasonable cause to believe the owner and manager discriminated based on religion.
HUD Secretary-Initiated Complaints
The Secretary of HUD may file a fair housing complaint against those whom the Department believes may be in violation of the Fair Housing Act. Secretary-Initiated Complaints are appropriate in cases, among others, involving significant issues that are national in scope or when the Department is made aware of potential violations of the Act and broad public interest relief is warranted. A Fair Housing Act complaint, including a Secretary initiated complaint, is not a determination of liability.
A Secretary-Initiated Complaint will result in a formal fact-finding investigation. The party against whom the complaint is filed will be provided notice and an opportunity to respond. If HUD's investigation results in a determination that reasonable cause exists that there has been a violation of the Fair Housing Act, a charge of discrimination may be filed. Throughout the process, HUD will seek conciliation and voluntary resolution. If a charge is filed, it may be resolved through settlement, an administrative determination or referral to the Department of Justice.
Persons who believe they have experienced discrimination in housing because of race, color, religion, sex, disability, familial status or national origin may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY).
Secretary Carson's Fair Housing Record
Taking on Big Tech: Under the leadership of Secretary Carson, HUD charged Facebook with violating the Fair Housing Act, alleging that Facebook unlawfully restricted who can view housing-related ads based on race, color, national origin, religion, familial status, sex, and disability. As alleged in HUD's charge, Facebook has approximately 221 million active users in the United States and is the second largest online advertiser nationwide. HUD has also been engaged with other platforms to improve their policies and practices for housing-related advertisements.
Clearing Backlog of Fair Housing Complaints: Since January 2017, HUD and its Fair Housing Assistance Program (FHAP) partners have worked diligently to investigate fair housing complaints and achieve appropriate resolution based on the facts of each case, which had a disappointingly long backlog prior to the Secretary's arrival. From January 2017 to present, we have successfully resolved 22,933 cases.
Ensuring Accessible Housing: Entered into a landmark voluntary compliance agreement with the City of Los Angeles to provide accessibility improvements. The unprecedented settlement anticipates 10,000 new units of affordable housing over the next ten years, including 1,500 accessible units for individuals with disabilities, and a commitment to provide 3,100 accessible housing units by retrofitting existing housing."

The FHA Catalyst: Multifamily Applications module will allow eligible Multifamily lenders to electronically submit applications for FHA insurance on multifamily properties. The new capability supports lenders in providing FHA-insured mortgage financing while working remotely because of the COVID-19 National Emergency.
Multifamily lenders currently submit insurance applications - usually hundreds of pages - to FHA via stand-alone media such as USB flash drives, with hard copies of these applications submitted as follow-up. Through FHA Catalyst, Multifamily lenders participating in FHA's Multifamily Accelerated Processing (MAP) program can now choose to use the module to electronically submit insurance applications in a simplified, streamlined, and secure manner, and without the need for paper submissions.
""This technology will eliminate time-consuming process steps, so that Multifamily lenders and FHA can remain focused on providing safe and affordable rental housing for the nation,"" said Assistant Secretary for Housing and Federal Housing Commissioner Dana Wade. ""Our highest priority is to safeguard residents in our insured and assisted Multifamily properties, while also ensuring that FHA-insured multifamily mortgage financing continues during these times.""
Multifamily MAP lenders may choose to use the module for application submissions following a short setup process. More information on the setup process can be found on the FHA Catalyst: Multifamily Applications module web page. FHA intends to further expand FHA Catalyst capabilities in the future to allow for the electronic submission of other documents required for FHA-insured Multifamily properties.
FHA Catalyst, FHA's multi-year technology modernization initiative, is a secure, flexible, cloud-based platform that will provide a modern, automated system for use by lenders, servicers, and other FHA program participants, while enabling FHA to more efficiently and effectively manage risk, and its programs and processes. Today, FHA program participants are actively using FHA Catalyst technology for digital submission of Single Family case binders, appraisals, and many Single Family insurance claims.

10/14/2020:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2020/pr20-173.cfm,HUD Secretary Ben Carson Tours Opportunity Zone Project in Cleveland,"CLEVELAND, OH - U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson today toured an Opportunity Zone redevelopment project in Cleveland. Funded with Qualified Opportunity Funds and additional Opportunity Zone investments, The Tappan is a mixed-use, mixed-income apartment building with a 2,000-square foot bakery occupied by a first-time business owner.
The 95-unit apartment building has set aside 60 percent of units as workforce housing. The redevelopment has created 100 construction jobs and will create up to 25 new permanent jobs. The Tappan was featured in the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council's Best Practices Report to the President (https://opportunityzones.hud.gov/sites/opportunityzones.hud.gov/files/documents/OZ_Best_Practices_Report.pdf).
""Opportunity Zones are a powerful initiative to support the forgotten men and women of America by uplifting distressed communities,"" said Secretary Ben Carson. ""Today, I visited The Tappan in Cleveland, which has led the way with an impressive Opportunity Zone project, not long after the incentive was created. I appreciate their commitment to providing workforce housing so teachers, nurses, police officers and firefighters can afford to live near the communities they serve.""
Background:
The White House Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) last month delivered a Progress Report (https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Impact-of-Opportunity-Zones-An-Initial-Assessment.pdf) on President Trump's Opportunity Zones initiative to White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council Chairman Dr. Ben Carson, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The CEA estimates that Opportunity Zones have already generated approximately half a million jobs, attracted $75 billion in capital investments, and are on track to reduce the poverty rate in Opportunity Zones by 11 percent - lifting 1,000,000 people out of poverty.
President Trump signed the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, creating Opportunity Zones to stimulate long-term investments in low-income communities. Opportunity Zones offer capital gains tax relief to those who invest in these distressed areas. This initiative is anticipated to spur $100 billion in private capital investment in Opportunity Zones. Incentivizing investment in low-income communities fosters economic revitalization, job creation, and promotes sustainable economic growth across the nation, especially in communities HUD serves. Read more about Opportunity Zones (www.irs.gov/newsroom/tax-reform-creates-opportunity-zone-tax-incentive).
Opportunity Zones are a powerful vehicle for bringing economic growth and job creation to the American communities that need it the most. On average, the median family income in an Opportunity Zone is 37 percent below its respective state median. Overall, more than 8,700 communities in all 50 States, Washington D.C., and five U.S. territories have been designated as Opportunity Zones. Nearly 35 million Americans live in communities designated as Opportunity Zones."

Homeowners experiencing a financial hardship as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic may now request an initial forbearance through the end of this year, December 31, 2020. Previously, homeowners with FHA-insured mortgages needing assistance had until October 30, 2020, to request a COVID-19 forbearance from their mortgage servicer.
""Since day one President Trump has made it clear that no American should fear losing their home in the midst of this pandemic,"" said Secretary Carson. ""Today's forbearance request extension for single family homeowners further solidifies that commitment. I can't stress enough that this relief should be reserved for those that need it most. Americans who are capable of paying their mortgage on time should do so. The great American come back is in full force – if we work together, we can achieve and even surpass the economic prosperity we saw prior to the pandemic.""
FHA requires mortgage servicers to provide up to six months of COVID-19 forbearance when a homeowner requests this assistance, and up to an additional six months of forbearance for homeowners who request an extension of the initial forbearance. Homeowners needing assistance must engage with their servicer to obtain an initial forbearance or to obtain an extension of the initial forbearance.
""By providing this important extension, FHA seeks to assist those struggling with the continued financial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic,"" said Assistant Secretary for Housing and Federal Housing Commissioner Dana Wade. ""Our goal is to make sure that no homeowner loses their home unnecessarily as a result of this pandemic.""
""It's always in a homeowner's best interest to make their mortgage payments if they are able. But for those who are struggling right now, we urge them to engage with their servicer immediately. And, if your servicer contacts you, it is crucial that you respond to them to let them know if you need assistance,"" said Deputy Assistant Secretary for Single Family Housing Joe Gormley. ""The last thing FHA wants is for any homeowner to risk losing their homeownership investment if they are eligible for assistance.""
FHA requires mortgage servicers to:
Offer homeowners with FHA-insured mortgages mortgage payment forbearance when the homeowner requests it, with the option to extend the forbearance for up to a year in total. FHA does not require a lump sum payment at the end of the forbearance period. Assess homeowners who receive COVID-19 forbearance for its special COVID-19 National Emergency Standalone Partial Claim before the end of the forbearance period. The COVID-19 National Emergency Standalone Partial Claim puts all suspended mortgage payment amounts owed into a junior lien, which is only repaid when the homeowner sells the home, refinances the mortgage, or the mortgage is otherwise extinguished. Assess homeowners who are not eligible for the COVID-19 National Emergency Standalone Partial Claim for one of FHA's COVID-19 expanded home retention solutions announced on July 8, 2020.

These supplemental grants will support quality housing counseling services, including the foreclosure avoidance and rental counseling services used by many families as they work to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.
The grants awarded today will directly support the housing counseling services provided by 219 HUD-approved local housing counseling agencies, national and regional organizations, and state housing finance agencies (SHFAs) who competed under HUD's FY 2020 Supplemental Comprehensive Housing Counseling Grant Notice of Funds Availability (NOFA) or HUD's FY 2019/2020 Comprehensive Housing Counseling NOFA.

HUD-approved housing counseling agencies provide services to address a full range of housing counseling needs. This includes assisting homebuyers in evaluating their readiness for a home purchase and navigating through the homebuying process. Nearly half of the state and local counseling agencies that were awarded HUD grants received preference because they will provide counseling to individuals and families within designated Opportunity Zones.
""Our hope is that those affected by the pandemic who need housing help will reach out to qualified housing counseling professionals to help them understand what their options are,"" said Assistant Secretary for Housing and Federal Housing Commissioner Dana Wade. ""The grants awarded today will help housing counseling agencies assist a greater number of clients who are seeking assistance.""
HUD-approved housing counseling agencies also help households find affordable rental housing, offer financial literacy training to individuals and families, and provide foreclosure prevention counseling. In addition to providing counseling to homeowners and renters, HUD-approved housing counseling agencies support emergency preparedness and disaster recovery efforts, assist homeless persons in finding transitional housing, and help seniors determine whether a reverse mortgage makes sense for them.
In Fiscal Year 2019, HUD-approved housing counseling agencies served 1,015,911 households. Approximately 52 percent of those households were minorities, including 38 percent who identified as African American, 19 percent who identified as Hispanic, and 10 percent who identified as multiple races.
There are many ways to locate a HUD-approved housing counseling agency. Visit HUD's website or call (800) 569-4287 for our interactive telephone directory.

This week, USICH unveiled a new strategic plan to reduce homelessness, ""Expanding the Toolbox: The Whole-of-Government Response to Homelessness"" (https://www.usich.gov/resources/uploads/asset_library/USICH-Expanding-the-Toolbox.pdf) which shares strategies to increase self-sufficiency by considering homelessness beyond a sole issue of housing and instead focusing on the root causes of homelessness for each individual and family experiencing homelessness.
""In a Nation as prosperous as ours, we can work together to lift our neighbors up off the streets and eradicate the threat of homelessness,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""Evidence shows us that current federal programs and policies intended to address homelessness need some serious improvement. The changes presented in the new USICH strategic plan should be implemented quickly so that we can reverse the trends we are seeing in homelessness across some American cities today and lead people back to self-sufficiency.""
""The status quo is not working, and homelessness is increasing across the board with many cities in crisis,"" said U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness Executive Director Dr. Robert Marbut. ""Real change needs to occur in order to truly reduce homelessness.""
""From the moment I sat down with Sec. Ben Carson in February to discuss the homeless crisis in Austin, I knew he cared deeply about helping the homeless and low-income families get on a path towards self-sufficiency,"" said Rep. Chip Roy. ""My hope is that today's conversation is the first step in bringing Austin and the greater Central Texas together to ensure all in our community have the tools and resources to succeed.""
The ""Expanding the Toolbox: The Whole-of-Government Response to Homelessness"" focuses on eight solutions:
The importance and power of the dignity of work Mental health and trauma informed care are critical Affordable construction leads to affordable housing Prevention will save money while reducing trauma The need for population specific programming Renewed focus on racial disparities Promote alternatives to criminalizing people experiencing homelessness Importance of national emergency readiness

10/27/2020:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2020/pr20-187.cfm,Historic North Carolina Hospital Earns 2020 HUD Secretary's Award,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) announced last week the Historic Ashe Hospital in Jefferson, North Carolina, was the recipient of the 2020 ACHP/HUD Secretary's Award for Excellence in Historic Preservation (www.huduser.gov/portal/about/HistoricPres-intro.html).
This annual award recognizes developers, organizations, and agencies for successfully advancing historic preservation, while providing affordable housing and/or expanding economic opportunities for low- and moderate-income families and individuals.
Historic Ashe Hospital, which dates back to the 1940s, reopened at the beginning of 2019 with 46 apartments, a mix of studio, one-, and two-bedroom units for low-income senior citizens and people with disabilities.
There are 19 units in the historic building and 27 in a new, complementary addition, along with a library, computer room, and three meeting rooms that are available to the community. The front lobby of the historic building features a memory room, displaying artifacts from the old hospital to tell its story.
""Historic Ashe Hospital is a prime example of the innovation that comes from public-private partnerships, not only preserving a historic structure but reutilizing it to create more affordable housing for seniors,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""This historic hospital holds a special place in the hearts of the Jefferson, NC community, and it will continue to serve its residents for years to come.""
""Historic Ashe Hospital has deep meaning to the surrounding residents. The whole community joined together to not only save it but utilize the space to provide much-needed affordable housing for senior citizens and those with disabilities,"" ACHP Chairman Aimee Jorjani said. ""Throughout the building, the project focused on retaining the historic touches and recognizing it was once a hospital. Many people, organizations, and government agencies saw the value of preserving Ashe Hospital and now, it has become a community gathering place and a home to dozens of people.""
Originally opened in 1941, Ashe Hospital was the first hospital in rural Appalachian Ashe County. The project was undertaken by the community utilizing the Works Progress Administration, an employment and infrastructure program created by President Franklin Roosevelt to help the country through the Great Depression. After a new hospital was built in 1971, the old hospital building eventually was abandoned and fell into disrepair. The community stepped up and saved the building, with the goal of utilizing the now-historic hospital as much-needed housing for senior citizens and people with disabilities.
The transformation of the hospital focused on historic preservation, sustainability, and the use of natural light. Wide hallways, tall ceilings, and large windows remind residents of great public spaces of the past. Windows, doors, and oak floors are original. The hallways look as they did when the hospital was first built; although, some of the interior doors no longer open to a room but remain to preserve the integrity of the original layout of the building.
The project worked to meet preservation guidelines by repairing rather than replacing existing historic windows, restoring exterior stonework, and preserving interior architectural features and finishes, such as baseboards, door casings, and corridor doors. The Section 106 review resulted in a finding of No Adverse Effect.
Funding for the development consisted of $5.5 million in private investment, 9 percent low-income housing tax credits, and federal and state historic tax credits. Government participation in the project's finance was provided by the North Carolina Housing Finance Agency, and HUD's Section 8 Project-Based Vouchers.
The partners who undertook the $9.1 million project, include Tise-Kiester Architects; Northwestern Housing Enterprises, Incorporated; ALH General Contractor; Northwestern Regional Housing Authority; RedStone Equity Partners, LLC; Bank of Tennessee; Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati; and North Carolina Housing Finance Agency."

The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is joining the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and additional partners, in highlighting this issue during National Lead Poisoning Prevention Week (NLPPW) 2020.
Lead poisoning is only detectable by blood testing and to create more awareness, NLPPW's main themes are: Get the Facts, Get Your Home Tested, and Get Your Child Tested.
""National Lead Poisoning Prevention Week is one of our most important educational campaigns,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""Many residents and maintenance workers don't know the risks when performing renovations and lead repair work in older homes. By providing families, public housing staff, contractors, and others with this basic information we can eliminate lead-related health hazards and protect American families.""
To help commemorate the week, the Federal partners released a comprehensive digital toolkit, in English and Spanish as well as a special webinar program with leading experts. The webinars include sessions on how to safely renovate and repair, and lead poisoning prevention efforts during COVID-19.
Lead can be found in many things, but the main hazard to young children is from lead paint hazards in homes built before 1978. Adults and children can become lead poisoned, but children experience a greater degree of harm due to their developing bodies and brains.
HUD and its partners are targeting their NLPPW outreach to broad audiences. These includes lead poisoning prevention and healthy homes advocates; state and local health, environmental health, and housing departments; building inspectors and code enforcement officers; lead hazard control grantees; university educators; and others. These stakeholders play a key role in helping to spread the word within their local communities, and taking steps aimed at lead poisoning prevention.

Read HUD's Order.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to deny housing or impose different rental terms and conditions based on disability, race, national origin, color, religion, sex, or familial status. It is illegal to refuse to provide a reasonable accommodation to a person with disabilities.
""The rights of persons with disabilities have been protected under the Fair Housing Act for more than 30 years, yet they continue to be subjected to discriminatory treatment,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will continue taking appropriate action when housing providers fail to meet their responsibilities to comply with the nation's housing laws.""
""Providing reasonable accommodations in accordance with the Fair Housing Act is an essential part of a housing provider's responsibilities,"" said Michael B.

Specifically, HUD's charge alleges that Housing Equality Center of Pennsylvania conducted testing concerning whether the owner and management company were rejecting reasonable accommodation requests, including requests for waivers of pet fees for assistance animals and for designated parking spaces. According to the Charge, HECP's testing revealed discrimination against persons with disabilities. Read HUD's Charge.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing discrimination based on disabilities, including denying reasonable accommodation requests for the waiver of pet fees for assistance animals and rejecting requests for a designated handicapped parking space needed by a person with a disability.
""Reasonable accommodations enable persons with disabilities to fully utilize and enjoy their homes and shouldn't be denied,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will continue taking action to protect their rights by ensuring that housing providers meet their obligations under the Fair Housing Act.""
""HUD will vigorously enforce the rights of persons with disabilities to receive the reasonable accommodations they need to enjoy their homes,"" said Michael B. Williams, HUD's Principal Deputy General Counsel.
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he or she may award damages to the complainants for harm caused by the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney's fees. In addition, the judge may impose fines to vindicate the public interest. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages.

11/10/2020:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2020/pr20-191.cfm,Federal Housing Administration Proposes Private Flood Insurance Option for Single Family Mortgages,"WASHINGTON - The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) today published a proposed rule on its website that highlights a proposal to allow a private flood insurance option instead of insurance through the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), when flood insurance is required by FHA.
The proposed changes would allow lenders to begin accepting private flood insurance policies for single family insured loans for homes located in Federal Emergency Management Agency-designated Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs), consistent with similar provisions in use by other industry participants.
""Our proposal would expand the options for obtaining flood insurance, rather than continuing to lock in borrowers to one federal option without any ability to comparison shop,"" said Assistant Secretary for Housing and Federal Housing Commissioner Dana Wade. ""We are also proposing important safeguards that will help protect borrowers, so their homes will have flood insurance coverage at a level at or above the level available through the National Flood Insurance Program.""
As part of the rule, FHA is also seeking public comment on a proposal to institute a compliance aid for private flood insurance policies. This would allow lenders to rely on the compliance aid to determine if a private flood insurance policy meets FHA's requirements. FHA anticipates between three and five percent of FHA borrowers could obtain a private flood insurance policy for their FHA-insured mortgage if this option becomes available.
""This proposal will remove yet another unnecessary regulatory barrier to doing business with FHA and can also reduce costs to the federal government-costs that are ultimately born by the taxpayer,"" said Deputy Assistant Secretary for Single Family Housing Joe Gormley. ""Allowing participation by private insurers should generate the competition needed to ultimately reduce costs for consumers.""
The proposed rule will be published in the Federal Register in the coming days and will provide for a 60-day public comment period following such publication. Comments should be submitted to FHA only through the methods specified in the notice to be published in the Federal Register. As this is a proposal only, FHA's current flood insurance policies remain unchanged at this time, including the requirement that minimum flood insurance be obtained through the NFIP."
11/12/2020:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2020/pr20-192.cfm,HUD's Rental Assistance Demonstration Generates More than $10 Billion in Construction Activity to Preserve Affordable Housing,"WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced a major milestone for the Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) program, which has now facilitated more than $10 billion in capital investment since the program's inception to improve or replace 140,000 public housing units - the majority of which house extremely low-income families, seniors, and persons with disabilities. Read more about RAD's $10 billion milestone.
Today, RAD is leveraging $12.57 for every dollar of public housing funding appropriated by Congress, significantly expanding the ability of local public housing authorities (PHAs) to improve their properties. Without RAD, it would take 34 years for housing authorities to accomplish the same level of repairs and renewal.
""With the support of the Trump Administration, we are committed to ensuring the most vulnerable Americans have access to housing options that are modern, dignified, and safe. Reaching this milestone showcases how powerful the RAD program is in helping public housing authorities to preserve and revitalize rental housing for the nation's low-income families,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson.
""RAD is a program that works, and this milestone is one more example of how federal dollars can be leveraged more effectively when paired with private funds to help the nation's communities and maximize taxpayer dollars,"" said Assistant Secretary for Housing and Federal Housing Administration Commissioner, Dana Wade.
Background on the RAD Program:
RAD allows public housing authorities (PHAs) to access private investment through public-private partnerships to help preserve and improve public housing properties and address the growing nationwide backlog maintenance, estimated at $50 billion. By stemming the loss of these units, RAD helps ensure more low-income families can secure quality, affordable housing.
Under RAD, PHAs convert some or all their developments to a project-based Section 8 platform. This change in regulatory platform allows public housing authorities to identify creative ways to solve their capital needs through public-private partnerships. The new, long-term Section 8 contracts that these properties transition to guarantee the units remain permanently affordable to low-income households. This model is proving to be a versatile tool for PHAs to preserve affordable housing, to serve more eligible households, and maximize the impact of the existing commitment of federal resources. While most conversions involve the modernization and stabilization of existing properties, many PHAs have demolished severely distressed properties and replace them with new, permanently affordable housing. PHAs are also using RAD to help families move from blighted or isolated locations to neighborhoods of greater opportunity where they will have better access to jobs, transportation, and good schools for their children. Read case studies where RAD is working to successfully preserve and improve public housing for low-income families.
Existing public housing residents benefit from a right of return under RAD, a prohibition against re-screening, and robust notification and relocation rights. Residents continue to pay 30 percent of their adjusted income towards the rent and maintain the same basic rights as they have in the public housing program. Residents also have the option to request tenant-based assistance if they wish to subsequently move from the property. RAD maintains public stewardship of the converted property through clear rules requiring ongoing ownership or control by a public or non-profit entity."
11/12/2020:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2020/pr20-193.cfm,HUD Strengthens Manufactured Housing Safety and Affordability with Revised Minimum Payments for State Oversight Programs,"WASHINGTON - The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) published today a final rule (www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/11/12/2020-24380/manufactured-housing-program-minimum-payments-to-the-states) in the Federal Register which provides a revised structure for the payments HUD makes to states participating as State Administrative Agencies in the manufactured housing program. State Administrative Agencies in 33 states are fully or conditionally approved to carry out their manufactured housing oversight programs, and the majority of these states will see an increase in payments to administer their programs under the revised payment structure.
""More than 22 million Americans have used manufactured homes as a means of attaining the stability and financial independence of homeownership, particularly in areas where housing affordability is a challenge. Making sure that states are appropriately compensated for the work they do to ensure the safety and affordability of these manufactured homes, for families within their own communities, is both right and responsible,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson.
The final rule revises the state payment formula contained in the Manufactured Home Procedural and Enforcement Regulations so that payments are more commensurate with both the level of manufactured housing production, and the associated work performed in a state when a manufactured home is first produced and then installed in its permanent location. HUD has increased production payments from the current $2.50 per section of home produced to $14.00 per section, while maintaining payments to states of $9.00 per section for manufactured home siting. Further, for the first time in two decades, states that have received conditional approval of their state programs from HUD are now eligible to receive fiscal year-end supplemental payments for the work they are performing.
""This is another example of HUD reducing barriers to the adoption of manufactured housing as an affordable housing alternative,"" said Assistant Secretary for Housing Dana Wade. ""States are valuable partners in this process. We believe this change will strengthen existing partnerships, incentivize more states to participate in the program, and reduce the reliance on federal resources for activities that are more appropriately handled at the state and local level.""
In conjunction with the final rule, today HUD also published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/11/12/2020-24382/manufactured-housing-program-minimum-payments-to-the-states-advanced-notice-of-proposed-rulemaking) to solicit public comment on additional refinements to state payments that HUD may consider in the future. The considerations include additional options to fund state participation in a way that recognizes the contributions each state makes, and to incentivize state participation in various elements of the manufactured housing program to the maximum extent possible. HUD also looks forward to feedback from the Manufactured Housing Consensus Committee, a Federal Advisory Committee, prior to issuing a proposed rule on these refinements.
HUD’s Office of Manufactured Housing Programs administers the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974 which authorizes HUD to establish federal standards for the design and construction of manufactured homes to assure quality, durability, safety, and affordability.

In addition to its emphasis on helping homeowners financially impacted by the COVID-19 global pandemic, in FY 2020 FHA also served a record number of its core mission demographic of first-time and minority homebuyers.
As the report illustrates, the MMI Fund achieved gains in its overall capital ratio, ending the fiscal year at 6.10 percent - an increase of 1.26 percentage points over FY 2019 and well above the Congressionally mandated 2.0 percent capital ratio. As forecasted, this level of capital will help FHA withstand the immediate financial impacts to the Fund of the COVID-19 pandemic without requiring additional assistance from taxpayers. The report also provides the data and rationale to support a prudent capital management strategy moving forward so the Fund can continue to withstand any future or protracted economic stress events.
""In a year like no other in recent memory, the Trump Administration's extraordinary response to COVID-19 paved the way for FHA to play a leading role in helping struggling families and the nation's housing market in FY 2020,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""At the same time, FHA successfully served more of the nation's first-time homebuyers and maintained its leadership role as the nation's largest facilitator of affordable mortgage financing for minority borrowers.""
""While we focused our efforts on helping FHA homeowners impacted by the global pandemic keep their homes, we balanced this with sound risk management to protect taxpayers,"" said Assistant Secretary for Housing and Federal Housing Commissioner Dana Wade. ""We also continue to demonstrate that during these times, FHA is open for business. As proof of this, we've exceeded expectations by bringing to market FHA Catalyst, a state-of-the-art technology platform that will keep credit flowing to FHA's core borrowers while providing us with the data and analytics we need to identify and manage risk.""
The MMI Fund supports FHA's Single Family mortgage insurance programs, including all forward mortgage purchase and refinance transactions, as well as mortgages insured since 2009 under the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) reverse mortgage program.
KEY HIGHLIGHTS FROM FHA'S FY 2020 MMI FUND ANNUAL REPORT
As of September 30, 2020, FHA had active insurance on more than 8.3 million single family forward and reverse mortgages, with a total unpaid principal balance of more than 1.29 trillion. FHA market share decreased from 11.56 percent in FY 2019 to 9.61 percent in FY 2020. The share of first-time homebuyers using FHA insurance reached a new high of 83.1 percent of total FHA forward mortgage purchase endorsements in FY 2020. Similarly, the share of mortgages insured by FHA to minority borrowers reached almost 33 percent of all FHA forward mortgage insurance endorsements in FY 2020. The combined capital ratio for FY 2020 was 6.10 percent, an increase of 1.26 percentage points over FY 2019's 4.84 percent capital ratio. The combined capital ratio is one indicator of the MMI Fund's financial health and includes both the FHA-insured single family forward and reverse mortgage portfolios. FHA's forward mortgage portfolio achieved solid performance with a stand-alone capital ratio of 6.31 percent as of September 30, 2020. While improved compared to last year, the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) reverse mortgage portfolio had a negative 0.78 percent capital ratio as of September 30, 2020. The forward mortgage portfolio continues to support the negative financial performance of the HECM portfolio. The HECM portfolio's future financial performance is highly sensitive to changes in House Price Appreciation and other economic factors.

The program was authorized by the SUPPORT Act to provide stable, temporary housing to individuals in recovery from a substance use disorder. RHP is funding 25 grantees, 24 states and the District of Columbia, whose age-adjusted rate of drug overdose deaths was above the national overdose mortality rate.
""As a Nation, we need to remove the stigma associated with substance-use disorder, make access to treatment as easy as access to drugs, and help the whole person,"" said Secretary Carson. ""HUD's Recovery Housing Program is bringing new funding and new partners to the fight against the opioid crisis, broadening the spectrum of collaboration among federal, state and local governments and nonprofits and faith-based communities.""
""HUD is proud to support those doing the good work of helping Americans battling with substance use disorder get on the road to recovery, by providing housing - a critical need for those in recovery,"" said Assistant Secretary Gibbs.
The RHP Notice provides state grantees the flexibility to carry out activities directly or pass funds through to local governments in rural and urban areas throughout the state. Therefore, grantees can streamline the use of RHP funds, particularly by nonprofits and other subrecipients that currently administer residential programs for persons in recovery from a substance use disorder.
HUD encourages RHP grantees to coordinate with other federal and non-federal assistance related to treating substance use disorder, homelessness and those at-risk of homelessness, employment programs, and other wraparound services. Grantees will be able to target RHP funds towards projects that complement (but do not supplant) federal substance use disorder-related assistance, such as State Opioid Response Grants or Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grants awarded by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Additionally, HUD is encouraging grantees to partner with other programs that may be assisting these same individuals either before or after their participation in an RHP-funded program, such as HUD's Continuum of Care Program, Emergency Solutions Grants program, Housing Opportunities for Persons With AIDS Program, and also HUD-VASH, a joint program between HUD and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.

The capital advance awards will support integrated affordable housing by providing funding for the development of permanent supportive rental housing through HUD’s Section 811 Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities program, while project rental assistance awards are used to subsidize rents for extremely low-income persons with disabilities.
""HUD is committed to helping very low-income persons with disabilities with housing options that provide meaningful choices about housing, health care, and long-term services and support so they can participate fully in community life,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""The Trump Administration has strongly supported our efforts to serve this population, including supporting the almost $150 million in HUD grants, and making $15 million in supplemental funds available under the CARES Act to help prevent, prepare for, and respond to COVID-19.""
The grants were awarded to organizations who will create permanent supportive housing models that will be at the forefront of design, service delivery and efficient use of federal resources. Awardees must promote long-term housing security and facilitate community integration of persons with disabilities.

12/02/2020:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2020/pr20-201.cfm,FHA Announces New Single Family Loan Limits for 2021,"WASHINGTON - The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) today announced the agency's new schedule of loan limits for calendar year 2021 for its Single Family Title II forward and Home Equity Conversion (reverse) Mortgage insurance programs. Loan limits for most of the country will increase in the coming year resulting from robust house price appreciation, which is factored into the statutorily mandated calculations FHA uses as part of its methodology for determining the limits each year. The new loan limits are effective for FHA case numbers assigned on or after January 1, 2021.
Read FHA's Mortgagee Letter on 2021 Forward Mortgage Limits. Read FHA's Mortgagee Letter on 2021 Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) Limits.
• Read FHA's Mortgagee Letter on 2021 Forward Mortgage Limits.
• Read FHA's Mortgagee Letter on 2021 Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) Limits.
FHA is required by the National Housing Act, as amended by the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA), to set Single Family forward loan limits at 115 percent of area median house prices, subject to a floor and a ceiling on the limits. FHA calculates forward mortgage limits by Metropolitan Statistical Area and county.
""FHA has seen consistent increases in loan limits during the past few years, putting it in a position to serve a segment of borrowers that may be better-served by the conventional market. FHA's mission is to support low-to-moderate income borrowers, so why does the law permit FHA to insure mortgages up to $822,375? This is a question for Congress and the taxpayers who stand behind FHA to answer,"" said Assistant Secretary for Housing and Federal Housing Commissioner Dana Wade.
In high-cost areas of the country, FHA's loan limit ceiling will increase to $822,375 from $765,600. FHA will also increase its floor to $356,362 from $331,760. Additionally, the FHA-insured Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) maximum claim amount (HECM limits) for reverse mortgages will increase to $822,375 from $765,600. FHA's current HECM regulations do not allow the HECM limit to vary by MSA or county; instead, the single HECM limit applies to all HECMs regardless of where the property is located.
In its November 13, 2020 Annual Report to Congress covering the financial status of FHA's Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund for fiscal year 2020, FHA provides recommendations for addressing the risks and flaws in current FHA loan limit calculations. Due to the statutory nature of these provisions, HUD cannot fully address the concerns without Congressional action.
Due to robust increases in median housing prices and required changes to FHA's floor and ceiling limits, which are tied to the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA)'s increase in the conventional mortgage loan limit for 2021, the maximum loan limits for FHA forward mortgages will rise in 3,108 counties. In 125 counties, FHA's loan limits will remain unchanged. By statute, the median home price for a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) is based on the county within the MSA having the highest median price. It has been HUD's long-standing practice to utilize the highest median price point for any year since the enactment of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act (HERA).
The National Housing Act, as amended by HERA, requires FHA to establish its floor and ceiling loan limits based on the loan limit set by FHFA for conventional mortgages owned or guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The national conforming loan limit for 2021 is $548,250. FHA's 2021 minimum national loan limit ""floor"" of $356,362 is set at 65 percent of the national conforming loan limit. This ""floor"" applies to those areas where 115 percent of the median home price is less than the ""floor"" limit.
Any area where the loan limit exceeds this ""floor"" is considered a high-cost area, and HERA requires FHA to set its maximum loan limit ""ceiling"" for high-cost areas at $356,362, which is 150 percent of the national conforming loan limit.

This report illustrates the number of material weaknesses, significant deficiencies, and non-compliances across the Department, including Ginnie Mae and FHA since the previous administration.
Prior to HUD CFO Irv Dennis' arrival, the Department had been without a dedicated CFO for several years causing severe mismanagement in a vital government agency. After being approved by the Senate in 2017, HUD CFO Irv Dennis led this financial transformation effort after years of neglect by the previous administration. Under Secretary Carson's leadership, he has successfully revamped HUD's audit process, reduced the number of material weaknesses in the financial systems at HUD from 9 in 2018 to 1; and ensured compliance with federal laws and regulations where HUD had previously been non-compliant.
""Millions of people across the nation rely on HUD to keep a roof over their head so when the Department's financial controls are left without proper oversight, it really can have a tremendously negative impact on our country's most vulnerable citizens. So for me, this job is personal, not political,"" said HUD CFO Irv Dennis.
The audit resolution continues the trajectory of fiscal responsibility that was set in place under the leadership of Secretary Carson.
""When an institution becomes insulated from the success or failure of its policies, it loses its incentive to operate efficiently. Private businesses, while engaged in different work than the federal government, do not have the luxury of being protected from their failures or maintaining damaging courses of action,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""Irv Dennis was able to accomplish the impossible task of providing the financial stability that had gone left unchecked for so many years.""

The supportive housing assistance is provided through the HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) Program, which combines rental assistance from HUD with case management and clinical services provided by the VA. See the local impact.
A component of the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program, the HUD-VASH vouchers being awarded today enable homeless veterans to obtain affordable, decent housing in the private market. These vouchers are critical tools in helping communities effectively end homelessness among veterans.
""Ending veteran homelessness has been a top priority for the Trump Administration since day one,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""We have an obligation to ensure that our nation's veterans, who have given so much for our country are not left out on the streets. They fought for us, now it's time for us to fight for them.""
In the HUD-VASH program, VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) assess veterans experiencing homelessness before referring them to local housing agencies for these vouchers. Decisions are based on a variety of factors, most importantly the duration of homelessness and the need for longer term, more intensive support in obtaining and maintaining permanent housing. The HUD-VASH program includes both the rental assistance the voucher provides and the comprehensive case management that VAMC staff offers.
Veterans participating in the HUD-VASH program rent privately owned housing and generally contribute no more than 30 percent of their income toward rent. VA offers eligible homeless veterans clinical and supportive services through its medical centers across the U.S., Guam, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands."

WASHINGTON - U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson today hosted the fourth ""Mustard Seed Series"" meeting during which he highlighted the work of FirstPres Church of Hayward, California. The virtual series is focused on faith organizations that have successfully created affordable housing, reduced homelessness, or used innovative housing models to serve individuals in need. The meetings serve as a forum for other faith organizations to learn about the experiences of these communities and to replicate the successes they have experienced.
Today's event featured FirstPres Church of Hayward's Tiny Homes in Castro Valley, California and the nonprofit organization the church formed, Firm Foundation Community Housing. To combat homelessness in their community, the FirstPres Tiny Homes project has built six mobile housing units in the FirstPres parking lot to house local homeless individuals temporarily as they transition to permanent housing. As the cost of housing continues to rise, the project's goal is to end involuntary homelessness in Alameda County. To assist others in replicating the project, FirstPres formed Firm Foundation Community Housing, a group that provides project managers to guide the faith community, stakeholders, and landowners through the process of permitting, designing, building, and installing Tiny Home villages on underutilized property.
""FirstPres Church of Hayward has not only impacted their community by lifting their homeless neighbors up off the streets and into dignified homes, but they also continue to be a force of change by helping to jump start similar projects in other communities,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""This Administration believes the private sector and local communities can partner with the government in caring for our most vulnerable men, women, and children. America's churches stand on the very front line of that fight.""
""In our communities we have major issues to tackle,"" said Jake Medcalf, Lead Pastor of FirstPres Church of Hayward. ""We have brothers and sisters destined to life on the streets because we refuse to engage in creative and compassionate ways. Tiny home villages are just one solution, but to me they are proof that when we work together as a community - government, faith community, business industry - and say, 'Not in my neighborhood will we let people live on the streets,' we can figure it out. That is my faith tradition living itself out. I believe that together we can solve the housing crisis we face across America.""

Under the agreement, the city will repeal the ordinances that established the programs and create a remediation fund of $200,000 to improve housing conditions for low- or moderate-income households, including by proactively addressing potential code violations. Read the agreement.
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 holds that no person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.
""Programs that purport to make housing 'crime free' or free of 'nuisances' may not be used as tools for enacting discriminatory housing policies and practices,"" said Anna María Farías, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""A person's race or nationality should not dictate where they may live, and we're pleased that this agreement commits the city to ending its unlawful programs.""
Michael B. Williams, HUD Principal Deputy General Counsel said, ""HUD is committed to enforcing fair housing and civil rights laws, including Title VI, and will continue to ensure that its grantees comply with their obligation not to discriminate on the basis of any protected class. HUD will continue to protect the right to be free from housing discrimination.""
Since 2013, the City of Hemet spent approximately one million dollars in Community Development Block Grant funds on the enforcement of programs which imposed penalties on property owners if five or more calls per year were made to law enforcement or to code enforcement for nuisance activity at a property. The terms of the programs lacked an exception for calls from victims of domestic violence or other crimes and did not have safeguards for individuals with disabilities. The programs also required landlords to enforce a crime-free lease addendum mandating immediate eviction for a single act of broadly defined criminal activity. Landlords also were subject to annual inspections, fees, and a registration process that required the property to be kept ""free from crime, nuisances and other unwanted behavior.""

12/14/2020:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2020/pr20-209.cfm,HUD Secretary Ben Carson Applauds Whole of Government Approach to Protecting Religious Liberty,"WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) joined the Agency for International Development and the Departments of Justice, Labor, Homeland Security, Education, Health and Human Services, Veterans Affairs, and Agriculture to issue the joint final rule regarding the implementation of Executive Order 12831. This joint rule will ensure religious and non-religious organizations are treated equally by the federal government and clarifies that religious organizations do not lose legal protections and rights due to participation in federal activities and programs.
""For many Americans, houses of worship serve a wide variety of purposes in communities, which oftentimes expand far beyond the practice of one's Faith,"" said Secretary Ben Carson. ""That is why, especially during this global pandemic, there must be a unified effort not to encroach upon religious liberty, but to ensure that places of worship are best able to respond and serve the needs of communities across our nation. It is powerful to see many federal agencies advocate for equal treatment and against any discriminatory practices, consistent with law.""
The final rule ensures equal treatment by removing regulations that were first imposed in 2016 by the Obama Administration, which burdened religious organizations, but not secular organizations. It also prohibits imposing future requirements that impose similar burdens solely on religious organizations.
The rule changes will pertain to faith-based organizations that apply for, or participate in, social service programs supported with federal financial assistance. This includes grants, vouchers, certain contracts, and other awards of funds. There are many religious organizations providing aid and assistance to under-served communities throughout the country."

""In one year, we've eliminated over 1.5 million pieces of paper flooding FHA by implementing the FHA Catalyst: Claims Module,"" said Deputy Assistant Secretary for Finance and Budget Susan Betts. ""Through their work on FHA Catalyst, FHA's Finance and Budget Claims Processing Team addressed the document processing challenges that stemmed from a lack of technology.""
""With FHA Catalyst, we're able to rapidly deliver high value functionality at lightning quick speed. We are mapping the success of the claims module across the loan lifecycle and across FHA,"" said the Chief Digital Services Officer Arthur Chin.
In addition to forward mortgage claim submissions, today lenders and servicers participating in FHA's Single Family insurance programs can use FHA Catalyst modules for the electronic submission of case binders and appraisals, and for access to FHA's new automated underwriting system.

Read local summaries of the grants announced today.
HUD's Choice Neighborhoods program promotes a comprehensive approach to transforming neighborhoods struggling to address the interconnected challenges of distressed housing, inadequate schools, poor health, high crime, and historic disinvestment.
Choice Neighborhoods is focused on three core goals:
• Housing: Replace distressed public and assisted housing with high-quality mixed-income housing that is well-managed and responsive to the needs of the surrounding neighborhood.
• People: Improve outcomes of households living in the target housing related to employment and income, health, and children's education.
• Neighborhood: Create the conditions necessary for public and private reinvestment in distressed neighborhoods to offer the kinds of amenities and assets, including safety, good schools, and commercial activity, that are important to families' choices about their community.
Through Choice Neighborhoods Planning Grants, local governments, housing authorities, residents, nonprofits, tribal authorities, private developers, school districts, police departments, and other civic organizations create a common vision and develop effective strategies to revitalize their neighborhood. The resulting Transformation Plan lays the foundation for revitalizing the distressed public and/or assisted housing units, transforming the surrounding neighborhood, and promoting opportunities for families."
12/18/2020:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2020/pr20-212.cfm,HUD Awards $78 Million to Help Families Reach Self-Sufficiency,"WASHINGTON - Today, U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson awarded approximately $78 million to hundreds of public housing authorities across the country to help residents of public housing and voucher-assisted housing increase their earned income and reduce their dependency on public assistance and rental subsidies. Under Secretary Carson's leadership, more money has been allocated to the Family Self -Sufficiency (FSS) Program in FY20 (fiscal year 2020) than at any other point in the program's history. Read more about the local impact of the grants announced today.
""Putting people on the path to self-sufficiency by helping them find jobs and increase their earned income is an essential part of HUD's mission,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""This funding is a good example of how federal and local partnerships work to help connect families to jobs and educational opportunities to help them become a success.""
HUD's Family Self -Sufficiency (FSS) Program funding helps local public housing authorities to hire Service Coordinators who work directly with residents to connect them with existing programs and services in the local community. These Service Coordinators build relationships with networks of local service providers, who provide direct assistance to FSS participants. The broad spectrum of services made possible through FSS enables participating families to find jobs, increase earned income, reduce or eliminate the need for rental and/or welfare assistance, and make progress toward achieving economic independence and self-sufficiency.
Participants in the program sign a five-year contract of participation requiring the head of the household to set specific goals and achievements allowed under the FSS Program. To successfully graduate, the head of household must be employed and no member of the FSS family may have received cash welfare assistance for twelve months prior to program graduation. Families in the FSS program have an interest-bearing escrow account established for them. The amount credited to the family's escrow account is based on increases rent due to improvement in the family's earned income during the term of the FSS contract. Upon successful graduation, the head of household receives the escrow funds are able to apply those funds to advance their personal circumstances, including, for example, paying educational expenses or making a down-payment on a home.
Many of the FY20 FSS awards are to public housing authorities with units in Opportunity Zones. Created under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Opportunity Zones aim to stimulate long-term investments in low-income communities.
HUD did not receive applications for FSS renewal funding from every eligible PHA with an existing FSS Program. With approximately $2 million in remaining FY 2020 funding, HUD plans to issue a supplemental Notice of Funding Opportunity inviting those eligible PHAs with FSS Programs to apply competitively for the residual FY 2020 funds."

The FHA is also extending through February 28, 2021, the deadline for single family borrowers with FHA-insured mortgages to request an initial COVID-19 forbearance from their mortgage servicer to defer or reduce their mortgage payments for up to six months, which can be extended for an additional six months. In addition, today FHA also extended multiple temporary provisions for lenders and servicers to allow them to continue doing FHA business despite social distancing considerations.
This is the fourth extension of FHA's eviction and foreclosure moratorium. The moratorium prohibits servicers from initiating or proceeding with foreclosure and foreclosure-related eviction actions for FHA-insured single family forward and reverse mortgages, except for those secured by legally vacant and abandoned properties. Further, FHA requires mortgage servicers to provide up to six months of COVID-19 forbearance when a borrower requests this assistance, and up to an additional six months of COVID-19 forbearance for borrowers who request an extension of the initial forbearance. Borrowers needing assistance must engage with their servicer to obtain an initial COVID-19 forbearance on or before February 28, 2021.
""Throughout this global pandemic, the Trump Administration has taken unprecedented steps to assist FHA-insured borrowers who are impacted by COVID-19,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""Today's foreclosure moratorium and forbearance extensions for single family homeowners ensure American homeowners continue to have the critical relief and support they need to get back to financial stability.""
""COVID-19 has created hardships for millions of Americans. FHA will continue to assist borrowers who are struggling to regain their financial footing as a result of this pandemic. American homeowners should not be forced from their homes while they are seeking help,"" said Assistant Secretary for Housing and Federal Housing Commissioner Dana Wade.
To assist lenders and servicers in continuing to supply FHA-insured affordable mortgage financing despite the considerations for social distancing, today FHA also extended:
The timeframe for providing an insurance endorsement on single family mortgages in forbearance through March 31, 2021. Temporary re-verification of employment guidance and exterior-only appraisal inspection option through February 28, 2021.

12/22/2020:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2020/pr20-216.cfm,Federal Housing Administration Announces Updated Single Family Loan-Level Certification Form,"WASHINGTON - The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) today announced the completion of its revised and streamlined loan-level certification form required from lenders when originating a single family mortgage intended for FHA insurance endorsement. The updated form eliminates unnecessarily dense language while remaining consistent with pertinent statutes and other program requirements. The updated form also continues to safeguard FHA against fraud and misrepresentation by requiring lenders and borrowers to certify to the truthfulness and accuracy of required information.
""As outlined in HUD's Housing Finance Reform plan, we have taken great steps to provide clarity and certainty needed for qualified lenders to continue participating in FHA's Single Family insurance program and providing borrowers affordable homeownership opportunities,"" said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. ""Today's announcement capstones the work done by HUD, including our Memorandum of Understanding with the Department of Justice on the use of the False Claims Act, and the revisions to our Single Family defect taxonomy and the annual lender certification.""
""We believe the revised loan-level certification strikes the right balance between clarity and accuracy and our ability to take strong enforcement actions against those who willingly harm FHA and the American taxpayer. This certification can and should survive the test of time,"" said Assistant Secretary for Housing and Federal Housing Commissioner Dana Wade.
The revised form, officially called the HUD Form 92900-A, Addendum to Uniform Residential Loan Application is mandated by FHA and must have signatures from the underwriter and/or other lender representative, as well as the borrower. The revised HUD Form 92900-A may be used by lenders immediately but is required for all FHA single family forward and Home Equity Conversion Mortgages submitted for FHA insurance endorsements with case numbers assigned on and after March 22, 2021.
""The new loan-level certification form is the result of extensive work performed by FHA over the last year to assess the public and industry comments received on proposed drafts. The new certification is cleaner and clearer, which should go a long way toward alleviating the concerns with the previous form expressed by lenders over the years,"" said Deputy Assistant Secretary for Single Family Housing Joe Gormley.
The revised loan-level certification is the final piece of FHA's promised reforms to reduce concerns about significant actions that could be taken against lenders for minor errors in underwriting. In October 2019, FHA announced a Memorandum of Understanding with the U.S. Department of Justice that provided new ground rules for the appropriate application of the False Claims Act, versus other remedies that FHA can pursue to address underwriting defects with individual lenders. FHA also revised its annual certification statements that lenders must submit each year to FHA, which covers certifications related to their organization and business operations. Last fall, FHA launched a revised version of its Single Family Loan Quality Assessment Methodology, known as the ""defect taxonomy,"" which provides lenders with a detailed assessment of how FHA views the severity of various underwriting errors in the mortgages it insures, and the appropriate remedies that lenders must take to address these errors."
