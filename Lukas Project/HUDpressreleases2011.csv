01/04/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-001.cfm,FHA Issues Guidance for Reverse Mortgage Borrowers and Lenders Dealing with Outstanding Property Tax and Insurance Debts,"WASHINGTON - The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) today released guidance to homeowners and lenders that use the reverse mortgage or Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) program and are dealing with outstanding property taxes and unpaid hazard insurance premiums. FHA's guidance is intended to assist elderly borrowers who have neglected to pay these expenses and may face foreclosure.
""We understand that some senior citizens have not paid their taxes or insurance for some time and may be at risk of losing their home,"" said FHA Commissioner David H. Stevens. ""Today's guidance is designed to establish a clear framework that protects both the homeowner and the lender who participate in our reverse mortgage program.""
HUD regulations allow lenders to make tax and insurance payments on behalf of their elderly clients from the borrower's available mortgage funds. However, once those resources are exhausted, the lender must advance funds to protect FHA's interest and obtain reimbursement from the borrower.
Over time, however, these unpaid debts and lender advances have resulted in an untenable situation that could put the FHA Insurance Fund at risk and result in foreclosure proceedings against delinquent seniors. While the guidance issued today is intended to help elderly homeowners avoid foreclosure, lenders may have no choice if these defaults are not cured.
FHA's Mortgagee Letter applies to all HECM loans where the lender/servicer advanced corporate funds to satisfy an unpaid property charge on behalf of the borrower. It reminds lenders that foreclosure is to be a last resort when dealing with their elderly clients. It also includes sample letters that lenders may use to make certain borrowers understand that property tax and hazard insurance are required expenses that must be paid even though the homeowner owes nothing on their mortgage loan.
When a borrower fails to pay a property charge, the loan is deemed to be out of compliance with the provisions of the mortgage and FHA considers the loan to be delinquent. Lenders/servicers, however, must work with the borrower to try to bring the loan current at the earliest possible point. It is only after all loss mitigation strategies have been exhausted that the lender may submit a ""due and payable"" request to FHA.
Today's Mortgagee Letter precisely defines the process and reporting requirements lender/servicers must follow to collect unpaid property charges from HECM borrowers. FHA is strongly encouraging HECM borrowers who have outstanding property charges to work closely with loan servicers and approved housing counselors who can provide free assistance to help them resolve the situation and avoid any foreclosure action.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is providing nearly $3 million to housing counseling agencies to specifically help reverse mortgage borrowers facing this issue. Counselors will help elderly homeowners work with their servicer to create repayment plans that cure the outstanding balance. If keeping the home is no longer an option, the counselors will help the borrower transition to alternative housing.
Under this new guidance, lenders must send letters to borrowers who recently missed a property charge payment, borrowers who had an unpaid property charge balance for an extended period, and to borrowers with a significant unpaid property charge balance. Lenders have until April 29, 2011, to send all letters to borrowers with loans that are delinquent as of the date of the Mortgagee Letter. Thereafter, letters must be sent as soon as the mortgagee receives notice of a missed payment
The lender must also offer loss mitigation options to allow the borrower the opportunity to cure the deficiency. These options must include, but are not limited to, establishing a realistic repayment plan; contacting a HUD-approved housing counseling agency to provide free assistance to the borrower; and refinancing the delinquent HECM to a new reverse mortgage if there is sufficient equity to pay off the existing mortgage and bring the property charges current.
To avoid problems with unpaid property charges in the future, FHA recently enhanced the HECM program's pre-closing counseling requirements. Counselors must now place a greater focus on educating borrowers on how important it is that they fulfill the terms of the mortgage, including the requirement that borrowers make timely tax and insurance payments. In addition, counselors now employ a new financial tool which helps identify potential budget shortfalls. Finally, HUD will shortly publish a proposed rule that adds more preventative measures and consumer protections to the existing HECM regulations."

A recent HUD review disclosed that Marin County had failed to meet its Fair Housing obligations in its use and expenditure of HUD Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and HOME funds.
""This agreement increases Marin's accountability to its residents and to HUD to carry out its Fair Housing obligations and document that its programs serve everyone, regardless of race, ethnicity, or disability,"" said HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity John Trasviña.
Under the terms of the Voluntary Compliance Agreement (VCA) announced today, Marin County officials will:
Work together with agencies and private developers to ensure that affordable housing development opportunities will be affirmatively marketed to low income minority and disabled persons; Conduct a study to identify and overcome Fair Housing barriers, such as community resistance to fair housing choice in neighborhoods and the continued development of low income affordable housing in neighborhoods with high minority concentrations; Create an outreach plan so that the views of low income residents, particularly disabled persons, racial and ethnic minorities and families are included in public meetings where the County will discuss and solicit input on which low income neighborhoods and public activities they will select to spend their HUD funds and meet their responsibility to affirmatively further fair housing; Hold all meetings associated with the administration of HUD funds in facilities that are fully accessible to persons with disabilities; and Develop a Language Assistance Plan which will require the development of documents and announcements in non-English languages for those persons with limited English speaking proficiency, so they can learn about and participate in HUD-funded low income affordable housing programs and public service activities.

01/06/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-003.cfm,"HUD, HHS Announce Joint Effort to Assist Nearly 1,000 Non-Elderly Persons with Disabilities to Move from Institutions to Independence","WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Shaun Donovan and Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Kathleen Sebelius announced today a joint partnership between the two agencies to help nearly 1,000 non-elderly Americans with disabilities leave nursing homes or other healthcare facilities to live independently. This is the first time two federal agencies are offering a combination of rental assistance, health care and other supportive services targeted to this population.
HUD is providing $7.5 million in rental assistance vouchers that will help nearly 1,000 individuals with disabilities rent private apartments. Public housing authorities in 15 states will administer the rental subsidies and will work with state human service agencies to identify eligible individuals who could benefit from the program. For a local breakdown of the funding announced today, visit HUD's Web site.
Individuals receiving rental assistance through the program will also receive health and social supports that will enable them to live independently. These supports are provided through the HHS Centers for Medicare and Medicaid's ""Money Follows the Person"" (MFP) grant program, which allows individuals who qualify for Medicaid-funded nursing home or other institutional care to receive supports - such as in-home nursing and personal care services - while living in the community instead. In places where the MFP program is not available, services will be provided by a state-sponsored institutional transitional program comparable to MFP that includes dedicated supportive services.
As part of President Obama's Year of Community Living initiative, HUD and HHS launched a joint effort to provide housing support for non-elderly persons with disabilities who are currently receiving long-term care in institutional settings. The interagency collaboration is intended to allow persons with disabilities to live productive independent lives in their communities rather than in institutions.
""The Obama administration is committed to helping Americans with disabilities live independent lives. Housing is a critical piece of the equation when it comes to transitioning out of institutions,"" said Donovan. ""Coordinating this effort with the Department of Health and Human Services is an important step in ensuring that more Americans with disabilities will have the housing and support they need to fully participate in community life.""
""Through our collaboration with the Department of Housing and Urban Development, I know that we will be able to dramatically change peoples' lives,"" said Sebelius. ""Individuals with disabilities can have a life in the community that serves their needs and supports them in leading productive, meaningful lives.""
The funding announced today is being provided through HUD's Rental Assistance for Non-Elderly Persons with Disabilities Program. It is part of the $40 million HUD made available April 2010 to public housing authorities across the U.S. to fund approximately 5,300 rental assistance vouchers for non-elderly persons with disabilities to promote independent living for this community. Public housing authorities applied for funding under two categories.
Last October, HUD awarded $33 million to support a first round of 4,300 vouchers, making it possible for non-elderly individuals with disabilities and their families to access affordable housing in communities that meet their housing needs and so avoid potential institutionalization. Today's announcement is for the second round funding to provide 948 vouchers targeted for non-elderly individuals with disabilities currently living in institutional settings, such as nursing homes, but who could move into a community with assistance.
These vouchers will augment work already being done by HHS's Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) through its Money Follows the Person (MFP) rebalancing demonstration program. Now in its fourth year, the MFP program has made it possible for almost 12,000 individuals to live more independent lives by providing necessary supports and services in the community. Twenty-nine states and the District of Columbia are currently participating in the MFP program and CMS is expecting a new round of grant applications on January 7th.
State Medicaid agencies and local human service organizations will link eligible families to local public housing authorities that will administer voucher distribution. To improve the connections between the housing authorities and Medicaid agencies, HUD and HHS have launched the Housing Capacity Building Initiative for Community Living Project to assist seniors and individuals with chronic conditions who are at risk of institutionalization or who currently receive care in institutional settings, in finding appropriate housing in order to live more independent lives.
The Community Living Initiative is an outgrowth of the 1999 landmark Supreme Court ruling in Olmstead v. L.C. In that case, the Court ruled that the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) protects a person with a disability from being unnecessarily institutionalized. The Court said that such forced institutionalization can lead to isolation and segregation of individuals with disabilities and be a serious and pervasive form of discrimination."
01/13/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-004.cfm,HUD Awards $127 Million in Grants to Protect Thousands of Children from Lead and Other Home Hazards,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Dept. of Housing and Urban Development today awarded nearly $127 million in grants to 48 local projects to conduct a wide range of activities intended to protect children and families from potentially dangerous lead-based paint and other home health and safety hazards (see chart below).
The grant funding announced today will clean up lead and other health hazards in more than 11,000 homes, train workers in lead safety methods, and increase public awareness about childhood lead poisoning. Lead is a known toxin that can impair children's development and have effects lasting into adulthood. Other materials in the home can trigger allergic responses and asthma.
""Protecting the health, and indeed the futures, of our children is a top priority for HUD. We cannot allow children to be poisoned in their own homes,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""These grants will help communities around the nation to protect families from lead exposure and other significant health and safety hazards.""
HUD Deputy Secretary Ron Sims added: ""With these grant awards, HUD makes it clear that providing healthy and safe homes for families and children is a priority. It's simple: you can't be healthy if your home is sick. There are far too many 'sick homes' in our communities, and these funds will target the worst of those homes. HUD is committed to protecting children from these hazards, as part of the Department's effort to help make the nation's housing healthy and sustainable.""
The following is a breakdown of the funding announced today:
Through these grant programs, HUD's Office of Healthy Homes and Lead Hazard Control promotes local efforts to eliminate dangerous lead hazards from lower income homes; stimulates private sector investment in lead hazard control; and educates the public about the dangers of lead-based paint. A complete project-by-project summary of the programs awarded grants today can be found on HUD's website.
Healthy Homes and Lead Hazard Control Grant Programs
Even though lead-based paint was banned for residential use in 1978, HUD estimates that approximately 24 million homes still have significant lead-based paint hazards today. Lead-contaminated dust is the primary cause of lead exposure and can lead to a variety of health problems in young children, including reduced IQ, learning disabilities, developmental delays, reduced height, and impaired hearing. At higher levels, lead can damage a child's kidneys and central nervous system and cause anemia, coma, convulsions and even death.
The funding announced today includes more than $114 million to cities, counties and states to eliminate dangerous lead paint hazards in thousands of privately-owned, low-income housing units. These funds are provided through HUD's Lead-Based Paint Hazard Control and Lead Hazard Reduction Demonstration grant programs. To expand the reach of HUD's Lead Hazard Control Program, more than $13 million of this funding will support new grantees. HUD is also providing nearly $2.3 million to help communities transform their lead hazard control programs to address multiple housing-related hazards. Finally, HUD will award $10 million in Healthy Homes Production grant funds to address housing-related health hazards, such as accidental injury, mold and moisture, and carbon monoxide poisoning, through direct improvements that affect the health of children and elderly adults.
The following is a state-by-state breakdown of the funding announced today:
*Grant program abbreviations are as follows:

The grants announced today form a critical foundation for the Obama Administration's Opening Doors strategy, the nation's first comprehensive plan to prevent and end homelessness. View a local summary of the grants announced today on HUD's website.
Today's announcement also comes just a week before thousands of volunteers in nearly every city and county conduct a national one-night count of homeless persons and families. HUD's Let's Make Everybody Count! campaign is intended to document trends in homelessness that are crucial to local planners' efforts to prevent and end homelessness in their areas.
""There is a tremendous need on our streets and in our shelters among those experiencing both long-term homelessness as well as families confronting a sudden economic crisis,"" said Donovan. ""These grants are the life blood for thousands of local housing and service programs that are doing the heavy lifting to meet President Obama's goal of ending homelessness.""
Barbara Poppe, Executive Director of the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness Executive Director, added, ""Across federal agencies, we are aligning mainstream programs towards a goal to prevent and end homelessness. While we continue to strengthen public-private partnerships in Washington and across the country to meet this goal, today's grants provide essential support to continue the progress and meet critical needs of those who experience the crisis of homelessness.""
In June, 19 federal agencies and offices that form the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH) submitted to the President and Congress the nation's first comprehensive strategy to prevent and end homelessness. The full report is titled Opening Doors: Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness (www.usich.gov/OpeningDoors.html). The plan puts the country on a path to end veterans and chronic homelessness by 2015; and to ending homelessness among children, family, and youth by 2020.
Last September, HUD announced that it would renew funding through HUD's Continuum of Care programs to existing local programs as quickly as possible to prevent any interruption in federal assistance. HUD will award funds to new projects later in the year.
HUD's Continuum of Care grants provide permanent and transitional housing to homeless persons as well as services including job training, health care, mental health counseling, substance abuse treatment and child care. Continuum of Care grants are awarded competitively to local programs to meet the needs of their homeless clients. These grants fund a wide variety of programs from street outreach and assessment programs to transitional and permanent housing for homeless persons and families.
HUD's homeless assistance grants are reducing long-term or chronic homelessness in America. Based on the Department's latest homeless assessment, chronic homelessness has declined since 2005 due to significant investments to produce thousands of units of permanent supportive housing for those who had been living on the streets. While the total number of homeless persons in America dropped slightly between 2008 and 2009, the number of homeless families increased for the second consecutive year, almost certainly due to the ongoing effects of the recession. In the last 10 days of January, volunteers from across the country will attempt to count the number of homeless persons living in shelters and on the streets as part of a national point-in-time count. For more information about HUD's ""Let's Make Everybody Count!"" campaign, visit www.hud.gov/homelesscount.
Based on HUD's 2009 Annual Homeless Assessment Report (AHAR), volunteers throughout the nation counted 643,000 homeless people during a given night in January 2009. In addition, HUD found that during 2009, 1.54 million people used emergency or transitional housing programs in 2009. A typical sheltered homeless person is a single, middle-aged man and a member of a minority group. Of all those who sought emergency shelter or transitional housing during 2009, the following characteristics were observed:
78 percent of all sheltered homeless persons are adults; 61 percent are male; 62 percent are members of a minority group; 38 percent are 31-to-50 years old; 64 percent are in one-person households, and 38 percent have a disability.

• 62 percent are members of a minority group;
• 38 percent are 31-to-50 years old;
• 64 percent are in one-person households, and
• 38 percent have a disability.
In addition to HUD's annual grant awards, HUD allocated $1.5 billion through its new Homeless Prevention and Rapid Re-housing (HPRP) Program. Made possible through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, HPRP is intended to prevent persons from falling into homelessness or to rapidly re-house them if they do. To date, more than 750,000 persons have been assisted through HPRP."
01/20/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-006.cfm,HUD Proposes New Rule to Ensure Equal Access to Housing Regardless of Sexual Orientation or Gender Identity,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today proposed new regulations intended to ensure that its core housing programs are open to all eligible persons, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. View the proposed rule announced today.
""This is a fundamental issue of fairness,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""We have a responsibility to make certain that public programs are open to all Americans. With this proposed rule, we will make clear that a person's eligibility for federal housing programs is, and should be, based on their need and not on their sexual orientation or gender identity.""
HUD is seeking public comment on a number of proposed areas including:
Prohibiting lenders from using sexual orientation or gender identity as a basis to determine a borrower's eligibility for FHA-insured mortgage financing. FHA's current regulations provide that a mortgage lender's determination of the adequacy of a borrower's income ""shall be made in a uniform manner without regard to"" specified prohibited grounds. The proposed rule would add actual or perceived sexual orientation and gender identity to the prohibited grounds to ensure FHA-approved lenders do not deny or otherwise alter the terms of mortgages on the basis of irrelevant criteria. Clarifying that all otherwise eligible families, regardless of marital status, sexual orientation, or gender identity, have the opportunity to participate in HUD programs. In the majority of HUD's rental and homeownership programs the term ""family"" already has a broad scope, and includes a single person and families with or without children. HUD's proposed rule clarifies that families, otherwise eligible for HUD programs, may not be excluded because one or more members of the family may be an LGBT individual, have an LGBT relationship, or be perceived to be such an individual or in such relationship. Prohibiting owners and operators of HUD-assisted housing, or housing whose financing is insured by HUD, from inquiring about the sexual orientation or gender identity of an applicant for, or occupant of, the dwelling, whether renter- or owner-occupied. HUD is proposing to institute this policy in its rental assistance and homeownership programs, which include the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) mortgage insurance programs, community development programs, and public and assisted housing programs.

Other actions:
HUD is conducting the first-ever national study of discrimination against members of the LGBT community in the rental and sale of housing. Every ten years, HUD does a study of the impact of housing discrimination on the basis of race and color. HUD undertook this important research in 1977, 1989 and 2000 and is currently undertaking this study again. It is believed that LGBT individuals and families may remain silent because in many local jurisdictions, they may have little or no legal recourse. While there are no national assessments of LGBT housing discrimination, there are state and local studies that have shown evidence of this sort of bias. For example, a 2007 report by Michigan's Fair Housing Centers (www.fhcmichigan.org/images/Arcus_web1.pdf) found that nearly 30 percent of same-sex couples were treated differently when attempting to buy or rent a home.
HUD currently requires its recipients of discretionary funds to comply with local and state non-discrimination laws that cover sexual orientation or gender identity. In July, the Department issued new guidance that treats discrimination based on gender nonconformity or sex stereotyping as sex discrimination under the Fair Housing Act, and instructs HUD staff to inform individuals filing complaints about state and local agencies that have LGBT-inclusive nondiscrimination laws.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in rental, sales and lending on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, disability and familial status. Approximately 20 states, and the District of Columbia, and more than 150 cities, towns and counties across the nation have additional protections that specifically prohibit such discrimination against LGBT individuals. Under guidance announced last year, HUD will, as appropriate, retain its jurisdiction over complaints filed by LGBT individuals or families but also jointly investigate or refer matters to those state, district and local governments with other legal protections.

01/28/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-007.cfm,FHA Extends 'Anti-Flipping Waiver' to Help Stabilize Housing Market,"WASHINGTON - In an effort to continue stabilizing home values and improve conditions in communities experiencing high foreclosure activity, Federal Housing Administration (FHA) Commissioner David H. Stevens today extended FHA's temporary waiver of the agency's 'anti-flipping rule.' The extension announced today is intended to accelerate the resale of foreclosed upon homes in neighborhoods struggling to overcome possible property abandonment and blight.
With certain exceptions, FHA regulations prohibit insuring a mortgage on a home owned by the seller for less than 90 days. Early last year, FHA temporarily waived this regulation through January 31, 2011. FHA today posted a notice extending this waiver through the remainder of 2011. This action will permit buyers to continue to use FHA-insured financing to purchase HUD-owned properties, bank-owned properties, or properties resold through private sales. It will allow homes to resell as quickly as possible, helping to stabilize real estate prices and to revitalize neighborhoods and communities.
""As I noted when we first announced this policy change early last year, because of the tightened credit market, FHA-insured mortgage financing is often the only means of financing available to potential homebuyers,"" said Stevens. ""Today I can report that this policy change has been effective. Since the original waiver went into effect on last February, FHA has insured more than 21,000 mortgages worth over $3.6 billion on properties resold within 90 days of acquisition.""
FHA research finds that in today's market, acquiring, rehabilitating and reselling these properties to prospective homeowners often takes less than 90 days. Prohibiting the use of FHA mortgage insurance for a subsequent resale within 90 days of acquisition adversely impacts the willingness of sellers to allow contracts from potential FHA buyers because they must consider holding costs and the risk of vandalism associated with allowing a property to sit vacant over a 90-day period of time.
Stevens added, ""Because of past restrictions, FHA borrowers have often been shut out from buying affordable properties. This action enables our borrowers, especially first-time buyers, to take advantage of this opportunity and buy a home that has recently been rehabilitated. It will also help to move more foreclosed properties off the market and reduce the number of vacant homes in neighborhoods throughout this country.""
The extension announced today is effective through December 31, 2011, unless otherwise extended or withdrawn by FHA. All other terms of the waiver will remain the same, and HUD continues to invite public comment on it. The waiver contains strict conditions and guidelines to assure that predatory practices are not allowed.
To protect FHA borrowers against predatory practices of ""flipping"" where properties are quickly resold at inflated prices to unsuspecting borrowers, this waiver continues to be limited to those sales meeting the following general conditions:
All transactions must be arms-length, with no identity of interest between the buyer and seller or other parties participating in the sales transaction. In cases in which the sales price of the property is 20 percent or more above the seller's acquisition cost, the waiver will only apply if the lender meets specific conditions. The waiver is limited to forward mortgages, and does not apply to the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) for purchase program.
• All transactions must be arms-length, with no identity of interest between the buyer and seller or other parties participating in the sales transaction.

01/28/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-008a.cfm,HUD Secretary Donovan Highlights Energy Efficient Innovation at Affordable Housing in Baltimore,"WASHINGTON - Today, U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Shaun Donovan visited Poppleton Phase II Apartments to highlight how the development is promoting energy efficient innovation and creating jobs in Baltimore, MD, supporting President Barack Obama's goal of helping America ""Win the Future.""
Secretary Donovan, U.S. Senator Benjamin L. Cardin, U.S. Representative Elijah Cummings and Mayor Stephanie Rawlings Blake toured and held a press conference at the 86-unit apartment complex that received $1.56 million from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009's Assisted Housing Green Retrofit Program. The Green Retrofit Program is providing funding for the installation of high-efficiency heat pumps for heating and cooling, new high-efficiency windows, a EnergyStar cool roof with added insulation, low-flow toilets, shower heads and faucets, and EnergyStar gas water heaters, refrigerators and bathroom exhaust fans for dozens of low and moderate income families. When the project is complete at the end of this year, 180 jobs will have been created for Baltimore-area residents directly from the project's funding. Additionally, many more clean-energy jobs will be created through the University of Maryland's BioPark, a new $300 million biotech campus that is situated near the Poppleton Phase II Apartments.
""The Poppleton Phase II Apartments is a reminder of the targeted investments that President Obama spoke about during his State of the Union speech this week,"" said Secretary Donovan. ""This development represents the type of innovation we need, by bringing clean energy investments to the homes of many low-and-moderate income Americans who will be able to save hundreds of dollars on their utility bills for many years to come I am delighted to have visited the development today to see an example of how communities across America are renewing their commitment to securing prosperity for ourselves and future generations of Americans.""
As part of the Recovery Act, the Green Retrofit Program provided $250 million nationally to reduce energy costs, cut water consumption, and improve indoor air quality. The program is designed to create thousands of green jobs across the country as workers retrofit older federally assisted multi-family apartment developments with the next generation of energy efficient and green building technologies. Grants and loans provided through this program help private landlords and property management companies to cut heating and air conditioning costs by installing more efficient heating and cooling systems and to reduce water use by replacing faucets and toilets. These Recovery Act funds also produce other environmental benefits by encouraging the use of recycled building materials, reflective roofing, and non-toxic products to reduce potentially harmful 'off-gassing' of harmful fumes. Funds were awarded to owners of HUD-assisted housing projects and can be used for a wide range of retrofit activities, ranging from windows/doors to solar panels and geothermal installation.
""This is a great example of using the green technology of the future to create green energy jobs today,"" U.S. Senator Barbara Mikulski said. ""These are jobs that can't be outsourced, and the work they're doing will help homeowners afford energy costs. It's a win-win.""
""The Poppleton project will provide low-income families with energy-saving housing that will help them reduce their energy costs,"" said U.S. Senator Benjamin L. Cardin. ""Paid for with Recovery funds, this project is a win-win, creating jobs while providing families with affordable, energy-saving housing.""
""This project is a wonderful example of what can happen when the private and public sectors work together to provide access to opportunity,"" Congressman Cummings said. ""The Poppleton community will serve as a national model for job creation and community revitalization. It's a win-win situation for all involved.""
The Recovery Act includes $13.61 billion for projects and programs administered by HUD, nearly 75 percent of which was allocated to state and local recipients only eight days after President Obama signed the Act into law. The remaining 25 percent was awarded through competitive grant programs, including the Green Retrofit Program. All of HUD's Recovery Act funds are in the hands of local communities, being used to improve housing and neighborhoods, while creating jobs. HUD is committed to implementing Recovery Act investments swiftly and effectively as they generate tens of thousands of jobs, modernize homes to make them energy efficient, and help the families and communities hardest hit by the economic crisis.
In addition, Secretary Donovan and the Department are committed to providing the highest level of transparency possible as Recovery Act funds are administered. It is vitally important that the American people are fully aware of how their tax dollars are being spent and can hold their federal leaders accountable. Every dollar of Recovery Act funds HUD spends can be reviewed and tracked at HUD's Recovery Act website. The full text of HUD's funding notices and tracking of future performance of these grants is also available at HUD's Recovery Act website."

A crucial component of Opening Doors - the federal plan to end homelessness - HUD's Let's Make Everybody Count! campaign is intended to document trends in homelessness and help local, state and federal partners make effective use of taxpayer resources.
""Each year, we ask volunteers in nearly 4,000 cities and counties across the nation to dedicate one day during the last week of January to count how many men, women and families are confronted with homelessness on a single night,"" said Donovan. ""Through these efforts, we will have the data needed to understand the scope and breadth of homelessness in America. And this year - for the first time - we can apply that data as part of a coordinated federal plan to end homelessness.""
Secretary Donovan, Deputy Secretary Gould and Director Poppe gave brief remarks to more than 80 volunteers at the New York Avenue Presbyterian Church in Washington, D.C., which served as the District of Columbia's ""Point in Time"" count volunteer staging location. After the remarks, Donovan, Gould and Poppe served as volunteers in downtown Washington, D.C.
""Secretary Shinseki and I are committed to ending homelessness amongst Veterans by 2015 and this week has been an important step toward achieving this goal,"" Veterans Affairs Deputy Secretary Gould said. ""VA is proud to be partnering with HUD and USICH in this important initiative and we look forward to utilizing this data nationwide to pursue opportunities to reach out to homeless Veterans.""
Data gathered from the ""Point in Time"" counts will be used to effectively allocate funding to HUD's programs and grantees, as well as measure the nation's progress on Opening Doors - the federal plan to end homelessness. In June, the Obama Administration announced the nation's first comprehensive strategy to prevent and end homelessness, titled Opening Doors: Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness (www.usich.gov/OpeningDoors.html). The plan puts the country on a path to end veterans and chronic homelessness by 2015; and to ending homelessness among children, family, and youth by 2020.
""We have had unprecedented collaboration across federal agencies for this year's Count to be the most comprehensive ever,"" said United States Interagency Council on Homelessness Executive Director Barbara Poppe. ""It is critically important that we have the most complete data possible for all populations in order to effectively target resources and programs.""
HUD is currently directing more than $2.9 billion in homeless funding towards those goals through the recently announced Continuum of Care grants which awarded $1.41 billion to nearly 7,000 local homeless assistance programs operating in the coming year, and $1.5 billion from the new Homeless Prevention and Rapid Re-housing (HPRP) Program made possible through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. HPRP grants have prevented or ended homelessness for more than three quarters of a million people.
HUD's homeless assistance grants are reducing long-term or chronic homelessness in America. Based on the Department's latest homeless assessment, chronic homelessness has dropped by nearly 30 percent since 2006 due to significant investments to produce thousands of units of permanent supportive housing for those who had been living on the streets. While the total number of homeless persons in America dropped slightly between 2008 and 2009, the number of homeless families increased for the second consecutive year, almost certainly due to the ongoing effects of the recession.
Based on HUD's 2009 Annual Homeless Assessment Report (AHAR), volunteers throughout the nation counted 643,000 homeless people during a given night in January 2009. In addition, HUD found that during 2009, 1.54 million people used emergency or transitional housing programs in 2009.
HUD's 2010 AHAR is expected to be released in summer 2011."
01/31/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-010.cfm,Obama Administration Releases January Housing Scorecard,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of the Treasury today released the January edition of the Obama Administration's Housing Scorecard. The latest housing figures show increased new and existing home sales as home affordability remains high, but officials caution that the market remains fragile, as prices are unsettled. Foreclosure starts and completions remained low at the year's end, as lenders continue to review internal servicing procedures. The Obama Administration's complete housing scorecard on the nation's housing market is available online at www.hud.gov/scorecard.
""Over the last 20 months, the Obama Administration has confronted the nation's housing crisis with an unprecedented effort to promote stability in the market – keeping millions of families in their homes and helping millions more to save money by refinancing. But the data clearly show that the market remains extremely fragile,"" said HUD Assistant Secretary Raphael Bostic. ""We know that many responsible homeowners are still fighting to make ends meet. That's why we're committed to continuing to provide help to homeowners by implementing the broad range of programs the Obama Administration has put in place.""
""Before the launch of the Administration's programs, little was done to offer meaningful assistance to homeowners struggling to deal with the worst housing crisis in generations. The data released today demonstrates that the Administration's programs are reaching middle income homeowners and providing them with real payment relief,"" said acting Treasury Assistant Secretary for Financial Stability Tim Massad. ""While we cannot prevent every foreclosure, it is important to remember that these programs have helped to create more options for affordable and sustainable assistance than have ever been available before.""
Each month, the Housing Scorecard incorporates key housing market indicators and highlights the impact of the Administration's housing recovery efforts, including assistance to homeowners through the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP). The January Housing Scorecard features key data on the health of the housing market including:
New and existing home sales increased in December, but remained below levels seen in the first half of 2010. Record low mortgage rates continue to keep home affordability at record high levels. However, home prices remain unsettled at this fragile stage of the recovery. As lenders review internal procedures related to foreclosure processing, many foreclosure actions have been delayed leading to a lower level of foreclosure activity in December than in prior months. The decline is likely to be temporary as lenders eventually revise and resubmit foreclosure paperwork in the coming months. More than 4.1 million modification arrangements were started between April 2009 and the end of December 2010 - more than double the number of foreclosure completions during that time. These actions included more than 1.4 million HAMP trial modification starts, more than 650,000 FHA loss mitigation and early delinquency interventions, and nearly 2 million proprietary modifications under HOPE Now. While some homeowners may have received help from more than one program, the number of agreements offered was more than double the number of foreclosure completions for the same period (1.7 million). View the December HAMP Servicer Performance Report. Homeowners in HAMP permanent modifications continue to perform well over time, with re-default rates lower than industry norms. December data for the Making Home Affordable Program (MHA) shows that after 12 months, nearly 85 percent of homeowners remain in a permanent modification. Homeowners in HAMP permanent modifications have already reduced their mortgage obligation by more than $4.5 billion to date.

In a continued commitment to enhanced reporting and transparency, today the Administration also released the Making Home Affordable Data File which includes characteristics of program participants to date, including financial information, mortgage loan information before and after entering HAMP, performance in a HAMP modification, and race/ethnicity data. The MHA Data File offers mortgage loan-level data and is intended to allow for better understanding of the impact of the program.
Key findings that emerged from a preliminary analysis of the MHA Data File include:
To date, most program participants are moderate and middle income, financially-distressed homeowners who are ""underwater"" on their mortgages. Borrowers in active permanent HAMP modifications have a median annual income of approximately $46,000; a median credit score of 570 upon entering the trial period; a post-modification loan balance of just over $232,000 and a median mark-to-market loan-to-value (LTV) of 118 percent. Of borrowers reporting race and ethnicity, African-Americans account for 18 percent of active permanent modifications and Hispanics account for 26 percent. Homeowners in active permanent modifications have seen their monthly mortgage payment cut by a median of approximately 40 percent. Eighteen percent of homeowners in active permanent modifications have reduced their monthly mortgage payment by more than $1,000 each month.

In preparing the MHA Data File, Treasury applied the recommendations of an independent non-profit, non-partisan policy institute to ensure the privacy of participating homeowners. The release of today's data file fulfills a requirement within the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act to make available loan-level data about the program. Treasury will update the file monthly and will expand reporting to include newer initiatives that are part of Making Home Affordable.

02/01/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-011.cfm,"HUD Reports 20 Percent Jump in ""Worst Case Needs"" from 2007 to 2009","WASHINGTON - In a report to Congress released today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) found that ""worst case housing needs"" grew by nearly 1.2 million households, or more than 20 percent, from 2007 to 2009 and by 42 percent since 2001. ""Worst case housing needs"" are defined as low-income households who paid more than half their monthly income for rent, lived in severely substandard housing, or both.
HUD's study, Worst Case Housing Needs 2009: A Report to Congress (www.huduser.org/portal/publications/affhsg/wc_HsgNeeds09.html), one in a long-term series of reports designed to measure the scale of critical housing problems facing low-income un-assisted American renting households. The findings are based on data from HUD's American Housing Survey conducted between May and September of 2009, predating the impact of the Obama Administration's economic recovery efforts, including the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). This report finds a direct link between the increased numbers of worst case needs and the recent recession and related joblessness.
""These numbers show the scale of the challenge inherited by the Obama Administration, with a historic increase in need during the two years before we took office,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""The report shows a clear link between unemployment and housing needs and that's why the President has been so focused on creating jobs. A growing economy and new jobs, combined with HUD's new commitments to produce and preserve affordable rental housing is what we need to reverse this trend.""
Dr. Raphael Bostic, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research, said, ""The loss of income and the general lack of affordable housing are clearly putting a lot of stress on unassisted families at the lower end of the income spectrum. It's equally clear that had it not been for housing assistance offered by HUD, the economic impact on very low-income renters would have been greater still.""
These worst case housing needs are defined as renters with very low incomes (below half the median in their area) who do not receive government housing assistance and who either paid more than half their monthly incomes for rent, lived in severely substandard conditions, or both. HUD's report finds that needs cut across all regions of the country and included all racial and ethnic groups, regardless of whether they lived in cities, suburbs or rural areas. In addition, HUD concluded that large numbers of worst case needs were also found across various family types including families with children, senior citizens, and persons with disabilities.
The increase in the extent of worst case housing needs represents the largest two-year jump since HUD began reporting this segment of the rental market in 1985. Unemployment and under-employment pushed 410,000 more households into the worst case needs category accounting for more than one-third of all new cases.
HUD's report found:
Worst case housing needs were 7.10 million in 2009 (41 percent of very low-income renters), up from 5.91 million (37 percent). This represents more than a 20 percent increase from the number of worst case needs in 2007. Every racial/ethnic group experienced increases in worst case housing needs during 2007-2009 with Hispanic households having the largest increase in incidence (8 percentage points). Higher income families are competing for a limited number of affordable rental units further driving down already-low vacancy rates for the lowest rent units. Only 36 of every 100 extremely low-income renters have affordable units available to them. Dramatic increases in worst case needs were caused by shrinking incomes as well as rent increases due to increased competition among low-income families for fewer affordable units. Worst case needs among renters with disabilities increased from 37.5 percent to 40.7 percent (of all very low-income renters with disabilities). The availability of affordable rental housing varies across regions of the country with supply most scarce in the West, where only 53 units available per 100 very low-income renter households, compared with 65 in the South, 66 in the Northeast and 87 in the Midwest.

Government housing assistance programs, including those provided by HUD, significantly reduce worst case needs and homelessness but are not available for all those who need assistance. Nationwide, 25 percent of the very poor receive some form of rental assistance.
The Obama Administration has been taking strong action to respond to the decline in family incomes and increase in need for affordable housing:
Recovery Act - Nearly 341,000 units of affordable housing are rehabilitated or constructed through the Recovery Act's Tax Credit Assistance Program and Public Housing Capital Fund. In addition, the Recovery Act guaranteed rental subsidy to approximately 1.2 million units of affordable housing through HUD's Project-based Rental Assistance Program. Meanwhile, the Recovery Act's Homeless Prevention and Rapid Re-housing Program prevented or ended homelessness for more than 750,000 persons. Opening Doors - In June, the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH) unveiled Opening Doors (www.usich.gov/OpeningDoors.html), the nation's first comprehensive strategy to prevent and end homelessness. The plan puts the country on a path to end veteran and chronic homelessness by 2015; and to ending homelessness among children, family, and youth by 2020. National Housing Trust Fund - The Obama Administration is seeking $1 billion to invest in thousands of new affordable housing units targeted to the nation's lowest income families.

Under the Administration's comprehensive strategy to preserve and enhance the country's affordable housing stock, HUD would allow public housing owners' access to safe, reliable public and private funding to renovate their properties - unlocking an estimated $7 billion the first year and as much as $25 billion in the years to come.

02/10/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-014.cfm,HUD and VA Issue First-Ever Report on Veteran Homelessness in America,"WASHINGTON - For the first time ever, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) today published the most authoritative analysis of the extent and nature of homelessness among American veterans. According to HUD and VA's assessment, nearly 76,000 veterans were homeless on a given night in 2009 while roughly 136,000 veterans spent at least one night in a shelter during that year.
This unprecedented assessment is based on an annual report HUD provides to Congress and explores in greater depth the demographics of veterans who are homeless, how veterans compare to others who are homeless, and how veterans access and use the nation's homeless response system. Read Veteran Homelessness: A Supplement to the 2009 Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress.
""This report offers a much clearer picture about what it means to be a veteran living on our streets or in our shelters,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""Understanding the nature and scope of veteran homelessness is critical to meeting President Obama's goal of ending veterans' homelessness within five years.""
""With our federal, state and community partners working together, more Veterans are moving into safe housing,"" said Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric K. Shinseki. ""But we're not done yet. Providing assistance in mental health, substance abuse treatment, education and employment goes hand-in-hand with preventive steps and permanent supportive housing. We continue to work towards our goal of finding every Veteran safe housing and access to needed services.""
Last June, President Obama announced the nation's first comprehensive strategy to prevent and end homelessness, including a focus on homeless veterans.

Read more about the Administration's strategic plan to prevent and end homelessness in America (www.usich.gov/PDF/OpeningDoorsOverview.pdf).
Key findings of the report released today include:
More than 3,000 cities and counties reported 75,609 homeless veterans on a single night in January of 2009; 57 percent were staying in an emergency shelter or transitional housing program while the remaining 43 percent were unsheltered. Veterans represent approximately 12 percent of all homeless persons counted nationwide during the 2009 'point-in-time snapshot.' During a 12-month period in 2009, an estimated 136,000 veterans—or about 1 in every 168 veterans—spent at least one night in an emergency shelter or transitional housing program. The vast majority of sheltered homeless veterans (96 percent) experienced homelessness alone while a much smaller share (four percent) was part of a family. Sheltered homeless veterans are most often individual white men between the ages of 31 and 50 and living with a disability. Veterans are fifty percent more likely to become homeless compared to all Americans and the risk is even greater among veterans living in poverty and poor minority veterans. HUD and VA examined the likelihood of becoming homeless among American veterans with particular demographic characteristics and found that during 2009, twice as many poor Hispanic veterans used a shelter compared with poor non-Hispanic veterans. African American veterans in poverty had similar rates of homelessness. Most veterans who used emergency shelter stayed for only brief periods. One-third stayed in shelter for less than one week; 61 percent used a shelter for less than one month; and 84percent stayed for less than three months. The report also concluded that veterans remained in shelters longer than did non-veterans. In 2009, the median length of stay for veterans who were alone was 21 days in an emergency shelter and 117 days in transitional housing. By contrast, non-veteran individuals stayed in an emergency shelter for 17 days and 106 days in transitional housing. Nearly half of homeless veterans were located in California, Texas, New York and Florida while only 28 percent of all veterans were located in those same four States. Sheltered homeless veterans are far more likely to be alone rather than part of a family household; 96 percent of veterans are individuals compared to 66 percent in the overall homeless population.

HUD and VA are currently working together to administer a joint program specifically targeted to homeless veterans. Through the HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) Program, HUD provides rental assistance for homeless veterans while VA offers case management and clinical services. Since 2008, a total investment of $225 million is working to provide housing and supportive service for approximately 30,000 veterans who would otherwise be homeless.
In addition, last month HUD awarded $1.4 billion to keep nearly 7,000 local homeless assistance programs operating in the coming year. The Department also allocated $1.5 billion through its new Homeless Prevention and Rapid Re-housing (HPRP) Program. Made possible through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, HPRP is intended to prevent persons from falling into homelessness or to rapidly re-house them if they do. To date, more than 850,000 persons, including more than 15,000 veterans, have been assisted through HPRP."

The Administration's plan will wind down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and shrink the government's current footprint in housing finance on a responsible timeline. The plan also lays out reforms to continue fixing the fundamental flaws in the mortgage market through stronger consumer protection, increased transparency for investors, improved underwriting standards, and other critical measures. Additionally, it will help provide targeted and transparent support to creditworthy but underserved families that want to own their own home, as well as affordable rental options.
""This is a plan for fundamental reform to wind down the GSEs, strengthen consumer protection, and preserve access to affordable housing for people who need it,"" said Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner. ""We are going to start the process of reform now, but we are going to do it responsibly and carefully so that we support the recovery and the process of repair of the housing market.""
""This report provides a strong plan to fix the fundamental flaws in the mortgage market and better target the government's support for affordable homeownership and rental housing,"" said Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""We must continue to take the necessary steps to ensure that Americans have access to quality housing they can afford. This involves rebalancing our housing priorities to support a range of affordable options, from promoting much-needed financing for quality, affordable rental homes to ensuring the availability of safe, and sustainable mortgage products for current and future homeowners.""
The Obama Administration's reform plan will:
Wind Down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and Help Bring Private Capital Back to the Market. In the wake of the financial crisis, private capital retreated from the housing market and has not yet returned, leaving the government to guarantee more than nine out of every 10 new mortgages. That assistance has been essential to stabilizing the housing market. However, the Obama Administration believes that, under normal market conditions, the private sector subject to stronger oversight and standards for consumer and investor protection should be the primary source of mortgage credit and bear the burden for losses.

The Obama Administration is committed to proceeding with great care as we work toward the objective of ensuring that government support is withdrawn at a responsible pace that does not undermine the economic recovery.
Phasing in Increased Pricing at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to Make Room for Private Capital, Level the Playing Field. The Administration recommends ending unfair capital advantages that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac previously enjoyed by requiring them to price their guarantees as though they were held to the same capital standards as private banks or financial institutions. This will help level the playing field for the private sector to take back market share. Although the pace of these increases will depend significantly on market conditions, the Administration recommends bringing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to a level even with the private market over the next several years. Reducing Conforming Loan Limits. To further reduce Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's presence in the market, the Administration recommends that Congress allow the temporary increase in those firms' conforming loan limits (the maximum size of a loan those firms can guarantee) to reset as scheduled on October 1, 2011 to the levels set in the Housing and Economic Recovery Act (HERA). We will work with Congress on additional changes to conforming limits going forward. Phasing in 10 Percent Down Payment Requirement: To help further protect taxpayers, we recommend requiring larger down payments from borrowers. Going forward, we support gradually increasing required down payments so that any mortgage that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guarantee eventually has at least a 10 percent down payment. Winding Down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's Investment Portfolios: The Administration's plan calls for continuing to wind down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's investment portfolio at an annual rate of no less than 10 percent per year. Returning Federal Housing Administration (FHA) to its Traditional Role. As Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's presence in the market shrinks, we will encourage program changes at FHA to ensure that the private sector not FHA picks up this new market share. The Administration recommends that Congress allow the present increase in FHA conforming loan limits to expire as scheduled on October 1, 2011, after which it will explore further reductions. The Administration will also put in place a 25 basis point increase in the price of FHA's annual mortgage insurance premium, as detailed in the President's 2012 Budget.

Throughout the transition, we remain committed to ensuring that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have sufficient capital to perform under any guarantees issued now or in the future and the ability to meet any of their debt obligations. This assurance is essential to continued economic stability.
We recognize the critically important role that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and their employees have played in the housing finance market while they have operated in conservatorship. We look forward to continuing to work with them to find ways to develop and implement the longer term reform solutions that the Administration determines together with Congress.
Fix the Fundamental Flaws in the Mortgage Market. The Obama Administration is committed to fixing the fundamental flaws in the housing finance chain. That process is already underway as we move to fundamentally transform the mortgage market through the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act's (Dodd-Frank Act's) critical reforms. Implementing these key measures, as well as additional reforms outlined in this report, will help to strengthen the long-term health of the mortgage market for borrowers, lenders, and investors. Helping Consumers Avoid Unfair Practices and Make Informed Decisions About Mortgages: The Administration will continue to implement the Dodd-Frank Act's reforms to strengthen anti-predatory lending protections, improve underwriting standards, require lenders to verify a borrowers' ability to pay, and provide increased mortgage disclosures for consumers. Increasing Accountability and Transparency in the Securitization Process: The Administration is currently working on rules to require originators and securitizers to keep greater ""skin in the game"" and to align incentives across the securitization chain. Dodd-Frank charged the SEC with setting stricter disclosure requirements so that investors can more easily understand the underlying risks of securities, and establishing an Office of Credit Ratings to more effectively regulate the credit rating agencies. Creating a More Stable Mortgage Market: The Administration supports stronger capital standards to help ensure that banks can better withstand future downturns, declines in home prices and other sudden shocks, without jeopardizing the health of the economy. Additionally, the comprehensive reforms undertaken pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act to constrain excessive risk in the financial system, including strengthened and coordinated oversight through the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), will help build a healthier and more stable mortgage market for the long term. Servicing and Foreclosure Processes: The Administration supports several immediate and near-term reforms to correct problems in mortgage servicing and foreclosure processing to better serve both homeowners and investors. These include putting in place national standards for mortgage servicing; reforming servicing compensation to help ensure servicers have proper incentives to invest the time and effort necessary to work with borrowers to avoid default or foreclosure; requiring that mortgage documents disclose the presence of second liens and define the process for modifying a second lien in the event the first lien becomes delinquent; and considering options for allowing primary mortgage holders to restrict, in certain circumstances, additional debt secured by the same property. Forming a New Task Force on Coordinating and Consolidating Existing Housing Finance Agencies: Following on the President's call in the State of the Union to reform government to build a stronger future, the Administration will create a task force to explore ways in which the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Department of Agriculture, and the Department of Veterans' Affairs housing finance programs can be better coordinated, or even consolidated. Better Target the Government's Support for Affordable Housing. The Administration believes that we must continue to help ensure that Americans have access to quality housing they can afford. This does not mean, however, that our goal is for all Americans to become homeowners. Instead, we should make sure opportunities are available for all Americans who have the credit history, financial capacity, and desire to own a home have the opportunity to take that step. At the same time, we should ensure that there are a range of affordable options for the millions of Americans who rent, whether they do so by choice or financial necessity. Moving forward, we must design access and affordability policies that are better targeted and focused on providing support that is financially sustainable for families and communities. The Administration recommends initially focusing our efforts on four primary areas: Reforming and Strengthening the FHA: We will continue to ensure that creditworthy borrowers who have incomes up to the median level for their area have access to affordable mortgages, but we will do so in a way that is healthy for FHA's long-term finances, including considering options such as lowering the maximum loan-to-value ratios for qualifying mortgages and adjusting pricing. Rebalancing our Housing policy and Strengthening Support for Affordable Rental Housing: The plan advocates additional support for rental housing through measures that could include expanding the FHA's capacity to support lending to the multifamily market, with reforms like risk sharing with private lenders and dedicated programs for hard to reach property segments like smaller properties. Ensuring that Capital is Available to Credit-worthy Borrowers in All Communities, Including Rural Areas, Economically Distressed Regions, and Low-income Communities: The plan calls for greater transparency by requiring securitizers to disclose information on the credit, geographic, and demographic characteristics of the loans they package into securities. The Administration will explore other measures to make sure that secondary market participants are providing capital to all communities in ways that reflect activity in the private market, consistent with their obligations of safety and soundness. Supporting a Dedicated Funding Source for Targeted Access and Affordability Initiatives: The plan calls for a dedicated, budget neutral, financing mechanism to support homeownership and rental housing objectives. The Administration will work with Congress on developing this funding mechanism going forward. Longer-Term Reform Choices. The report also puts forward longer-term reform choices for structuring the government's future role in the housing market. Each of these options would produce a market where the private sector plays the dominant role in providing mortgage credit and bears the burden for losses, but each also has unique advantages and disadvantages that we must consider carefully.

The Obama Administration looks forward to working to build consensus, on a bipartisan basis, with a wide range of stakeholders on this issue.

02/11/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-015.cfm,HUD Announces Additional $50 Million to Help Tennessee Communities Recover from 2010 Disaster,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Shaun Donovan today announced an additional $50 million in disaster funding to help Tennessee communities recover from last spring's devastating storms and flooding. Provided through HUD's Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program, these grants will supplement $24 million awarded by HUD last September to support long-term disaster recovery efforts throughout the Volunteer State.
""When we studied the impact of these storms, the information on damages demonstrated pretty clearly that Tennessee was disproportionately impacted and still has a lot of work ahead of it to get back on its feet,"" said Donovan. ""These funds, along with the last year's investment, will go a long way toward helping these communities rebuild.""
Last summer, Congress appropriated a total of $100 million and directed HUD to allocate the funds to various States and local communities to address unmet disaster recovery needs relating to flooding that occurred in the spring of 2010. HUD calculated unmet needs for housing, business, and infrastructure recovery based on data provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Small Business Administration.
As a result of these calculations, HUD's allocations are:"
02/14/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-013.cfm,FHA Takes Steps to Bolster Capital Reserves,"WASHINGTON - As part of ongoing efforts to strengthen the Federal Housing Administration's (FHA) capital reserves, FHA Commissioner David H. Stevens today announced a new premium structure for FHA-insured mortgage loans increasing its annual mortgage insurance premium (MIP) by a quarter of a percentage point (.25) on all 30- and 15-year loans. The upfront MIP will remain unchanged at 1.0 percent. This premium change was detailed in President Obama's fiscal year 2012 budget, also released today, and will impact new loans insured by FHA on or after April 18, 2011.
""After careful consideration and analysis, we determined it was necessary to increase the annual mortgage insurance premium at this time in order to bolster the FHA's capital reserves and help private capital return to the housing market,"" said Stevens. ""This quarter point increase in the annual MIP is a responsible step towards meeting the Congressionally mandated two percent reserve threshold, while allowing FHA to remain the most cost effective mortgage insurance option for borrowers with lower incomes and lower down payments.""
The proposed change was announced last week as part of the Obama Administration's report to Congress, which outlined the Administration's plan to reform the nation's housing finance system. The Administration's housing finance plan also recommended that Congress allow the present increase in FHA conforming loan limits to expire as scheduled on October 1, 2011.
This premium change enables FHA to increase revenues at a time that is critical to the ongoing stability of its Mutual Mortgage Insurance (MMI) fund, which had capital reserves of approximately $3.6 billion at the end of FY 2010. The change is estimated to contribute nearly $3 billion annually to the Fund, based on current volume projections. It is vital that HUD take action to ensure that FHA will continue to serve its dual mission of providing affordable homeownership options to underserved American families and first-time homebuyers while helping to stabilize the housing market during these tough times.
On average, new FHA borrowers will pay approximately $30 more per month. This marginal increase is affordable for almost all homebuyers who would qualify for a new loan. Existing and HECM loans insured by FHA are not impacted by the pricing change.
FHA will continue to play an important role in the nation's mortgage market in 2011. President Obama's FY 2012 budget projects the FHA will insure $218 billion in mortgage borrowing in 2012. These guarantees will support new home purchases and re-financed mortgages that significantly reduce borrower payments.

02/14/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-016.cfm,HUD Releases Proposed Fy2012 Budget,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Shaun Donovan today unveiled HUD's fiscal year 2012 budget proposal. Titled Creating Strong, Sustainable, Inclusive Communities and Quality Affordable Homes the budget seeks to help lead America out of an unprecedented economic crisis and ensure our economy is competitive - growing and working for all Americans. HUD is taking responsibility for our deficit, by investing in what makes America stronger and cutting what doesn't.
The budget provides a roadmap for HUD to work with our regional and local partners to win the future by investing in innovation, building neighborhoods that are connected to jobs and providing greater access to opportunity, so American businesses and communities are the best in the world,"" said Donovan. ""The President has said that we need to live within our means to invest in the future. That has meant tough choices, including to programs that, absent the fiscal situation, we would not cut. But American families are tightening their belts and we need to do the same.""
The President is submitting this budget in an economic environment that is significantly improved from when the he took office. An economy that was shrinking is growing again - and instead of rapid job loss, more than a million private sector jobs were created in the last year. But there's still more work to be done to ensure that America and its workers can compete and win in the 21st century. HUD's FY 2012 budget tackles these challenges head on in the following ways:
by helping responsible families at risk of losing their homes and meeting the need for quality affordable rental housing; by transforming neighborhoods of poverty and ensuring that children there have access to the quality education we need to compete in the 21st century; by rebuilding the national resource that is our federally-assisted public housing stock and ensuring that its tenants are part of the mobile, skilled workforce our new global economy requires; and, by leveraging private sector investments in communities to create jobs and generate the economic growth we need to out-innovate, out-educate and out-build the rest of the world.
• by helping responsible families at risk of losing their homes and meeting the need for quality affordable rental housing;

• by leveraging private sector investments in communities to create jobs and generate the economic growth we need to out-innovate, out-educate and out-build the rest of the world.
HUD's budget also reflects the need to ensure that America's future isn't built on a mountain of debt. As a down payment toward reducing the deficit, the President has proposed a freeze on domestic spending for the next five years, cutting the deficit by $400 billion over 10 years and bringing non-security discretionary spending to the lowest share of the economy since President Eisenhower. Every department shares a responsibility to make tough cuts so there's room for investments to speed economic growth. HUD's fiscal year 2012 budget more than meets the President's goal:
The Department's $47.8 billion in gross budget authority is offset by $6 billion in projected FHA and Ginnie Mae receipts credited to HUD's appropriations accounts, leaving net budget authority of $41.7 billion, or 2.8% below the fiscal year 2010 actual level of $42.9 billion. To maintain this commitment to fiscal discipline, HUD will protect existing residents and made the difficult choice to reduce funding for new units and projects, including cuts to the Community Development Block Grant, HOME Investment Partnerships, and new construction components of the Supportive Housing Programs for the Elderly (202) and Disabled (811).
• The Department's $47.8 billion in gross budget authority is offset by $6 billion in projected FHA and Ginnie Mae receipts credited to HUD's appropriations accounts, leaving net budget authority of $41.7 billion, or 2.8% below the fiscal year 2010 actual level of $42.9 billion.

And because meeting the President's State of the Union charge to ""Win the Future"" also means reforming government so it's leaner, more transparent, and ready for the 21st century, HUD proposes reforming the administrative infrastructure that oversees its programs.
Through the Section 8 Voucher Reform Act legislative proposal that is part of this budget, HUD will simplify and rationalize the rent setting provisions of our largest program, yielding—if enacted—over $150 million in savings in the first year and over $1 billion in savings over the next half decade. Finally, the Transformation Initiative—important funding and programmatic flexibility Congress provided in 2010—is enabling HUD to conduct the kinds of research and demonstrations that will ensure that we are funding what works and identifying what doesn't and what we need to do better.

""Equally important, it expresses the confidence of the President in the capacity of HUD to meet a high standard of performance. In short, while it requires hard choices to reduce the deficit, this blueprint for fiscal year 2012 is one that will deliver results for the vulnerable people and often-distressed places that HUD helps.""

02/15/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-018.cfm,"HUD Launches ""Evidence Matters,"" A New Independent Quarterly Publication Focused on Research-Based Policy","WASHINGTON - In an effort to promote a new generation of data-driven and evidence-based policymaking, U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan today unveiled a new quarterly publication intended to inform housing and community development advocates, state and local policymakers, Congress and researchers on new approaches to issues related to housing and community development. Evidence Matters is an objective, unbiased publication intended to inform the broad housing and community development field on future policy directions based on research and data - in short, the evidence.
""As a self-professed policy wonk, I'm excited that HUD is focused on having an honest and informed discussion about what works and what doesn't,"" said Donovan. ""Evidence does indeed matter when it comes to making policy that impacts people's lives and this publication will help frame the discussion around what the data means.""
The inaugural issue of Evidence Matters (Choice Neighborhoods: History and HOPE) focuses on strategies to revitalize neighborhoods of concentrated poverty including HUD's HOPE VI program. One central observation is that while HOPE VI can show significant positive impacts, one of the program's main challenges is its inability to consistently improve multi-facteted problems in residents' lives as it has in improving housing conditions and surrounding communities.
As HUD's Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research, Dr. Raphael Bostic said, ""We know that neighborhoods of concentrated poverty struggle with unemployment, crime, and poor schools and health care. Many federal interventions focus on assisting poor households in particular neighborhoods but have failed to take a broader community-based approach. The evidence points to the need for a more holistic strategy to redevelopment if we hope to improve the lives of residents as well as the places where they live.""

02/17/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-019.cfm,HUD Charges New York Owner and Management Company with Discrimination,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced that it is charging the owner and management company of an apartment complex in the Town of Oyster Bay in Long Island, New York with violating the Fair Housing Act for allegedly denying an accessible parking space to a resident with disabilities. Additionally, HUD's charge alleges that 4 Anchorage Lane Owners, Inc. and Total Community Management Corp. refused to modify its parking policy to accommodate the resident's request.
The Fair Housing Act requires landlords to make reasonable accommodations in their rules, policies, practices, or services when needed to provide persons with disabilities an equal opportunity to use or enjoy a dwelling.
""A parking space that provides easier access to and from their residence can mean all the difference to a person with disabilities' participation in daily life,"" stated John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Since 1988, the Fair Housing Act is our authority and obligation to ensure reasonable accommodations. HUD will vigorously enforce the law to protect the housing rights of tenants living with disabilities.""
According to HUD's charge, the owner and manager of the apartment complex repeatedly denied a disabled tenant's requests for a reasonable accommodation in the form of an assigned accessible parking space. The resident suffers from neuropathy, a neurological disease that makes it impossible for him to walk long distances and maintain balance. Unable to reserve one of the two designated handicap parking spaces closest to the entrance, the tenant was forced to compete for an accessible space with other residents or park further away from his apartment. The owner and manager refused to accommodate his request, stating management was in full compliance with local codes for providing accessible parking for all residents.
The HUD charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages to aggrieved persons for the damages caused them by the discrimination.
The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief to deter further discrimination, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose fines in order to vindicate the public interest. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages to aggrieved persons.
FHEO and its partners in the Fair Housing Assistance Program investigate more than 10,000 housing discrimination complaints annually. People who believe they are the victims of housing discrimination should contact HUD at 1-800-669-9777 (voice), 800-927-9275 (TTY)."
02/18/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-020.cfm,"HUD, FEMA Extend Disaster Housing Assistance for Gustav/Ike Survivors in Louisiana and Texas","WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan and Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Craig Fugate today announced an additional five-month extension of disaster housing assistance to more than 5,168 families in Texas and Louisiana who were displaced by Hurricanes Ike and Gustav. The extension of rental assistance through the Disaster Housing Assistance Program (DHAP) gives these families until September 30th to transition to permanent housing solutions.
This extension will give 3,425 families in Texas and 1,743 families in Louisiana who continue to participate in DHAP-Ike another five months to transition from the program. Since November, 2008, the DHAP program provided temporary rental assistance to families and was scheduled to end on March 31, 2011.
HUD and FEMA established the program through an Inter-Agency Agreement to assist homeowners and renters who were displaced by Hurricanes Gustav and Ike with up to 17 months of temporary housing assistance and case management. FEMA and HUD extended the program to allow for a total of 35 months of potential program eligibility based on the States of Louisiana and Texas requests.
This program provides full rental payments to participating families for the first six months. On May 1, 2009, families began paying $50 towards the rent and each month thereafter, the tenant's portion of the rent increased by $50 until the tenant began paying the full rent or ended their participation in the program. The incremental rent payments will continue during this extension period. After May 2009, families whose housing expenses - rent and mortgage for personal residences that remained uninhabitable - exceeded 30 percent of their post-disaster income, and who also met other program requirements, continued receiving DHAP-Ike assistance. DHAP-Ike subsidized eligible families' rent anywhere in the United States.
In February 2010, President Obama's budget requested an additional $66 million specifically directed to allow HUD to support disaster vouchers for families affected by Hurricanes Ike and Gustav. The Administration will continue to work with Congress through the 2011 appropriations process to provide the funding necessary to transition the remaining families to more permanent accommodations.

02/25/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-021.cfm,HUD Issues Guidance on Discrimination Complaints from Victims of Domestic Violence,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) recently issued guidance making it clear that residents who are denied or evicted from housing as a result of domestic violence may have basis to file a discrimination complaint with HUD under the federal Fair Housing Act. HUD's guidance states that while the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) provides some protections to victims of abuse who experience housing discrimination, the Fair Housing Act provides authority for HUD to investigate whether the denial or eviction violates the Act based on gender or another federally-protected basis.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits landlords from discriminating based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, and disability.
""People in abusive relationships are not only victims of abuse, but potential victims of housing discrimination,"" said John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Evicting a domestic violence victim from her home robs her of the one anchor she has in a sea of uncertainty. HUD is committed to using the Fair Housing Act to protect victims of abuse from unlawful denial of access to decent, affordable housing.""
Under the guidance, HUD will review claims of discrimination from victims of domestic violence to determine if there is sufficient evidence to apply the Fair Housing Act to those complaints. For example, a landlord refusing to accept women with a history of domestic violence because they may return to abusive men may violate the Fair Housing Act's prohibition against gender discrimination. Similarly, a ""zero-tolerance"" policy for criminal activity, under which an entire household may be evicted for the criminal act of one household member, may have a disparate impact on women because they are the overwhelming majority of domestic violence victims. Evicting women for the violent acts of their abusers may violate the Fair Housing Act.
Additionally, the guidance provides examples of recent housing discrimination cases and explains how VAWA protects victims of domestic violence from denial, eviction and termination from public housing and the Housing Choice Voucher Program (Section 8).
To read HUD's Domestic Violence guidance go to HUD's website.
The Department's domestic violence forms, HUD form 91066, ""Certification of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence or Stalking"" and HUD form 91067, ""Lease Addendum - Violence Against Women and Justice Department Reauthorization Act of 2005,"" are available in 14 different languages on HUD's Limited English Proficiency Web site."
02/28/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-022.cfm,HUD Approves $29 Million Refinancing for Riverside Hospital,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced a commitment to insure a mortgage loan to Parkview Community Hospital Medical Center in Riverside, California. The $29 million loan is made possible through the Section 223(f) component of the Federal Housing Administration's (FHA) Section 242 Hospital Mortgage Insurance Program.
Parkview is the first hospital to refinance debt through Section 223(f). The program provides for refinancing of a hospital's debts without conditioning such refinancing on new construction or renovation.
""This refinance program is designed to help hospitals struggling with high interest rates and limited credit options,"" said FHA Commissioner David Stevens. ""The savings provided through FHA refinancing will help hospitals like Parkview hold down the cost of healthcare and better serve the community.""
Parkview is a 193-bed acute care hospital that has served the Riverside area for more than 50 years. It is currently paying 20 percent interest on its existing debt. The new FHA-insured mortgage will have an interest rate of approximately 7 percent, saving the hospital almost $3 million per year. In addition, the new mortgage will provide the hospital with funds to purchase $1.8 million in medical equipment to upgrade the facility's Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.
HUD estimates Parkview Community Hospital Medical Center generates more than $300 million in annual economic activity and supports a total of 2,223 jobs in the community. More than 600 workers are employed by the hospital. HUD's estimates are based on results from an economic model used by public and private institutions to examine a variety of economic development issues.
Since 1968, FHA has insured 395 mortgage loans totaling $17 billion to hospitals in 43 states and Puerto Rico. The Section 242 program serves the full spectrum of acute care hospitals, including small rural hospitals, inner-city hospitals, and large academic medical centers."
03/01/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-023.cfm,HUD Awards over $40 Million in Grants to Fight Housing and Lending Discrimination,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today awarded $40.8 million to 108 fair housing organizations and non-profit agencies in 36 states and the District of Columbia to educate the public and combat housing and lending discrimination (see attached list of grantees). This year's award represents a $13.2 million increase over last year's award and includes $10 million to fund activities that address lending discrimination, including mortgage rescue scams.
""The record increase in support to local fair housing and community organizations demonstrates the Obama Administration's firm commitment to ending housing discrimination and providing help to families victimized by mortgage scams,"" stated HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan.
""Ending housing discrimination takes more than the efforts of Washington,"" said John Trasviña, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing & Equal Opportunity. ""These grants enable community groups all over the nation to help HUD enforce the Fair Housing Act, make the public more aware of their fair housing rights and ensure that housing providers understand their responsibilities under the law.""
The grants announced today are funded through HUD's Fair Housing Initiatives Program (FHIP)and will be used to investigate allegations of housing discrimination, educate the public and the housing industry about their rights and responsibilities under the Fair Housing Act, and work to promote equal housing opportunities.
The categories grants were awarded in include:
Private Enforcement Initiative grants (PEI) - HUD awarded $28 million to support organization that investigate alleged housing discrimination, and enforce the Fair Housing Act and state and local laws that are substantially equivalent to the Act. Groups will also use the funding to conduct testing to protect individuals living in minority neighborhoods from mortgage rescue scams. Education and Outreach Initiative grants (EOI) - HUD awarded $6.8 million to organizations that educate the public and housing providers about their rights and obligations under federal, state, and local fair housing laws. Groups will also conduct fair lending workshops, community meetings, and individual counseling activities focused on homeowners at risk for discrimination. Fair Housing Organizations Initiative grants (FHOI) - HUD awarded $6 million to organizations serving rural and immigrant populations in areas lacking existing fair housing organizations, or otherwise underserved. Included will be activities that provide direct assistance to victims of fraudulent or predatory mortgage rescue schemes.

03/01/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-025.cfm,HUD Awards Nearly $8 Million for Asthma Intervention and to Protect Thousands of Children from Health Hazards in Their Homes,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today is awarding $7.8 million in grants to 14 local projects in nine states to conduct a wide range of activities such as research on the cost effectiveness of home-based interventions for children with asthma and novel strategies for reducing risks from lead-contaminated soil and house dust (see attached). For the first time, HUD is awarding $2 million of those grants to improve indoor environmental conditions and links to education and medical services for asthmatic children and other residents living in public and assisted multifamily housing.
Lead is a known toxin that can impair children's development and have effects lasting into adulthood. It's estimated that asthma alone costs the U.S. economy approximately $3.5 billion each year. Approximately 16.4 million Americans currently have asthma, including nearly 7 million children 18 years of age and younger.
""Homes with lead or other health hazards can injure children and worsen conditions such as asthma and HUD wants to ensure that children have a healthy place to call home,"" said Jon Gant, Director of HUD's Office of Healthy Homes and Lead Hazard Control. ""These grants will not only help to clean up lead and other home health hazards but will support the development of innovative new approaches to improve and control asthma in children.""
The following is a breakdown of the funding announced today:
Through these three programs, HUD's Office of Healthy Homes and Lead Hazard Control supports research to eliminate dangerous lead and other key housing-related hazards from lower income homes; improves our knowledge of the benefits of green construction and maintenance practices for low income housing; and stimulates the implementation and evaluation of housing management practices to improve the health of asthmatic children and the quality of life of their caregivers.
The funds announced today are provided through HUD's, Healthy Homes Technical Studies, Lead Technical Studies, and Asthma Interventions in Public and Assisted Multifamily Housing grant programs.
Even though lead-based paint was banned for use in the home in 1978, HUD estimates that approximately 24 million homes still have significant lead-based paint hazards today. Lead-contaminated dust is the primary cause of lead exposure and can lead to a variety of health problems in young children, including reduced IQ, learning disabilities, developmental delays, reduced height, and impaired hearing. At higher levels, lead can damage a child's kidneys and central nervous system and cause anemia, coma, convulsions and even death.However, lead is not the only danger threatening families and children in the home. Asthma is now recognized as a leading cause of school and work absences, emergency room visits, and hospitalizations that disproportionately impacts low income, minority populations.

03/02/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-024.cfm,HUD Awards Nearly $50 Million to Boost Local Economic Development and Affordable Housing Programs,"WASHINGTON - More than 250 communities across the country will be able to increase the economic impact of their local community development and affordable housing programs through nearly $50 million in ""capacity-building"" grants awarded today by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The funds awarded today will support three national organizations and are ultimately expected to produce approximately 8,000 units of affordable housing nationwide, and generate more than $1 billion in total development investment.
Three national groups were selected to distribute the funds to local initiatives that support affordable housing and community development - Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC); Enterprise Community Partners, Inc.; and Habitat for Humanity International (see attached list).
As part of HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan's strategic goal of transforming the way the Department does business, these grants are being awarded in an unprecedented 33 days after the application deadline compared to 124 days last year.
""These funds act as 'multipliers'. By helping to build the capacity of local community-based housing and development organizations, we're able to at least triple the impact of taxpayer dollars at the local level and, in today's fiscal environment, that's not just good government, that's intelligent government,"" said Mercedes Mãrquez, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development.
HUD's Section 4 Capacity Building for Community Development and Affordable Housing Program encourages open competition among larger nonprofit groups and others while increasing technical and administrative support of projects that provideadequate housing, education, employment and shopping, safe streets and transportation. Because HUD's capacity building grant program requires a minimum three-to-one private/public match, today's grants will stimulate nearly $150 million in investments nationwide, and more than $1 billion in total development costs channeled to low- and moderate-income families.
The national groups awarded funding today will work with community development corporations, community housing development organizations (CHDOS) to carry out community development and affordable housing activities. This partnership will help to rebuild and revitalize neighborhoods, and improve the lives of residents by creating affordable housing opportunities and jobs through community and economic development activities that would not otherwise have occurred.
With the awards granted today, HUD expects that approximately 8,000 housing units will be built, renovated, or preserved, 1000 training opportunities will be offered, and more than $1 billion in total development investment will be channeled to low- and moderate-income communities in more than 250 communities nationwide. Since 2008, HUD's Section 4 capacity-building grants constructed, renovated or preserved nearly 31,000 homes; provided 2,325 training opportunities for community development organizations (CDC) or community housing development organizations (CHDO); and stimulated $5.4 billion in total development activity. During that time, more than 1,000 different CDCs and CHDOs in 565 cities in 48 states were assisted directly."

The latest housing figures show increased existing home sales as home affordability remains high, but officials caution that the market remains fragile, as prices are unsettled.
""In the face of the deepest economic recession and housing crisis in decades, the Obama Administration has taken unprecedented action to promote stability in the market - keeping millions of families in their homes and helping millions more to save money by refinancing. But the data clearly show that the market remains extremely fragile,"" said HUD Assistant Secretary Raphael Bostic. ""While we cannot stop every foreclosure, we know that many responsible homeowners are still fighting to make ends meet. Through the broad range of programs this Administration has put in place, we can put help in reach to those homeowners as early as possible.""
""Our housing market remains fragile. We know this from data, but homeowners across the country can feel it too. That's why this Administration remains committed to helping eligible homeowners avoid foreclosure where it makes economic sense to do so,"" said acting Assistant Secretary for Financial Stability Tim Massad. ""Every month, HAMP continues to help tens of thousands of additional families in a cost-effective manner. And by setting affordability standards and developing a framework for how mortgage servicers provide assistance to struggling families, HAMP has established critical protections for homeowners and has catalyzed improvements in modifications industry-wide.""
Available online at www.hud.gov/scorecard, the February Housing Scorecard features key data on the health of the housing market including:
Housing market remains fragile as data through January paint a mixed picture of recovery. Existing home sales ticked upward in January, but remained below levels seen in the first half of 2010. Mortgage delinquencies continued a downward trend compared to early 2010 and foreclosure starts and completions remain below peak. However, as lenders review internal procedures related to foreclosure processing, many foreclosure actions have been delayed. The decline is likely to be temporary as lenders eventually revise and resubmit foreclosure paperwork in the coming months. Administration efforts have been effective in blunting the effects of the deepest economic crisis since the Great Depression. Since April of 2009, record low mortgage rates have helped more than 9.5 million homeowners to refinance, resulting in $18.1 billion in total borrower savings. However, home prices remain unsettled at this fragile stage of the recovery. More than 4.2 million modification arrangements were started between April 2009 and the end of January 2011 - including nearly 1.5 million HAMP trial modification starts, more than 730,000 FHA loss mitigation and early delinquency interventions, and more than 2 million proprietary modifications under HOPE Now. While some homeowners may have received help from more than one program, the number of agreements offered was more than double the number of foreclosure completions for the same period (1.8 million). View the January HAMP Servicer Performance Report (www.treasury.gov/initiatives/financial-stability/results/MHA-Reports/Pages/default.aspx).

03/09/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-028.cfm,"Recovery Act Changed Approach to Business, Laid Foundation for American Cities to Win the Future","WASHINGTON, DC - America's cities are better prepared to be sustainable economic engines according to a new report just released by the Department of Housing & Urban Development. The report titled The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act: Working for America's Cities found that the Recovery Act has helped position American cities to out-educate, out-innovate, and out-build our competitors. The collaborative and innovative approaches initiated during the implementation of the Recovery Act have laid the foundation for American cities to win the future.
Deputy Secretary Ron Sims released the report today with Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, D-MO, Chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, and Rep. Nydia M. Velázquez, D-NY, of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.
""As this data shows, the Recovery Act is rebuilding our communities by putting people back to work today, laying the foundation for long-term economic growth,"" said Deputy Secretary Sims. ""But it's also helping us win the future by changing the way government does business.""
The report found that the Recovery Act ushered in a new era in the way government approaches challenges, through partnerships between private enterprise and government agencies as well as more significant interagency collaboration. Initiatives made possible because of the historic investments of the Recovery Act have yielded lessons that will have long-term implications.
Key findings of the report include:
Sustainable Communities: Collaboration between the Department of Housing & Urban Development, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Department of Transportation (DOT) initiated new ways to give our cities a competitive advantage and solve multiple problems with a single investment. That led to the creation of a Sustainable Communities Initiativethat encourages links between residential centers to commercial, educational and corporate hubs through well-designed transit. Regions that embrace similar planning and approaches will be better prepared to attract jobs and private investment. Weatherization: HUD collaborated with DOE to coordinate the distribution of $5 billion in funds directed to weatherize homes and help American families reduce their energy costs. In the long-run through such investments, America will be less dependent on foreign oil and homeowners will have lower utility bills and more money to spend or save for retirement. Partnerships: Nationally, the Recovery Act directly stimulated $153 billion in private co-investment through matching grants, tax credits, loan guarantees, and direct loans. By the end of the Act's implementation, it is further projected that about $100 billion in Recovery Act funding will be matched by $280 billion in additional funds outside the federal government. This leverage in turn spurs production in various sectors of our economy, from the contractor who installed the technology to the manufacturer who built it to the truck driver who delivered it, having a tremendous short-term impact beyond federal funds alone. Homelessness Prevention: Innovative programs such as the Homelessness Prevention and Rapid Re-Housing (HPRP) are helping to change the way cities allocate resources and address problems. The impact of the Recovery Act in our cities will mean more efficient institutions that are making needed improvements to spur innovation and build foundations for winning the future. HPRP created a system that allowed individuals and families, facing life on the streets, to make specific payments that enabled them to cover their rent or move back into their homes. The report reveals that to date over 875,000 people - including 21,000 military veterans - were kept off the streets and in their homes because of this innovative program.

""The immediate impact of the Recovery pulled us back from the brink, saved jobs and reinforced cities,"" said Deputy Secretary Sims. ""The legacy of these initiatives will be cities that are prepared to facilitate sustainable growth and a system that will implement future change efficiently.""
Also, today, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack issued a report which shows that Recovery Act investments are renewing our Nation's rural areas and providing benefits to the 50 million people who live there. The report, The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act: Working for Rural Communities, shows Federal investments under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act) are helping rural communities in all 50 states and in territories extending from the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico to Guam."

03/17/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-031.cfm,"Charles Schwab Bank to Pay $30,000 to Settle Discrimination Complaint Involving Borrower with Disabilities","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today announced that Charles Schwab Bank has agreed to pay $30,000 settling allegations that the bank refused to accept a loan application from the adult son of a Metairie, Louisiana woman with disabilities. The son, who was acting with his mother's power of attorney, tried to apply for a loan on his mother's behalf, but was told that the bank did not accept powers of attorney for ""incapacitated borrowers.""
""Lenders must ensure that their policies take into account the needs of all borrowers and do not discriminate against persons with disabilities,"" said John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will continue to work with lenders to make sure that their policies and practices make lending opportunities available to everyone.""
The settlement follows a HUD investigation of a complaint against the San Francisco-based bank from a woman with disabilities who said the bank rebuffed her son's attempt to submit a loan application over the phone on her behalf. The son alleged the bank advised him that it does not accept power of attorney for ""incapacitated borrowers"" during the application process and refused to accept the loan information the son offered, despite the fact he had power of attorney for his mother. The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to have policies that discriminate or have a discriminatory effect against persons with disabilities.
According to the voluntary agreement in this case, Charles Schwab Bank agrees to: pay the borrower $25,000, $10,000 of which will go to St. Francis Xavier Church, as a charitable donation on behalf of the borrower; $5,000 to the borrower's son; permit persons with disabilities, where necessary, to use a power-of-attorney, at no additional cost; update the mortgage education section of its website to include questions and answers regarding powers-of-attorneys; and provide fair lending/fair housing training for its employees."
03/18/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-032.cfm,HUD Awards First Choice Neighborhood Grants,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Shaun Donovan announced today that 17 communities will be the first recipients of Planning Grant funding through the Department's new Choice Neighborhoods Initiative. These communities will share a total of $4 million in Choice Neighborhoods Planning Grants while six other communities are selected as finalists to compete for approximately $61 million in Choice Neighborhood Implementation Grants (see attached lists and project summaries here).
HUD's new Choice Neighborhoods Initiative (CN) will promote a comprehensive approach to transforming distressed areas of concentrated poverty into viable and sustainable mixed-income neighborhoods. Building on the successes of HUD's HOPE VI Program, Choice Neighborhoods will link housing improvements with a wider variety of public services including schools, public transit and employment opportunities.
""Today, we turn a new page in the way we tackle intergenerational poverty,"" said Donovan, in a White House announcement with U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan. ""President Obama has said that there is no greater economic policy than one that invests in our children's future and helps America out-educate the world. But that's not possible if we leave a whole generation of children behind in our poorest neighborhoods. The Choice Neighborhoods Initiative expands on the bipartisan success of the HOPE VI program by recognizing that we must link affordable housing with a mix of incomes and uses with quality education, public transportation, good jobs and safe streets.""
The Choice Neighborhoods Initiative is a centerpiece of the Obama Administration's interagency Neighborhood Revitalization Initiative - a collaboration between the Departments of Housing and Urban Development, Education, Justice, Treasury and Health and Human Services to support the ability of local leaders from the public and private sectors and attract the private investment needed to transform distressed neighborhoods into sustainable, mixed-income neighborhoods with the affordable housing, safe streets and good schools every family needs.
HUD received 119 submissions for CN Planning Grants and 42 submissions from communities seeking CN Implementation Grants. Successful Planning Grant applicants demonstrated their intent to transform neighborhoods by revitalizing severely distressed public and/or assisted housing while leveraging investments to create high-quality public schools, outstanding education and early learning programs, public assets, public transportation, and improved access to jobs and well-functioning services. HUD focused on directing resources to address three core goals - housing, people and neighborhoods.
The 17 communities awarded CN Planning Grants will use the funding to build the capacity they need to get them ready to undertake a successful neighborhood transformation to create a choice neighborhood. These grants will enable these communities create a comprehensive ""Transformation Plan,"" or road map, to transforming distressed public and/or assisted housing within a distressed community. This Federal support provides a significant incentive for the local community to take critical steps to create viable neighborhood transformation.
The six finalists for CN Implementation Grants have already undertaken the comprehensive local planning process and are ready to move forward with their Transformation Plan to redevelop their target neighborhoods. HUD will publish a second Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) shortly to give these finalists the opportunity to assemble and submit a more detailed application for the approximately $61 million in available funding. HUD will award these grants by the end of September.
Congress approved the Choice Neighborhoods Initiative with the passage of HUD's FY 2010 budget, allowing HUD to use $65 million in funding to provide competitive grants to assist in the transformation, rehabilitation and preservation of public housing and privately owned HUD-assisted housing. CN builds on the successes and lessons of HUD's HOPE VI program and widened the traditional pool of eligible applicants by allowing, in addition to public housing authorities, local governments, nonprofit organizations and for-profit developers (who apply jointly with a public entity) to apply."
03/18/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-033.cfm,CPSC and HUD Issue Updated Remediation Protocol for Homes with Problem Drywall,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) are issuing an updated remediation protocol for homes with problem drywall. A study conducted on behalf of CPSC by Sandia National Laboratories in New Mexico, finds no evidence of a safety hazard to home electrical systems. Sandia simulated long-term exposure of wiring and other electrical components to hydrogen sulfide gas, which is associated with problem drywall.
Based on this study, CPSC and HUD staff, representing the Interagency Task Force on Problem Drywall, are no longer recommending the removal of all electrical wiring in homes with problem drywall. This change in the government's protocol may reduce the cost of remediation for many homes.
After simulating more than 40 years of corrosive conditions that could exist in problem drywall homes, Sandia staff did not observe any acute or long-term electrical safety events, such as smoking or fire. Corrosion and blackening of the exposed electrical components did occur and was observed to be consistent with the characteristic corrosion reported to CPSC by thousands of consumers. Based on this study, it is the belief of the staffs of CPSC, HUD and Sandia that long-term exposure of wiring and other electrical components to hydrogen sulfide gases does not indicate a safety hazard to a home's electrical systems.
With these changes, the remediation guidance for homes with problem drywall calls for the replacement of all:
problem drywall; fire safety alarm devices, including smoke and carbon monoxide alarms; electrical distribution components, including receptacles, switches and circuit breakers; and gas service piping and fire suppression sprinkler systems.
• problem drywall;
• fire safety alarm devices, including smoke and carbon monoxide alarms;
• electrical distribution components, including receptacles, switches and circuit breakers; and
• gas service piping and fire suppression sprinkler systems.
CPSC and HUD staffs are also issuing an updated identification guidance, which broadens the range of installation years of affected homes to include homes where drywall was installed as late as 2009. Importantly, the drywall installed in 2009 had been previously imported during the years 2006-2007 and does not represent any new importation of problem drywall.
The staffs of CPSC and HUD believe that following the updated identification and remediation protocols will enable homeowners to correctly identify homes containing problem drywall and comprehensively remediate those homes to address any potential health and safety issues associated with the problem drywall.
CPSC is in the final stages of completing its scientific investigation into problem drywall. For additional findings from the Interagency Drywall Task Force's investigation, visit www.DrywallResponse.gov."
03/24/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-034.cfm,HUD Issues Report on Number of Very Low-Income Renters with Disabilities Who Experienced 'Worst Case Housing Needs',"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today issued a report summarizing efforts to the measure the extent of ""worst case housing needs"" among very low-income renter households with disabilities. HUD's 2009 Worst Case Housing Needs of People with Disabilities (www.huduser.org/portal/publications/affhsg/wcn_disability.html) finds that approximately 1 million households that included nonelderly people with disabilities had worst case needs.
""Worst case housing needs"" are defined as very low-income renters (incomes below half the median in their area) who do not receive government housing assistance and who either paid more than half their monthly incomes for rent, lived in severely substandard conditions, or both.
""This is the first time we've been able to use a direct measure to estimate the number of these households rather than relying on proxies,"" said Dr. Raphael Bostic, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research. ""Better data will help inform us on how best to house and serve this vulnerable population. Persons with disabilities are confronted with a number of obstacles to finding decent rental housing, including discrimination and the general lack of accessible housing they can afford.""
Last month, HUD issued its latest in a long-running series of reports on the extent of worst case housing needs. Based on data from HUD's American Housing Survey (AHS) conducted between May and September of 2009, the full report found a stark increase in the overall number of worst case housing needs between 2007 and 2009. This study is a supplement to that report and presents national estimates and information on the critical housing problems that confront low-income renting families that include people with disabilities.
In 2009, the AHS included for the first time, direct questions on disability, presenting a unique opportunity to improve the estimates of the number of households that include people with disabilities who experience worst case needs. Until 2008, HUD identified households that include people with disabilities by using a proxy measure of several reported income sources that are typically associated with disabilities. Although the proxy measure improved significantly over the years as a result of better AHS data and methods, it has acknowledged limitations, such as undercounting people with disabilities, in some cases, and flagging people who do not report disabilities, in other cases.
Trends in Worst Case Needs and Disabilities between 2005 and 2009
Using HUD's former proxy measure is the only method to examine any change from prior year reports in the number of these very-low income households with disabilities. In 2009, the number and prevalence of worst case needs increased among very low-income renters with disabilities. Because a direct measure was not available before the 2009 AHS, changes overtime have to rely on income proxy measure. According to income proxy measure, the number of worst case needs households with disabilities increased by 140,000 between 2007 and 2009, affecting 1.1 million households.
Major findings of the study include:
In 2009, 2.6 million very low-income renter households included nonelderly people reporting at least one of the six measures of disabilities (visual, hearing, cognitive, ambulatory, self-care, and independent living limitations) and, of those, 987,000 experienced worst case needs, which put the prevalence of worst case needs at 38 percent among this group. Ambulatory, cognitive, and independent living limitations were the most prevalent limitations among households with worst case needs and with people with disabilities. Visual, hearing, and self-care limitations were found in a smaller share of those same households. In the households that included nonelderly people with disabilities, 86 percent included nonelderly adults with disabilities, 18 percent included children with disabilities, and 4 percent included both instances. Renter households that include nonelderly people with disabilities are more likely than those that don't include people with disabilities to have very low incomes, experience worst case needs, pay more than one-half of their income for rents, and have other housing problems, such as living in inadequate or overcrowded housing. On the positive side, renter households that include nonelderly people with disabilities are two times more likely to receive housing assistance than those that don't include people with disabilities. According to the income proxy measure, between 2007 and 2009, the number of worst case needs households that included people with disabilities increased by 100,000, reaching 1.1 million households. In this time period, the prevalence of worst case needs among very low-income renters with disabilities increased from 38 to 41 percent.

03/24/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-035.cfm,"HUD Awards Nearly $54 Million to Help Low-Income Families Receive Job Training, Employment","WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan announced today that public housing agencies across the United States will receive nearly $54 million to link low-income families with the necessary education and job training to put them on the path to self-sufficiency. See local funding here.
Funded through HUD's Housing Choice Voucher Family Self-Sufficiency Program (HCV/FSS), the grants allow public housing agencies (PHAs) to work with welfare agencies, schools, businesses, and other local partners to develop a comprehensive program to help individuals already participating in HUD's Housing Choice Voucher Program increase their education or gain marketable skills that will enable them to obtain jobs that pay a living wage.
""This program is absolutely critical in today's economy,"" said Donovan. ""The research demonstrates that this program works. When families are given the tools they need to move beyond the voucher program, they do. Ultimately, they become self-sufficient and more vouchers become available for other families, some who have been waiting for long periods to receive housing assistance. For America to win the future we need a trained and skilled workforce.""
The funding allows local housing authorities to hire coordinators (or caseworkers) to link adults in the Housing Choice Voucher program to local organizations that provide job training, childcare, counseling, transportation and job placement.
Participants in the HCV/FSS program sign a contract that requires the head of the household to get a job and the family will no longer receive welfare assistance at the end of the five-year term. As the family's income rises, a portion of that increased income is deposited in an interest-bearing escrow account. If the family completes its FSS contract, the family receives the escrow funds that it can use for any purpose, including paying educational expenses, starting a business or paying back debts.
The Family Self Sufficiency (FSS) Program is a long-standing resource for increasing economic security and self-sufficiency among HCV participants. A new report just issued by HUD (www.huduser.org/portal/publications/affhsg/eval_fssp.html) evaluated the effectiveness of the FSS Program. Conducted from 2005 to 2009, HUD's study shows the financial benefits are substantial for participants who remain and complete the program. This study is the second of a three-part series by HUD that evaluate the effects of the FSS program. The first study (www.huduser.org/portal/publications/econdev/selfsufficiency.html) in the series found individuals who participated in the FSS program fared better financially than those who did not enroll in the program. HUD's Office of Policy Development and Research (PD&R) will launch the third and final installment to complete this series this year.
PD&R will also launch two additional studies this year about the FSS program. The first study will examine whether FSS participants who were still enrolled when the Prospective Study ended went on to graduate from the FSS program and whether they met their goals for financial self-sufficiency. The second will study the effectiveness of the FSS program nationally. This will be the first national study of the FSS program as part of HUD's Transformation Initiative, which was created in 2010 to encourage more transparency and accountability within the agency."
03/24/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-036.cfm,"HUD Makes Available $61 Million to Six Applicants to Provide Quality Affordable Housing, Revitalize Neighborhoods","WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development posted a Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) today for the six entities that were last week named finalists to receive the first Implementation Grant funding through HUD's new Choice Neighborhoods Initiative (CN).
On Friday, HUD announced that the entities listed below would compete for the $61 million in available funding that will be used to transform distressed areas of concentrated poverty into viable and sustainable mixed-income neighborhoods. (See grant summaries here).
""There are many communities across the country that desperately want - and deserve - an opportunity to transform some of their most distressed neighborhoods into areas of opportunity and hope,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""These finalists submitted transformation plans for these neighborhoods that will tackle intergenerational poverty and address not just public and affordable housing, but the education, transportation and employment challenges that so often surround that housing. President Obama has said that there is no greater economic policy than one that invests in our children's future and helps America out-educate the world. But that's simply not possible if we leave a whole generation of children behind in our poorest neighborhoods.""
The entities successfully completed a streamlined Round 1 Choice Neighborhoods grant application to be named finalists. They have already undertaken the comprehensive local planning process and are ready to move forward with their Transformation Plan to transform their distressed neighborhoods. This Choice Neighborhoods Round 2 Implementation Grants NOFA will give these finalists the opportunity to assemble and submit a more detailed application that could garner them up to $30.5 million to develop a ""choice neighborhood."" HUD anticipates awarding two to four grants by the end of September 2011.
These finalists will be ranked and rated on how well their vision addresses Choice Neighborhoods' three core goals:
Housing: Transform distressed public and assisted housing into energy efficient, mixed-income housing that is physically and financially viable over the long-term; People: Support positive outcomes for families who live in the distressed and soon to be transformed development(s) and the surrounding neighborhood, particularly outcomes related to residents' health, safety, employment, mobility, and education; and Neighborhood: Transform neighborhoods of poverty into viable, mixed-income neighborhoods with access to well-functioning services, high quality public schools and education programs, high quality early learning programs and services, public assets, public transportation, and improved access to jobs.
• Housing: Transform distressed public and assisted housing into energy efficient, mixed-income housing that is physically and financially viable over the long-term;
• People: Support positive outcomes for families who live in the distressed and soon to be transformed development(s) and the surrounding neighborhood, particularly outcomes related to residents' health, safety, employment, mobility, and education; and
• Neighborhood: Transform neighborhoods of poverty into viable, mixed-income neighborhoods with access to well-functioning services, high quality public schools and education programs, high quality early learning programs and services, public assets, public transportation, and improved access to jobs.
Within these broad categories are simple but significant actions to ensure that future generations will not be left behind academically or economically. For example, as part of their Transformation Plans, finalists were required to develop a comprehensive education strategy to ensure that neighborhood residents between the ages of 0-18 will have access to high-quality early learning programs, schools, and education programs. They were also required to include broadband infrastructure for Internet access in all new housing that will allow more frequent Internet usage, which provides greater access to employment information, as well as health, education, financial and other services. The new NOFA grants higher scores for high-quality design and green building - encouraging communities that are not just visually attractive, but more functional and energy efficient for neighborhood residents.
The Choice Neighborhoods Initiative is a centerpiece of the Obama Administration's interagency Neighborhood Revitalization Initiative - a collaboration between the Departments of Housing and Urban Development, Education, Justice, Treasury and Health and Human Services to support the ability of local leaders from the public and private sectors and attract the private investment needed to transform distressed neighborhoods into sustainable, mixed-income neighborhoods with the affordable housing, safe streets and good schools every family needs.

03/25/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-037.cfm,HUD Approves $66 Million Deal for Chicago Medical Center,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced a commitment to insure a mortgage loan to Mercy Hospital and Medical Center in Chicago, Illinois. The $66 million loan is made possible through the Federal Housing Administration's (FHA) Section 242 Hospital Mortgage Insurance Program.
The FHA-insured mortgage loan includes $24 million in construction costs to renovate a birthing center, improve a 10-bed Cardiac Care Unit, provide for hospital-wide installation of sprinklers and a fire alarm system, and update the facility's air handing system. The loan will also be used to refinance 2005 bridge loans.
""FHA-insured financing is helping hospitals improve their service and manage their debt,"" said HUD Deputy Secretary Ron Sims. ""By helping to make these projects possible, FHA also contributes to the financial well-being of communities by creating jobs to stimulate local economies.""
HUD estimates that the Mercy Hospital and Medical Center construction project will support 277 full-time jobs and provide an estimated economic stimulus of $85 million to the community. HUD's estimates are based on results from an economic model used by public and private institutions to examine a variety of economic development issues.
By insuring the mortgage loan, FHA is enabling the hospital to obtain a low-cost financing that will save an estimated $22.9 million in interest expense over the life of the loan. Since 1968, FHA has insured 396 mortgage loans totaling $17 billion to hospitals in 43 states and Puerto Rico. The Section 242 program serves the full spectrum of acute care hospitals, including small rural hospitals, inner-city hospitals, and large academic medical centers."
03/25/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-038.cfm,HUD Awards $4.2 Million in HIV/AIDS Housing Grants to Four Local Programs,"WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development awarded $4.2 million to four local permanent supportive housing grants that offer critically needed housing and support services to extremely low-income persons living with HIV/AIDS. These grants will help 335 households with permanent supportive housing support and 499 households with needed supportive services over the next three years as they address the challenges of finding a stable home and receiving care to manage their illness. The funding announced today is offered through HUD's Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) Program and will renew support of four projects in Georgia, Illinois, New Mexico and Wisconsin (see attached project descriptions).
""At HUD, we recognize the profound affects that housing can have on the lives and livelihoods of people living with HIV/AIDS,"" said Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""Working closely with our local partners, we can offer those individuals and families the security of having a roof over their heads.""
Housing assistance and related services funded by HOPWA are a vital part of the comprehensive system of care for those living with HIV/AIDS. A stable home environment is critical for low-income persons managing complex drug therapies, allowing them to access this support and maintain such care in a consistent and effective manner.
Ninety percent of HOPWA funds are distributed by formula to cities and states based on the number of AIDS cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. HUD's formula grants are managed by 121 local and state jurisdictions, which coordinate AIDS housing efforts with other HUD and community resources.
The Obama administration is committed to re-focusing public attention on the domestic HIV/AIDS epidemic. One of the administration's top HIV/AIDS priorities is the development and implementation of a National AIDS Strategy (NHAS). The three primary goals for the NHAS are to: reduce HIV incidence, increase access to health care and optimize health outcomes, and reduce HIV-related health disparities. In February 2011, HUD released its operational plan to guide the agency's actions under the NHAS. As the nation's housing agency, HUD will contribute through actions to maximize the effective use of housing resources and promote better integration of housing interventions into comprehensive HIV care systems."

03/29/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-041.cfm,"HUD Assumes Control of Lafayette, Louisiana Housing Authority","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that, effectively immediately, it is taking control of the Housing Authority of the City of Lafayette (HACL), citing numerous financial deficiencies over the past three years and a leadership vacuum following the resignation of the agency's executive director last October.
In a letter to the Lafayette City-Parish President Joseph Durel, HUD says the agency violated federal law and defaulted on its Public Housing Annual Contributions Contract (ACC) - the agreement that local housing authorities enter into with the federal government to administer HUD's public housing programs.
""Good management is the cornerstone of running an effective organization,"" said HUD Assistant Secretary Sandra B. Henriquez. ""The Lafayette Housing Authority currently lacks an executive director and an effective Board of Commissioners. This leaves HUD with no other choice but to assume control of its operations. We have an obligation to protect both the taxpayer and the residents who rely on the agency's services.""
Henriquez named Daniel Rodriguez Jr., who has been with HUD for 23 years, as the administrative receiver to manage HACL's day-to-day operations. Rodriguez currently works in the public housing program at HUD's Houston Field Office. He was selected last October to assist with HACL's operations, which included reviewing records, paying bills and providing guidance to staff after the HACL's executive director resigned suddenly.
Rodriguez has acquired tremendous knowledge of public housing oversight over his years at HUD because of similar appointments. He was interim executive director of the Beaumont Housing Authority for nine months before being named chairman of the Board of Commissioners of the Beaumont Housing Authority when HUD took over the housing authority in 2001. He also served briefly as the HUD-appointed Board Chairman of the Orange County (Texas) Housing during a receivership period before the agency was dissolved. From 1997 through 2001, Rodriguez was the deputy executive director for the Houston Housing Authority. He has a bachelor's degree in business administration in accounting from the University of Texas at Pan-American.
Henriquez also named Ada Holloway, the director for the Office of Public and Indian Housing at HUD's Atlanta Regional Office, as the one-person board. She will provide oversight and ensure rules, regulations and agreements undertaken by the housing authority are in line with the housing authority's mission. Holloway has more than 20 years of affordable housing experience, including nine years at HUD. She has a master's degree in Urban Affairs and Public Policy from the University of Delaware and a bachelor's degree in Sociology from Hampton (Va.) University.
Henriquez added, ""Dan is uniquely suited to hit the ground running. For months now, he's been helping to resolve some of the short term problems plaguing this housing authority. He's fully aware of the challenges of getting this housing authority to where it needs to be. In addition, Ada brings the expertise we need in Lafayette at this time.""
HUD requires that all housing agencies conduct an annual audit its financial operations by an independent public auditor. Between 2007 and 2009, HACL's independent auditing firm cited numerous negative findings of HACL's operations. Despite HACL awareness of these serious findings, it failed to address them. The major findings cited by HUD in the default letter are:
HACL has Weak Accounting Controls - In fiscal year 2009, the independent auditor determined that HACL failed to maintain good internal controls. Failure to maintain proper internal controls could result in fraud, waste and abuse of HUD funds. Specifically, in 2009, the auditor tested travel expenses, credit card statements, vendor files, check disbursements, bank reconciliations, general ledger transactions, vendor payments, accounts payable, employees' salaries, and compliance with state requirements and determined that deficiencies existed in each area. Most of these deficiencies were identified previously in audits for fiscal years 2007 and 2008. HACL misused HUD and state funds on non-ACC projects - The independent auditor found that in FY 2009, HACL improperly used $91,000 of HUD funds to pay for the development of a non-ACC project, which is a violation of the contract. The auditor also found that HACL violated a state cooperative endeavor agreement by improperly using state grant funds intended to develop buildings to withstand hurricane force winds. HACL improperly used these funds to pay for the development of the same project that HACL improperly used HUD funds to subsidize. HACL lacks effective leadership - In the three years of negative audits, the Executive Director of HACL did not adopt corrective measures to address these problems, and the Board of Commissioners did not demand action to do so even after repeated HUD attempts to stabilize the agency.

Through the DDRG team's investigation, this month's Cityscape provides a snapshot of homelessness in America and represents outstanding HUD-sponsored research, including:
Courtney Cronley of Rutgers University explores the use of management information systems by homeless service providers finding those providers surveyed showed high levels of organizational resistance to technological change. Thus, educating local leadership about the utility and ease of use of new technologies, such as an information management system, is challenging although it is critical and essential to the success of national programs. George Carter of the U.S. Census Bureau examined the overrepresentation of African Americans in the homeless population, which represents 13 percent of the U.S. population but account for approximately 40 percent of the homeless persons. Carter found that overall metropolitan area housing segregation is linked to higher levels of black homelessness as well as the clustering of services available to homeless people at the urban core, where there is often a large minority population. Tatjana Meschede of Brandeis University studied the achievements and failures of services attempting to reach those most likely to be left out of the homeless service delivery model—the chronically homeless street population. Meschede's study investigates the bridges and barriers to housing for 174 chronically homeless street dwellers in urban Boston and examines whether the services provided by public shelters, healthcare professionals, detoxification centers, and substance-abuse programs actually help homeless individuals move off the street and into permanent housing. Although providers typically worked to address other needs of the homeless clients, the clients themselves were much more focused on housing. Meschede's work led her to conclude that ""access to services and benefits alone cannot solve the homeless crisis. The long-term goal of ending chronic homelessness can only be achieved with sufficient resources to address the housing needs of this population, in addition to their service needs. As such, no services to the chronically homeless street population should be delivered without the focus on permanent housing.""

This month's guest editor Susan Brunson, writes that ""The process of discovery that results from talented new scholars armed with the tools of their respective disciplines may help this country make progress against (homelessness).""
Beginning with this issue, Cityscape will also present brief reactions to the Symposium articles from distinguished foreign scholars who have examined similar issues in their own countries. Suzanne Fitzpatrick of Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, Scotland, and Julie Christian of the University of Birmingham in the United Kingdom pointed to groundbreaking European analyses of housing and social inclusion.

03/31/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-048.cfm,HUD Selects Two Innovative Public Housing Authorities to Elite Program to Enhance Federal Rental Assistance Programs,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development Assistant Secretary Sandra B. Henriquez announced today that two public housing agencies - Boulder Housing Partners in Colorado and Lexington-Fayette Urban County in Kentucky - have been selected to participate in HUD's Moving To Work Program (MTW). This program allows housing agencies to design and test innovative strategies to strengthen the delivery of services to families living in public housing or who are assisted through HUD's Housing Choice Voucher Program.
The two agencies will join 33 others across the U.S. that participate in the MTW Program. The agencies were selected from five agencies that applied for MTW designation last year and will have this designation until 2018 (see attached summaries).
""These agencies have a long history of implementing novel programs and forming successful partnerships that have improved the quality of life for families who need HUD's assisted housing programs,"" said Henriquez. ""As MTW agencies, they will have more flexibility to build upon their success to use effectively scarce public dollars to maintain quality affordable housing that meets local needs.""
The MTW program was created in 1996 as a demonstration or ""test project"" to give housing authorities the opportunity to design and test innovative, locally developed housing and self-sufficiency strategies for low-income families participating in HUD's public housing and Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) programs. HUD waives certain reporting requirements and permits these agencies to combine multiple sources of HUD funding into a single agency-wide funding source. MTW agencies also get considerable flexibility in determining how to use their HUD funding. These agencies are, however, required to serve substantially the same number and type of households as they would without MTW designation. The program aims to accomplish three goals:
Reduce costs and achieve greater cost effectiveness in federal expenditures; Give incentives to families with children where the head of household is working, is seeking work, or is preparing for work by participating in job training, educational programs, or programs that assist people to obtain employment and become economically self-sufficient; and Increase housing choices for low-income families.
• Reduce costs and achieve greater cost effectiveness in federal expenditures;
• Give incentives to families with children where the head of household is working, is seeking work, or is preparing for work by participating in job training, educational programs, or programs that assist people to obtain employment and become economically self-sufficient; and
• Increase housing choices for low-income families."
03/31/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-049.cfm,Agencies Seek Comment on Risk Retention Proposal,"WASHINGTON - Six federal agencies are seeking comment on a proposed rule that would require sponsors of asset-backed securities (ABS) to retain at least 5 percent of the credit risk of the assets underlying the securities and would not permit sponsors to transfer or hedge that credit risk. In crafting the proposed rule, the agencies sought to ensure that the amount of credit risk retained is meaningful, while reducing the potential for the rule to negatively affect the availability and cost of credit to consumers and businesses.
The rule is proposed by the Federal Reserve Board, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. It would provide sponsors with various options for meeting the risk-retention requirements of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Among other things, the options include:
retention of risk by holding at least 5 percent of each class of ABS issued in a securitization transaction (also known as vertical retention); retention of a first-loss residual interest in an amount equal to at least 5 percent of the par value of all ABS interests issued in a securitization transaction (horizontal retention); an equally-divided combination of vertical and horizontal retention; retention of a representative sample of the assets designated for securitization in an amount equal to at least 5 percent of the unpaid principal balance of all the designated assets; and for commercial mortgage-backed securities, retention of at least a 5 percent first-loss residual interest by a third party that specifically negotiates for the interest, if certain requirements are met.
• retention of risk by holding at least 5 percent of each class of ABS issued in a securitization transaction (also known as vertical retention);
• retention of a first-loss residual interest in an amount equal to at least 5 percent of the par value of all ABS interests issued in a securitization transaction (horizontal retention);
• an equally-divided combination of vertical and horizontal retention;
• retention of a representative sample of the assets designated for securitization in an amount equal to at least 5 percent of the unpaid principal balance of all the designated assets; and
• for commercial mortgage-backed securities, retention of at least a 5 percent first-loss residual interest by a third party that specifically negotiates for the interest, if certain requirements are met.
As required by the act, the proposal includes descriptions of loans that would not be subject to these requirements, including asset-backed securities that are collateralized exclusively by residential mortgages that qualify as “qualified residential mortgages” (QRMs). The proposal would establish a definition for QRMs--incorporating such criteria as borrower credit history, payment terms, and loan-to-value ratio--designed to ensure they are of very high credit quality. The proposed rule also includes investor disclosure requirements regarding material information concerning the sponsor's retained interests in a securitization transaction. The disclosures would provide investors and the agencies with an efficient mechanism to monitor compliance with the risk-retention requirements of the proposed rules.
The proposed rule also has a zero percent risk-retention requirement for ABS collateralized exclusively by commercial loans, commercial mortgages, or automobile loans that meet certain underwriting standards. As with QRMs, these underwriting standards are designed to be robust and to ensure that the loans backing the ABS are of very low credit risk.
The proposed rule would also recognize that the 100 percent guarantee of principal and interest provided by Fannie Mae (the Federal National Mortgage Association) and Freddie Mac (the Federal Home Mortgage Loan Corporation) meets their risk-retention requirements as sponsors of mortgage-backed securities for as long as they are in conservatorship or receivership with capital support from the U.S. government.
Public comments on the proposed rule are due by June 10, 2011.
Read the proposed rule announced today."
04/01/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//local/ct/news/pr2011-04-01.cfm,HUD Approves Connecticut's $33 Million Emergency Home Loan Program,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Shaun Donovan today approved the State of Connecticut's bid to administer HUD's Emergency Homeowner Loan Program (EHLP), a bridge loan program designed to help unemployed families pay their mortgages. HUD determined Connecticut's Housing Finance Authority's mortgage bridge loan program is ""substantially similar"" to HUD's program, thereby allowing the State to begin implementing the program itself.
Late last year, HUD awarded $1 billion to 32 states and Puerto Rico, including $33 million to the State of Connecticut, to provide emergency assistance to homeowners at risk of foreclosure due to a substantial reduction in income brought on by layoff, underemployment, or a medical condition. With today's approval, Connecticut is expected to begin accepting applications from distressed homeowners in early April.
""The Emergency Homeowner Loan Program will provide limited and targeted assistance to help working families get back on their feet and keep their home while they look for work,"" said Secretary Donovan. ""We are pleased to get the program off the ground in Connecticut, which is already working to help keep families in their homes during difficult economic times.""
""While our economy is showing signs of improvement, it's unfortunately not fast enough for some families who are struggling to keep their houses in these tough economic times,"" said Governor Dannel Malloy. ""While this is a federal program, it will be implemented right here in Connecticut, allowing families who need our help the most to receive it efficiently and quickly.""
""This HUD grant will enable more struggling families to stay in their homes - good news for them and Connecticut's economy,"" U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal said. ""I'll continue working for our state's hard-pressed homeowners who still need help.""
""This emergency funding will go a long way to help unemployed homeowners in our community keep their homes while they continue to search for work,"" said Congressman John Larson. ""That's exactly why we created this program, and I'm glad it's delivering for Connecticut families.""
""In these tough economic times, assistance such as the Emergency Homeowners Loan Program (EHLP) will play a critical role for individuals and families that have seen drastic cuts to their income, are unable to find a job, or have significant medical problems,"" Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro said. ""These funds will enable many Connecticut residents to get back on their feet financially and hold onto their homes.""
EHLP was created by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The law authorized HUD's Secretary to allow funds to be administered by states that have an existing program that provides substantially similar assistance to homeowners. HUD found Pennsylvania is administering an equivalent program and the grant funds may be used for reasonable administrative costs and to provide EHLP loans to homeowners in the state.
HUD's Emergency Home Loan Program will work through a variety of state and non-profit entities and will offer a declining balance, deferred payment ""bridge loan"" (zero percent interest, non-recourse, subordinate loan) for up to $50,000 to assist eligible borrowers with payments on their mortgage principal, interest, mortgage insurance, taxes and hazard insurance for up to 24 months.
Under the program, eligible borrowers must:
• Be at least three months delinquent in their payments and have a reasonable likelihood of being able to resume repayment of their mortgage payments and related housing expenses within two years;
• Have a mortgage property that is the principal residence of the borrower; and
• Demonstrate a good payment record prior to the event that produced the reduction of income.
HUD determined that 27 states will use the delegated approach to program administration. Under this approach, HUD will delegate key program administration functions to an experienced and highly regarded national network of affiliated housing counseling agencies. Under the program, nonprofit housing counselors who are part of the National Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling Program administered by NeighborWorks® America will coordinate intake counseling, document preparation and outreach functions. HUD will also use it delegation authority to contract with an experienced entity to provide loan servicing and fiscal control functions such as collecting payments from homeowners, distributing payments to servicers, and managing loan balances.
HUD will announce additional details and program specifics for the delegated approach states when NeighborWorks® America launches the program in the coming weeks."

""Today's announcement means scores of hard-working Delaware families who have been hardest hit by the recession will have another option to avoid foreclosure,"" U.S. Senator Thomas Carper said. ""HUD's Emergency Homeowner Loan Program helps unemployed Delawareans keep a roof over their family's heads, while looking for full-time employment during one of the worst economic downturns in decades. In addition to helping the recovery of our housing market, these funds will help those families most in need, and make sure that families who played by the rules and pay their bill on time can avoid foreclosure.""

04/01/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-050.cfm,Obama Administration Releases March Housing Scorecard,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of the Treasury today released the March edition of the Obama Administration's Housing Scorecard. Officials caution that the latest housing figures underscore fragility in the housing market and the need to continue efforts to help American families stay in their homes. The housing scorecard is a comprehensive report on the nation's housing market.
""There's no question that this month's figures show a troubling dip in home sales and housing prices,"" said HUD Assistant Secretary Raphael Bostic. ""While we should not ignore the real impact that the Obama Administration's programs are having for millions of homeowners and borrowers, these statistics clearly show that housing markets across the country continue to struggle to regain stable footing. We must remain steadfast in our efforts to support homeowners and communities in ways to help advance market stabilization and a transition towards health.""
""The latest data underscore the importance of continuing our efforts to help families stay in their homes,"" said acting Assistant Secretary for Financial Stability Tim Massad. ""Each month, the Administration's Home Affordable Modification Program helps over 25,000 additional families avoid foreclosure, and it has set important standards that have led to more than 2 million mortgage modifications outside of the program. We are also working hard to implement additional programs to assist families in the hardest-hit states. We will continue these efforts so that we help more Americans remain in their homes and help our nation recover from this crisis.""
Available online at www.hud.gov/scorecard, the March Housing Scorecard features key data on the health of the housing market including:
Housing market remains fragile as data through February paint a mixed picture of recovery. Home prices remain weak under continued strain from foreclosures and distressed home sales, according to CoreLogic data now available in the Housing Scorecard. Mortgage delinquencies continued a downward trend compared to early 2010 and foreclosure starts and completions remain below peak. However, as lenders review internal procedures related to foreclosure processing, many foreclosure actions have been delayed. The decline is likely to be temporary as lenders eventually revise and resubmit foreclosure paperwork in the coming months. Administration efforts have helped millions of families deal with the effects of the deepest economic crisis since the Great Depression. Since April of 2009, record low mortgage rates have helped nearly 10 million homeowners to refinance, resulting in $18.1 billion in total borrower savings. More than 4.4 million modification arrangements were started between April 2009 and the end of February 2011 - including more than 1.5 million HAMP trial modification starts, more than 776,000 FHA loss mitigation and early delinquency interventions, and nearly 2.2 million proprietary modifications under HOPE Now. While some homeowners may have received help from more than one program, the number of agreements offered was more than double the number of foreclosure completions for the same period (1.9 million).

• Housing market remains fragile as data through February paint a mixed picture of recovery. Home prices remain weak under continued strain from foreclosures and distressed home sales, according to CoreLogic data now available in the Housing Scorecard. Mortgage delinquencies continued a downward trend compared to early 2010 and foreclosure starts and completions remain below peak. However, as lenders review internal procedures related to foreclosure processing, many foreclosure actions have been delayed. The decline is likely to be temporary as lenders eventually revise and resubmit foreclosure paperwork in the coming months.
• Administration efforts have helped millions of families deal with the effects of the deepest economic crisis since the Great Depression. Since April of 2009, record low mortgage rates have helped nearly 10 million homeowners to refinance, resulting in $18.1 billion in total borrower savings. More than 4.4 million modification arrangements were started between April 2009 and the end of February 2011 - including more than 1.5 million HAMP trial modification starts, more than 776,000 FHA loss mitigation and early delinquency interventions, and nearly 2.2 million proprietary modifications under HOPE Now. While some homeowners may have received help from more than one program, the number of agreements offered was more than double the number of foreclosure completions for the same period (1.9 million). View the February HAMP Servicer Performance Report (www.treasury.gov/initiatives/financial-stability/results/MHA-Reports/Pages/default.aspx).
Given the current fragility and recognizing that recovery will take place over time, the Administration remains committed to its efforts to prevent avoidable foreclosures and stabilize the housing market.
Each month, the Housing Scorecard incorporates key housing market indicators and highlights the impact of the Administration's unprecedented housing recovery efforts, including assistance to homeowners through the FHA and HAMP.

04/05/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-052.cfm,"HUD Kicks Off Fair Housing Month, Launches National Media Campaign","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced today that it is launching a national media campaign to kick off Fair Housing Month, celebrated across the country each April to commemorate the passage of the Fair Housing Act. The ""Live Free"" campaign will use newspaper and magazine ads, as well as the latest digital media, including social networking sites, to increase the Department's efforts to educate the public and housing providers about their fair housing rights and responsibilities.
""Much has changed since the Fair Housing Act became law in 1968. Our country is more diverse than it's ever been. These changes have brought new challenges as we continue our fight to address inequality in housing,"" said John Trasvina, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Our society is more technologically advanced today. Therefore, this new campaign uses the latest media tools to better reach all people about housing discrimination and what to do if they experience it.""
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to discriminate in housing transactions based on race, color, national origin, religion, gender, disability, or family status.
HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity (FHEO) will introduce the campaign and discuss current and future enforcement initiatives during the Department's Fair Housing Month opening program, which will take place at HUD headquarters, 451 7th Street SW, Washington, DC, from 2 p.m. to 3 p.m., Tuesday, April 5, inside the Brooke-Mondale Auditorium. The keynote speaker for the program will be U.S. Representative Frederica Wilson, who will be joined by HUD Deputy Secretary Ron Sims, FHEO Assistant Secretary Trasviña, HUD senior managers and fair housing advocates from throughout the region.
The ""Live Free"" campaign will run throughout the year and include Facebook ads, targeted print ads, digital videos, and podcasts that draw attention to the different types of discrimination HUD and its partner agencies see today, including discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals.
One case HUD handled and settled this past year involved a disabled Louisiana woman who couldn't get a home loan because the bank wouldn't allow her son, who was acting with her power of attorney, to complete the paperwork. In another recent HUD case, First National Bank of St. Louis agreed to invest more than $2.5 million in two Missouri counties and one Illinois county after the bank failed to provide services in African American neighborhoods. Examples of other HUD cases include a Wisconsin family that was denied the opportunity to view an apartment because they have children, and a New Hampshire woman who was discriminated against and insulted by her landlord because she is married to a Hispanic man.
These types of cases dramatize today's fair housing challenges and highlight the importance of the Department's enforcement efforts. HUD recently awarded $40.8 million to 108 fair housing organizations and non-profit agencies to address housing discrimination, including mortgage rescue scams.
For more information about the Fair Housing Act, including summaries of recent housing discrimination cases, go to www.hud.gov/fairhousing.
FHEO and its partners in the Fair Housing Assistance Program investigate more than 10,000 housing discrimination complaints annually. People who believe they are the victims of housing discrimination should contact HUD at 1-800-669-9777 (voice), 800-927-9275 (TTY)."
04/08/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-053.cfm,"HUD's Fair Housing Campaign to Focus on Ensuring Equal Access for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Persons","WASHINGTON - The Department of Housing and Urban Development has launched a new media campaign, ""Live Free,"" that will, among other things, strive to ensure that people have equal access to housing regardless of sexual orientation and gender identity.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing discriminate based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, disability, or families with children. While sexual orientation and gender identity are not prohibited bases of discrimination under the federal Fair Housing Act, housing discrimination against someone who is LGBT may, in certain circumstances, violate the Act's existing provisions, including its prohibition against gender discrimination.
""While 20 states and over 200 local governments have led the way to make LGBT-related housing discrimination illegal, HUD is firmly committed to supporting the right of LGBT individuals and families to lead productive and dignified lives, free from housing discrimination and fear of retaliation,"" said John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD is finalizing a federal rule to ensure that HUD housing and programs are open to all, irrespective of marital status, gender identify, and sexual orientation.""
The ""Live Free"" print advertisements are focused to particular targeted audiences. For example, one print ad reads ""Should Gender Stereotypes Influence Where Your live? Learn More."" ""Live Free"" campaign will run throughout the year and include Facebook ads, targeted print ads, digital videos, and podcasts.
In 2010, HUD provided Guidance to its staff on how to more effectively address inquiries from LGBT individuals regarding housing discrimination issues and also launched a webpage for the public on LGBT housing discrimination. Since then, HUD's housing discrimination complaint level from LGBT individuals has increased significantly. From July 1, 2010 to February 28, 2011, LGBT individuals filed 47 complaints of housing discrimination alleging gender discrimination with HUD. During the same period straddling 2009 and 2010 prior to issuance of the guidance, HUD only received 3 such complaints.

04/08/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-054.cfm,FHA's Mortgagee Review Board Announces Settlement with First American Mortgage Trust,"WASHINGTON - The Federal Housing Administration's Mortgagee Review Board (MRB) today announced a settlement agreement with a Massachusetts mortgage lender for failing to fully verify whether borrowers could sustain their mortgage payments prior to refinancing their loans. Among the alleged violations, the MRB claimed First American Mortgage Trust (FAMT) of Brookline, Massachusetts refinanced mortgage loans for borrowers with serious credit delinquencies without properly analyzing the households' ability to manage credit.
As part of the settlement announced today, FAMT agrees to pay $72,500, reimburse FHA for past insurance claims, and to indemnify FHA's insurance fund for any claims to be paid on five mortgages should they default with the next 60 months.
""FHA-approved lenders are obliged to apply our underwriting standards, not only to protect our insurance fund, but to make certain families can sustain their mortgages,"" said Acting FHA Commissioner Bob Ryan. ""Due diligence is at the root of mortgage lending protecting lenders, the FHA, and certainly homeowners from the prospect of foreclosure.""
FHA's Mortgagee Review Board sanctions FHA-approved lenders for violations of the agency's program requirements. For serious violations, the Board can withdraw a lender's FHA approval so that the lender cannot participate in FHA programs. In less serious cases, the Board enters into settlement agreements with lenders to bring them into compliance. The Board can also impose civil money penalties, probation, suspension, and issue letters of reprimand. This fiscal year alone, the MRB took 19 administrative sanctions against lenders, including reprimands, probations, suspensions, withdrawals of approval, and civil money penalties.
Last October, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) proposed new regulations to strengthen its authority to force certain lenders to indemnify or reimburse the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) for insurance claims paid on mortgages that are found not to meet the agency's guidelines. In addition, HUD's proposed rule would require all new and existing lenders with the ability to insure mortgages on HUD's behalf (""Lender Insurance"" mortgagee) to meet stricter performance standards to gain and maintain their approval status.
For those lenders with special authority to insure mortgage loans on FHA's behalf, HUD seeks to force indemnification for 'serious and material' violations of FHA origination requirements such that the mortgage never should have been endorsed by the mortgagee in the first place just as FHA would not have insured the mortgage on its own.
Specifically, these lenders may be required to indemnify HUD if they failed to: (1) verify and analyze the creditworthiness, income, and/or employment of the borrower; (2) verify the source of assets brought by the borrower for payment of the required downpayment and/or closing costs; (3) address property deficiencies identified in the appraisal affecting the health and safety of the occupants or the structural integrity of the property; or (4) ensure that the property appraisal satisfies FHA appraisal requirements. HUD may seek indemnification irrespective of whether the violation caused the mortgage default.
The proposed rule will also require those mortgagees with delegated lender insurance authority to continually maintain an acceptable claim and default rate, both to gain this special lender status as well as to preserve it. HUD proposes that all new unconditional direct endorsement lenders who have the authority to self-insure mortgages must demonstrate a default and claim rate at or below 150 percent for the previous two years. This standard would apply to the state/states where the lender does business, rather than a national default/claim average.
Finally, the FHA will consider the two-year default and claim performance of either entity in the case of acquisition or merger without requiring these entities to seek a waiver. FHA, at its own discretion (without any judicial or administrative action) also clarifies that it has the authority to immediately withdraw a lender's ability to self-insure mortgage loans."
04/11/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-055.cfm,"HUD to Address ""National Origin"" Housing Discrimination During National Fair Housing Month","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it will launch an effort to better address national origin based housing discrimination during Fair Housing Month in April. HUD will initiate a national media campaign and a series of community discussions on topics ranging from rental practices to mortgage lending. HUD's first Immigrant Housing Conference, which will educate the public and housing providers about their fair housing rights and responsibilities, will be conducted in Omaha, Nebraska, April 14.
""The new Census data demonstrate that newcomers are settling not only in traditional gateway states. They reside in communities across the Midwest and South. Through this education campaign, HUD will work with communities to prevent housing discrimination and promote immigrant integration into the broader society,"" said John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in rental, sales or home lending transactions based on a person's national origin. This includes discrimination based on a person's ancestry, country of birth outside the United States, and the language they speak. National origin discrimination often involves immigrants or non-English speaking individuals, but can also involve native-born U. S. citizens based on their family ancestry. This type of discrimination may also occur in conjunction with the other protections of the Fair Housing Act against race, color, religion, gender, disability, and family status discrimination.
One part of HUD's ""Live Free"" national media campaign is a print advertisement featuring a Latino worker looking into the horizon, with a caption in Spanish reading: ""You have the right to live where you choose. Report housing discrimination.""
HUD also recently awarded nearly $41 million to 108 fair housing organizations and non-profit agencies across the country to educate the public and combat housing and lending discrimination. Many of the groups will use the grants to address discrimination against immigrants, Latinos, non-native English speakers and minority communities. See this selected list of grantees and their work.
Some examples of how the grants will be used to combat national origin discrimination include:
The Fair Housing Council of Riverside County, California, will test for discrimination in the sale and rental of housing units in the area of national origin; The Equal Rights Center in Washington, DC, will investigate 240 new complaints of housing discrimination alleging violation of federal fair housing laws with an emphasis on national origin; The Idaho Legal Aid Services will broadcast public service announcements in Spanish about FHA lending information; and Prairie State Legal Services in Rockford, Illinois, will focus on educational outreach to Spanish-speaking residents, a group recognized statewide as at-risk.

Avoid It. Report It. This campaign has two objectives. First, it aims to direct homeowners facing foreclosure to trusted resources and housing counselors. Second, and more importantly, the campaign wants to solicit the support of homeowners in shutting down scammers who regularly target the elderly, Hispanics, and African Americans. Both objectives will be pursued through education and outreach, anti-scam reporting tools, and close cooperation with federal, state, local, and non-profit partners.
Newly deceptive scam artist tactics lure homeowners into misleading agreements. Their tactics include giving the false impression that they are affiliated with the government, charging illegal up-front fees, and executing fraudulent lease-back, financing, and repurchase schemes.
Highlights of the Know It. Avoid It. Report It. campaign include:
Information on how to avoid becoming a victim Scam artist red flags and fraud warning signs Complaint form and hotline to report fraud or suspicious activity Resources for finding HUD-approved counselors and free housing workshops in every state Names of individuals and companies identified by law enforcement agencies who have allegedly committed loan modification fraud or foreclosure relief scams

04/21/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-062.cfm,HUD Selects Lenders to Participate in New Pilot Program to Help Homeowners Pay for Energy Improvements to Their Homes,"WASHINGTON - Eighteen national, regional and local lenders will participate in a new two-year pilot program that will offer qualified borrowers living in certain parts of the country low-cost loans to make energy-saving improvements to their homes. Backed by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), these new PowerSaver loans will offer homeowners up to $25,000 to make energy-efficient improvements of their choice, including the installation of insulation, duct sealing, replacement doors and windows, HVAC systems, water heaters, solar panels, and geothermal systems.
U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Shaun Donovan and U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Steven Chu announced the participating lenders (see attached list) during a tour of a family-run company that offers home energy audits and upgrades in Long Island, New York.
""We believe the market is right for a low-cost financing option for families who want energy-saving technologies in their home,"" said Secretary Donovan. ""PowerSaver hits on all cylinders by helping credit-worthy homeowners finance these upgrades, cut their energy bills and boost the local job market in the process. While FHA and these lenders are jumpstarting this pilot, we hope its success will lead to a growing private sector interest in making these types of loans.""
Secretary Chu said, ""Today, we are breaking down barriers and making energy efficiency more accessible and more affordable. It's the right thing to do for our environment, for our economy and for the pocketbooks of American families.""
The remodeling industry cites surveys that point to a growing demand among homeowners interested in making their homes energy efficient. Yet options are still limited for financing home energy improvements, especially for the many homeowners who are unable to take out a home equity loan or access an affordable consumer loan. Initially, the PowerSaver pilot program is estimated to assist approximately 30,000 homeowners to finance energy-efficient upgrades though higher market demand may increase this impact. According to HUD projections, more than 3,000 jobs will be created through this pilot program and the impact may be larger if market demand for the loan program increases over time.
Participating lenders are largely selected based on their commitment to work in partnership with established home energy retrofit programs provided by states, cities, utilities and home performance contractors. These markets include, but are not limited to areas of the country participating in the Energy Department's Better Building Program (http://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/betterbuildings/about.html).
PowerSaver loans will be backed by the FHA but require these lenders to have significant ""skin in the game."" FHA mortgage insurance will cover up to 90 percent of the loan amount in the event of default. Lenders will retain the remaining risk on each loan, incentivizing responsible underwriting and lending standards.
PowerSaverhas been carefully designed to meet a need in the marketplace for borrowers who have the ability and motivation to take on modest additional debt to realize the savings over time from home energy improvements. PowerSaver loans are only available to borrowers with good credit, manageable debt and at least some equity in their home (maximum 100% combined loan-to-value).
HUD developed PowerSaver as part of the Recovery Through Retrofit initiative launched in May 2009 by Vice President Biden's Middle Class Task Force to develop federal actions that would expand green job opportunities in the United States and boost energy savings by improving home energy efficiency. The announcement is part of an interagency effort including 11 departments and agencies and six White House offices.

""The communities that compete for these grants demonstrate enormous creativity and hard work in leveraging the funds to build better housing, create more jobs, and improve neighborhoods from the ground up. These types of projects are at the backbone of our nation's recovery.""
The application deadline for this year's ICDBG grants is June 15, 2011. The ICDBG program was established in 1974 to help Indian tribes and Alaska Native villages to meet their community development needs. Federally recognized Indian tribes, bands, groups or nations (including Alaska Indian, Aleutes and Eskimos,) or Alaska Native villages compete for this funding.
Communities can use the funding to develop viable communities, including rehabilitating housing or building new housing or to buy land to support new housing construction. The funding can also used to build infrastructure such as roads, water and sewer facilities, to create suitable living environments. To spur economic development, recipients use the grants to establish a wide variety of commercial, industrial and agricultural projects. Recipients have used the funding to build community and health centers, or to start businesses to support the community, such as shopping centers, manufacturing plants, restaurants or convenient stores/gas stations."

04/26/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-066.cfm,HUD Awards $23 Million to 22 Local HIV-AIDS Housing Programs,"WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced that more than a thousand extremely low-income persons living with HIV/AIDS will continue to receive permanent housing as a result of $23 million in grants. During each of the next three years, this HUD funding will help provide permanent supportive housing for 1,015 households so they can manage their illnesses while receiving critically needed support services.
The funding announced today is offered through HUD's Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS Program (HOPWA) and will renew HUD's support of 22 local programs in 18 states (see attached chart and individual project descriptions below).
""These grants are a vital source of support to the local programs that are on the ground working to keep families healthy,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""Knowing that you have a place to call home can make all the difference to the well being of families living with HIV/AIDS, many of whom have been on the brink of homelessness.""
These projects have estimated that about 40 percent of the households to be assisted will involve persons who have been homeless. The grants announced today also support the Obama Administration's new strategic plan to prevent and end homelessness (www.usich.gov/PDF/OpeningDoors_2010_FSPPreventEndHomeless.pdf), an unprecedented initiative announced last June at the White House. In February 2011, HUD released its plan to guide the agency's actions under the National HIV/AIDS Strategy. As the nation's housing agency, HUD will contribute a variety of housing resources to promote better integration of housing interventions into comprehensive HIV care systems.
Housing assistance and related services funded by HOPWA are an essential part of the comprehensive system of care for low-income persons living with HIV/AIDS. A stable home environment is also vital for these households in allowing them to access consistent medical care and maintain their health. Furthermore, secure housing can be a platform for improved quality of life.
Ninety percent of HOPWA funds are distributed by formula to cities and states based on the number of AIDS cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. HUD's formula grants are managed by 124 local and state jurisdictions, which coordinate AIDS housing efforts with other HUD and community resources. HUD is making available a record $334 million in HOPWA funds this year to help communities provide housing for this special needs population. Overall, these resources assist 60,669 households annually to promote stable housing and reduced risks of homelessness for those living with HIV and other challenges."
04/28/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-067.cfm,HUD Secretary Donovan Announces $216 Million in Homeless Grants,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan today awarded more than $216 million to nearly 700 new homeless programs across the country. The grants announced today are $26 million more than last year's grants and, combined with renewal funding announced earlier this year, represents the most homelessness assistance ever awarded by HUD. HUD is also continuing to confront rural homelessness by targeting a record $16.4 million to 87 never-before-funded programs in less populated areas of the country.
In January, HUD awarded more than $1.4 billion in Continuum of Care grants to renew funding to 7,000 existing local homeless programs. The funding announced today will invest in local projects which have never before received HUD homeless funds, providing critically needed housing and support services to an estimated 21,000 homeless individuals and families. Though homelessness is largely an urban phenomenon, HUD is reserving record funding to meet the unique challenges faced by homeless individuals and families living in rural areas.
""Today, we build on the Obama Administration's goal to prevent and end homelessness in America,"" said Donovan. ""This funding will make a significant impact in the lives of thousands of people and provide resources to bring them towards the road of independence.""
HUD's Continuum of Care grants fund a wide range of transitional and permanent housing programs as well as supportive services such as job training, case management, mental health counseling, substance abuse treatment and child care. Street outreach and assessment programs to transitional and permanent housing for homeless persons and families are also funded through these grants. Continuum of Care programs include:
Supportive Housing Program (SHP) offers housing and supportive services to allow homeless persons to live as independently as possible. Shelter Plus Care (S+C) provides housing and supportive services on a long-term basis for homeless persons with disabilities, (primarily those with serious mental illness, chronic problems with alcohol and/or drugs, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or related diseases) and their families who were living in places not intended for human habitation (e.g., streets) or in emergency shelters. Single-Room Occupancy Program (SRO) provides rental assistance for homeless persons in one-person housing units that contain small kitchens, bathrooms, or both.

• Single-Room Occupancy Program (SRO) provides rental assistance for homeless persons in one-person housing units that contain small kitchens, bathrooms, or both.
Last year, 19 federal agencies in the Obama Administration announced a plan to end all homelessness through, Opening Doors, an unprecedented federal strategy to end veteran and chronic homelessness by 2015, and to end homelessness among children, families, and youth by 2020. In addition to the Continuum of Care grant program, HUD's new Homelessness Prevention and Rapid Re-housing (HPRP) Program made possible through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 is making a major contribution to the Opening Doors strategy. To date, HPRP has allocated $1.5 billion to prevent more than 875,000 people from falling into homelessness or to rapidly re-house them if they do.
HUD's homelessness grants are reducing long-term or chronic homelessness in America. Based on the Department's latest Annual Homeless Assessment Report (AHAR), chronic homelessness has declined by 30 percent since 2006. This decline is directly attributed to HUD's homeless grants helping to create significantly more permanent housing for those who might otherwise be living on the streets. It was also reported in the AHAR that the number of homeless families increased for the second consecutive year, almost certainly due to the ongoing effects of the recession.

""These difficult times for our cities, suburbs and rural areas require all of us to work smarter and more efficiently to address the critical needs of our citizens,"" said HUD Assistant Secretary Mercedes Márquez. ""HUD is breaking down silos to offer a more place-based approach to our training and technical assistance. In the end, we're working harder to help communities work better.""
The OneCPD Integrated Practitioner Assistance System represents a fundamental change in the way HUD's traditional ""program-specific"" technical assistance has been structured and delivered over the years. This new ""cross-program"" approach is intended to build the kind of grantee management systems and capacity necessary to successfully carry out comprehensive and sustainable ""place-based"" development and revitalization strategies. Just as importantly, OneCPD will allow grantees to ""tell their story"" of accomplishment by measuring not only the outputs of this technical and capacity building assistance but the outcomes and the impact on their communities as well. The technical and capacity building assistance grants announced today are provided through the Department's Office of Community Planning and Development (CPD).
Included among today's awards are funds to develop and deliver training courses and seminars to improve the core skills commonly needed for the proper administration of many HUD programs. Under HUD Core Curricula for Skills-Based Training, funds will be used to develop ""core curricula"" training for grantees in several areas, including: Development Finance; Environmental Review and Compliance; Asset Management and Preservation of HUD-Assisted Projects; and Construction and Rehabilitation Management.

""Whether it's saving a homeless veteran from a life on the streets or designing a transit-oriented, energy efficient development that revitalizes a blighted neighborhood, these governments prove that working together, we can make a real difference,"" Secretary Donovan said. ""Producing affordable housing is hard work but these jurisdictions are building better communities and creating opportunities for people most in need.""
HUD Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development Mercedes Márquez presented the awards during HUD's HOME Program 20th Anniversary Conference in Bethesda, Maryland.
HUD's HOME Program
The Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act created the HOME Program in 1992. HOME provides formula grants to States and localities that communities use-often in partnership with local nonprofit groups-to fund a wide range of activities that build, buy, and/or rehabilitate affordable housing for rent or homeownership or provide direct rental assistance to low-income people.
Each year, HUD allocates approximately $2 billion to more than 600 State and local participating jurisdictions to increase the stock of affordable housing and provide tenant-based rental assistance for low- and very low-income households. Since the program's inception, the HOME Program has completed more than one million units of affordable housing and provided more than 240,000 families with critically needed rental assistance. Each dollar of HOME funds leverages nearly $4 in other public and private investment and has leveraged more than $78 billion over the life of the program.
Each award-winning project demonstrates how the flexibility provided by the HOME program is used by State and local governments to meet the specific needs of low-income families and underserved populations in their areas. These projects and programs serve as models for other jurisdictions to replicate throughout the country in four categories of innovation -producing producing sustainable housing, promoting long-term affordability, reaching underserved populations and building CHDO (non-profit) capacity.

05/04/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-077.cfm,HUD's Home Program Reaches One Million Mark,"WASHINGTON - Twenty years ago, Senator Alan Cranston, Congressman Henry Gonzalez and housing advocates from across the country designed a new block grant program exclusively dedicated to producing affordable housing. Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME) has produced one million units of affordable housing.
Located in Owensboro, Kentucky, the one-millionth ""HOME unit"" is home to Michelle Nash, a mother of three who helped to construct the three-bedroom, two-bathroom house along with Habitat for Humanity.
""We've come a long way since the HOME Program got its start 20 years ago,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""Today, State and local governments rely on the HOME program to produce affordable homes for very-low and extremely low-income families struggling to find a place to call home. Reaching one million homes proves this landmark production program works!""
Michelle Nash purchased her 1,200 square-foot home for $65,500 after contributing 600 hours of labor and four months of her time toward constructing it. The total cost of construction was $109,260 with a total HOME investment of $35,000. The monthly mortgage is only $400 allowing Michelle to work as a full-time student as she cares her children.
Nash said, ""It's always been my dream to own a home but the tough part was how I was going to achieve this goal. I feel truly blessed that this program has given me the ability to afford a home and provide for my kids.""
""We're ecstatic that Owensboro is home to the one-millionth HOME unit built in America,"" said Mayor Ron Payne. ""Redevelopment is our number one priority in our city. Owensboro remains committed to improving the quality of life for low- to moderate-income families and individuals in our community, by expanding housing choice with quality affordable homes produced with HOME funding.""

05/06/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-080.cfm,Obama Administration Releases April Housing Scorecard,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of the Treasury today released the April edition of the Obama Administration's Housing Scorecard - a comprehensive report on the nation's housing market. Officials caution that the latest housing figures underscore fragility in the housing market and highlight the importance of the Administration's foreclosure-prevention programs, which continue to help tens of thousands of struggling homeowners each month and play a critical role in setting standards for the mortgage industry.
""The housing data in this month's Scorecard offer continued mixed signals and some signs of weakness in the market - despite growing evidence of progress in the broader economy,"" said HUD Assistant Secretary Raphael Bostic. ""The Administration has been consistently committed to helping American homeowners and borrowers who have been hit hard by the economic recession and housing crisis, and our efforts have helped millions to avoid foreclosure and gain a more stable footing. That said, we still have more work to do to reach the many households who still face trouble.""
""The numbers of homeowners both entering HAMP and converting from trial to permanent modifications each month are a powerful reminder of the role this program is playing in delivering much-needed assistance to families facing a housing market that is still very tough,"" said Acting Assistant Secretary for Financial Stability Tim Massad. ""And by providing modifications that are sustainable for homeowners over time, HAMP is setting standards for the industry that ultimately mean more options for more families to avoid foreclosure.""
The March Housing Scorecard features key data on the health of the housing market and the reach of the Administration's foreclosure prevention programs, including:
The Administration's efforts have helped millions of families deal with the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. More than 4.5 million modification arrangements were started between April 2009 and the end of March 2011 - including more than 1.5 million trial modification starts through the Administration's Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP), more than 808,000 FHA loss mitigation and early delinquency interventions, and nearly 2.2 million proprietary modifications under HOPE Now. While some homeowners may have received help from more than one program, the total number of agreements offered more than doubled the number of foreclosure completions for the same period (1.9 million). Tens of thousands of new homeowners continue to receive real payment relief from HAMP every month - and are able to keep up those arrangements over time. In March, servicers reported more than 36,000 trial HAMP modifications and more than 36,000 permanent modifications with a median payment reduction of 37 percent - or over $500 every month. Since the start of the program, more than 670,000 homeowners have received a permanent HAMP modification, saving approximately $5.9 billion. More than 1.5 million homeowners have started a trial modification. With more than 84 percent of homeowners in their permanent HAMP modification after one year, HAMP modifications continue to perform well over time and are proving more sustainable for homeowners than traditional industry modifications. View the March HAMP Servicer Performance Report (www.treasury.gov/initiatives/financial-stability/results/MHA-Reports/Pages/default.aspx). Housing market remains fragile as data through March paint a mixed picture of recovery. Home prices remain weak under continued strain from foreclosures and distressed homes. However, mortgage delinquencies continued a downward trend compared to early 2010 and foreclosure starts and completions remain below peak. As lenders continue to review internal procedures related to foreclosure processing, many foreclosure actions have been delayed. The decline in foreclosure processing is likely to be temporary as lenders eventually revise and resubmit paperwork in the coming months.

05/09/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-082.cfm,"HUD and German Ministry of Transport, Building and Urban Development Agree to Cooperate on Sustainability","WASHINGTON - While the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is working to promote sustainability in this country, the Ministry of Transport, Building and Urban Development (BMVBS) is pursuing a set of similar goals in the Federal Republic of Germany. Today, both agencies signed a Joint Declaration of Intent to work together to cultivate a dual framework to promote more sustainable and livable communities in both nations.
The Declaration signed today between HUD and its German counterpart will support a host of cooperative actions including: exchanging sustainability experts from each organization; sharing information and research; hosting bilateral conferences and other meetings at least twice a year; and sponsoring joint research studies.
""This Joint Declaration reinforces the idea that developing more sustainable communities is something both our nations recognize as critical to our futures,"" said HUD Deputy Secretary Ron Sims during a signing ceremony at HUD Headquarters in Washington. ""The U.S. and Germany share a common vision that we can build a better, more sustainable and livable tomorrow.""
""Our nations are urban nations. Not only does a majority of our people live in cities, they are the pillars of our economies and often focal points of the national heritage in our countries. Our joint action to foster sustainable and successful development for our cities therefore reflects our dedication to improve the living conditions in our societies as a whole,"" emphasized BMVBS State Secretary Rainer Bomba.
Germany and the U.S. already share a set of common interests involving sustainable communities. In the U.S., the Federal Partnership for Sustainable Communities is actively promoting a set of livability principles that include:
Providing more transportation choices; Promoting equitable, affordable housing; Enhancing economic competitiveness; Supporting existing communities; Coordinating policies and leverage investment; and Valuing communities and neighborhoods.
• Providing more transportation choices;
• Promoting equitable, affordable housing;
• Enhancing economic competitiveness;
• Supporting existing communities;
• Coordinating policies and leverage investment; and
• Valuing communities and neighborhoods.
The Federal Republic of Germany and other European Union nations adopted the Leipzig Charter which recommends creating high-quality public spaces, promoting efficient and affordable urban transportation, and improving energy efficiency with a particular emphasis on underserved neighborhoods.
Within this dual framework the topic areas that may be pursued by HUD and the German Ministry include:
• Analysis of integrated urban and regional policies relevant to the development and redevelopment of cities, metropolitan communities and rural areas in a broader framework with coordination of spatial, sectoral and temporal aspects.
• Ways to foster the design and development of sustainable communities through integrated and inter-governmental partnerships in a federal system, with particular attention to transit-oriented development planning and finance;
• Urban economic development and public-private sector investment partnerships, particularly in regard to sustainability, green retrofit, and the revitalization of cities in transition through large scale changes in their employment base;
• Public-private partnership comparisons, in particular the varying degrees and methods of use of private corporate and philanthropic investment with public partners at all levels of government within the revitalization and sustainability themes;
• Urban land use, including green space planning, urban farming and agriculture, temporary greening, brown field rehabilitation, as well as the quality of public spaces, urban man-made landscapes and architecture and their role as locational factors ;
• Construction technology and the development of building codes for safer, more affordable housing, with particular regard to residential energy efficiency, urban energy use, and solar, wind and geothermal housing advances;
• Housing finance policy, including both homeownership and rental programs, and government monitoring of mortgage capital markets;
• Housing rent subsidy programs: design, development, and administration;
• Other national policy and research issues in housing and community development and related issues as may be determined by the two governments.

05/12/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-088.cfm,Three Model Affordable Housing Developments Earn Prestigious HUD Secretary Design Award,"WASHINGTON - Three affordable housing developments are the recipients of the HUD Secretary's Housing and Community Design Award (www.huduser.org/research/secaward.html) for excellence in residential housing design. The U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, in conjunction with the American Institute of Architects, selected the New Carver Apartments in Los Angeles, California; the Haven for Hope homeless facility in San Antonio, Texas; and a renovation of a of a mid-century modern home in Seattle, Washington as models for a new generation of affordable housing.
Danberry Carmon, HUD's Field Office Director in New Orleans, will present the awards this evening during the 2011 AIA National Convention and Design Exposition in New Orleans.
""Whether it is renovating the interior of an existing home to make it more accessible or using innovative architecture to create a service-rich housing development for the homeless, these projects break the old mold and redefine what affordable housing means,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan, himself a trained architect.
The 2011 HUD Secretary's Housing and Community Design Award recipients are:
Excellence in Affordable Housing Design: New Carver Apartments in Los Angeles, California (Submitting Architect: Michael Maltzan)
This award recognizes architecture that demonstrates overall excellence in terms of design in response to both the needs and constraints of affordable housing. This project pushes the boundaries of what affordable housing should look like and how architecture can transform communities. The development revived an underutilized neighborhood in downtown Los Angeles and made no distinction between affordable housing and high-end design. The housing, combined with on-site social services, is the most effective means of permanently ending homelessness in the community. This 97-unit project not only satisfies the needs of the 95 formerly homeless residents, who earn less than 50 percent of the Area Median Income, but provides high-quality and sustainable housing in an area with a critical shortage of affordable housing stock. The project includes a spectrum of social spaces, from the very public - such as the central courtyard - to the very private units with semipublic and semiprivate spaces, like the community kitchen and social service offices. The design provides a safe and secure environment, yet is porous enough to encourage interaction. Financing was provided by the Los Angeles Housing Department and the State of California Department of Housing and Community Development, along with from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.

Community-Informed Design: Haven for Hope in San Antonio, Texas (Submitting Architect: James Andrews)
This award recognizes projects that incorporate housing with other community amenities for the purpose of either revitalization or planned growth. Determined to change the plight of its homeless population, the City of San Antonio, Bexar County, and nonprofit and private organizations worked together to develop a comprehensive campus of transformation to address and treat the root causes of homelessness. Bordering downtown and a low-income community, the site itself was an industrial park that had included several abandoned warehouses. The challenge was to create public spaces that invoked a campus environment while reaching out to the community. Architects and stakeholders held design ""charrettes"" and progress meetings with service providers, interest groups, law enforcement, and neighborhood associations. As a result of this state-of-the art facility, San Antonio-based agencies such as University Health Systems and the Center for Health Care Services have become intimately involved in the operations, and volunteers are an integral part of the campus. It has turned a formerly blighted area into an epicenter of promise and opportunity.

Alan J. Rothman Award for Housing Accessibility: Magnolia Mid-Mod, Seattle, Washington (Submitting Architect: Carol Sundstrom)
The purpose of this award is to recognize exemplary projects that demonstrate excellence in improving housing accessibility for people with disabilities. A whole-house interior renovation of a mid-century modern home, this project had no choice but to be universally designed. It belongs to a family of three: a father and two wheelchair-users (mom and daughter). As the daughter became older, teaching her to cook meant that there were two wheelchairs sharing a tiny U-shaped kitchen and no room for dad to help. With adolescence also came a realization that teenagers need a place to entertain themselves separate from grown-ups. The only room large enough for that purpose offered no privacy. The homeowner's first impulse was to add a second story to the house, but the idea was quickly met with several uncomfortable realities: losing the mid-century scale and charm of the exterior, having to use an elevator multiple times a day, and the price tag. The solution was to find more square footage within the existing exterior walls, spending less, overall, while taking advantage of opportunities to create custom, innovative solutions. As a result, the home is a laboratory for solutions that are both highly functional and universally appealing, with the intent to inspire others to consider the investment potential, both financial and experiential, of planning for a broad range of mobility over a long period of time.

05/17/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-092.cfm,National Healthy Homes Conference to Address Risks from Asthma to Bedbugs,"WASHINGTON - All across America, there are homes that can actually harm those who live in them. From lead-based paint that can poison children, to cancer-causing radon, to cockroach and bedbug infestations. Next month, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is hosting a National Healthy Homes Conference in Denver that will explore the latest research and interventions from dozens of public health, housing, and environmental experts from more than 200 organizations.
From June 20-23, these experts will present findings on how to produce healthier housing for people living with disabilities, including a growing number of adults with autism who are confronted with the lack of supportive housing options.
""It's shocking that the leading causes of preventable death, disease and disability are right in our own homes,"" said HUD Deputy Secretary Ron Sims. ""Home ought to be a place where we feel safest, not a place where we're most likely to get sick or be injured. We need an honest conversation about supporting efforts to improve the health and safety conditions in our homes.""
Asthma, lead poisoning, house fires, falls and drowning in bathtubs are just a few of the hazards that families face. For example, studies find that mold, cockroaches and dust mites trigger more than 4.5 million cases of asthma each year, costing $3.5 billion. In addition, lead poisoning and cancer are caused by lead-based paint and exposure to other environmental toxins, generate an estimated $53 billion in annual medical costs. Hazards that lead to falls and burns add another $222 billion.
To address these critical problems, HUD developed Seven Principles of Healthy Homes:
Dry - Damp houses provide a nurturing environment for mites, roaches, rodents, and molds, all of which are associated with asthma. Clean - Clean homes help reduce pest infestations and exposure to contaminants; Pest-Free - Recent studies show there is a connection between exposure to mice and cockroaches and the development of asthma. Improper treatment of pest infestations can leave pesticide residues, which could cause neurological damage and cancer. Safe - The majority of injuries occur in the home. Falls are the most frequent cause of residential injuries, followed by injuries from objects in the home, burns, and poisonings. Contaminant-Free - It is important to keep homes clear of contaminants such as lead, asbestos particles, radon gas, carbon monoxide, pesticides, volatile organic compounds, and tobacco smoke. Exposures to these contaminants are far higher indoors than outside. Ventilated - Studies show that increasing the fresh air supply in a home improves respiratory health. Even cooking in a poorly-ventilated home can produce harmful pollution. Maintained - Poorly maintained homes are at risk for moisture and pest problems. Lead-based paint in older homes is the primary cause of lead poisoning, which affects some 240,000 U.S. children.

See local funding here. Including today's grants and funding announced earlier this year for this program, HUD has awarded more than 700 agencies across the U.S. nearly $60 million in grants for this purpose.
Funded through HUD's Housing Choice Voucher Family Self-Sufficiency Program (HCV/FSS), the grants allow public housing agencies (PHAs) to work with welfare agencies, schools, businesses, and other local partners to develop a comprehensive program to help individuals already participating in HUD's Housing Choice Voucher Program increase their education or gain marketable skills that will enable them to obtain jobs that pay a living wage.
""This program is absolutely critical in today's economy,"" said Donovan. ""The research demonstrates that this program works. When families are given the tools they need to move beyond the voucher program, they do. Ultimately, they become self-sufficient and more vouchers become available for other families, some who have been waiting for long periods to receive housing assistance. For America to win the future we need a trained and skilled workforce.""
The funding allows local housing authorities to hire coordinators (or caseworkers) to link adults in the Housing Choice Voucher program to local organizations that provide job training, childcare, counseling, transportation and job placement.
Participants in the HCV/FSS program sign a contract that requires the head of the household to get a job and the family will no longer receive welfare assistance at the end of the five-year term. As the family's income rises, a portion of that increased income is deposited in an interest-bearing escrow account. If the family completes its FSS contract, the family receives the escrow funds that it can use for any purpose, including paying educational expenses, starting a business or paying back debts.
The Family Self Sufficiency (FSS) Program is a long-standing resource for increasing economic security and self-sufficiency among HCV participants. A new report issued earlier this year by HUD (www.huduser.org/portal/publications/affhsg/eval_fssp.html) evaluated the effectiveness of the FSS Program. Conducted from 2005 to 2009, HUD's study shows the financial benefits are substantial for participants who remain and complete the program. This study is the second of a three-part series by HUD that evaluate the effects of the FSS program. The first study (www.huduser.org/portal/publications/econdev/selfsufficiency.html) found individuals who participated in the FSS program fared better financially than those who did not enroll in the program. HUD's Office of Policy Development and Research (PD&R) will launch the third and final installment to complete this series this year.
PD&R will also launch two additional studies this year about the FSS program. The first study will examine whether FSS participants who were still enrolled when the Prospective Study ended went on to graduate from the FSS program and whether they met their goals for financial self-sufficiency. The second will study the effectiveness of the FSS program nationally. This will be the first national study of the FSS program as part of HUD's Transformation Initiative, which was created in 2010 to encourage more transparency and accountability within the agency."
05/20/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-093.cfm,HUD Encourages Nation's Housing Authorities to Celebrate Fathers,"WASHINGTON - With the help of hundreds of public housing authorities across the nation, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development is taking Father's Day to a whole new level. HUD appealed to the nation's 3,200 public housing authorities to host Father's Day 2011 on Saturday, June 18th - a day to celebrate fatherhood, family and to support fathers in staying connected with their children.
These public housing agencies are inviting fathers and their children who live in the public housing or the surrounding community to day-long events with a two-fold purpose - to provide fun activities to support the bonding of fathers and their children, while connecting fathers to economic development resources.
Federal partners, including the U.S. Department of Labor, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, United States Department of Agriculture, and the Departments of Education and Justice, are asking their local grantees and offices to offer on-site information and services such as employment resources, healthcare consultation and legal counseling. In some cities, participants will meet athletes from the NFL and NBA, who will join in on the fun while others will receive free books from the Read it LOUD Program.
""Children with involved fathers grow up happier, healthier and better prepared to succeed in life,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan, himself a father of two. ""Yet every night, one-out-of -three American children goes to bed in a home without a father present. These events will bring fathers and their children together and connect the dads to the social and economic resources they need to be the best parents they can be.""
To date nearly 200 housing authorities in 33 states will participate in Fathers Day 2011 and are partnering with other organizations including the NFL, NBA, Boys & Girls Club of America, Legal Services Corporation and the National Fatherhood Initiative (www.fatherhood.org/Page.aspx?pid=192) (NFI), an organization created in 1994 to raise the awareness of the importance of fathers. Together, these groups are delivering a clear message - America needs dads.
According U.S. Census data, 24 million American children live in a home without a father. Also, NFI says children in homes absent a father are five times more likely to be poor; and are more likely to drop out of school or be incarcerated.
HUD's national Father's Day 2011 campaign is in part modeled after the New York City Housing Authority 2010 Fatherhood Initiative, which hosted a day-long event in all five of its boroughs to kick off ongoing economic development, parenting workshops, tutoring and bonding activities for fathers and children.

05/20/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-094.cfm,"HUD Charges Las Vegas-Area Homeowners Association, Property Management Company with Discriminating Against Families with Children","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced that it has charged a Las Vegas, Nevada, homeowners association and its management company with discriminating against families with children by restricting its housing to persons who are 55 and older. Specifically, HUD's charge alleges that Lakeside Village Homeowners Association and Castle Management & Consulting, LLC, did not take the proper steps required to make the community's age restriction legal.
""Limiting housing to adults over age 55 is permitted by the Fair Housing Act only in specific circumstances. HUD insists that homeowner associations fulfill their obligations in order to qualify for an exemption,"" stated John Trasviña, Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD is committed to assist families or unit owners harmed when associations fail to follow the law.""
The Fair Housing Act prohibits homeowners associations and others from discriminating against families with children, unless the housing meets the Fair Housing Act's requirements for housing for older persons. The requirements provide that 80 percent of the units must be occupied by at least one person age 55 or older; that the managers of the housing publish and adhere to policies that demonstrate an intent to be housing for older persons; and that the managers verify occupancy in accordance with the Act's statutory and regulatory requirements.
According to HUD's charge, Roberta Jean Leong was in the process of selling her home to a male buyer under the age of 55 when the deal was terminated because of the Homeowners Association's restrictive age policy. HUD's investigation, however, found that the Homeowners Association did not meet the age exemption requirements of the Fair Housing Act and therefore did not have the legal authority to restrict sales to persons under 55, including families with children.
Lakeside's age restrictions may also affect the ability of other homeowners to sell their homes because the policy is shown on multiple listing services.
The HUD charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages to aggrieved persons for the injury caused to them by the discrimination.
FHEO and its partners in the Fair Housing Assistance Program investigate more than 10,000 housing discrimination complaints annually. People who believe they are the victims of housing discrimination should contact HUD at 1-800-669-9777 (voice), 800-927-9275 (TTY)."
05/20/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-095.cfm,HUD Announces $1.2 Million Settlement with U.S. Bank,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced a settlement with Minneapolis-based U.S. Bank, National Association, the Federal Housing Administration's (FHA) 8th largest mortgage lender.
Under the terms of the settlement announced today, U.S. Bank will pay $1.2 million to resolve allegations that it failed to comply with FHA requirements in connection with 27 mortgage loans. U.S. Bank did not admit any liability. HUD documented losses of more than $465,000 in relation to these loans.
""FHA's underwriting and endorsement standards exist to protect its insurance fund and every family hoping to sustain homeownership,"" said HUD General Counsel Helen Kanovsky. ""We expect our lenders to uphold those standards and we will hold them accountable when they don't.""
The agreement follows a 2006 audit by HUD's Office of Inspector General, which concluded that U.S. Bank failed to meet FHA underwriting standards in connection with mortgage loans originated in 2003 and 2004. FHA generally prohibits the inclusion of overdue principal, interest and late charges in refinanced loans; however the audit found that in some cases U.S. Bank refinanced loans that included such prohibited amounts, among other violations of FHA underwriting requirements. The audit also found that U.S. Bank submitted loans that were in default to HUD for late endorsement. FHA requires that loans not be in default when they are submitted for late endorsement, or more than 60 days after closing.
HUD's Office of Program Enforcement referred the case to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Minnesota, which settled the case."
05/23/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-097.cfm,HUD Awards $153 Million to Revitalize Severely Distressed Public Housing in Eight Communities,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan today awarded $152.7 million to help eight cities across the country transform severely distressed public housing developments into mixed-income communities.
Housing authorities in the following cities developed highly successful revitalization plans to transform the physical condition of a public housing community and make a positive impact on the lives of their residents: Boston, Massachusetts; Denver, Colorado; Louisville, Kentucky; Patterson, New Jersey; St. Louis, Missouri; Taunton, Massachusetts; Phoenix, Arizona; and Portland, Oregon.
""No one can dispute the exceptional track record of HOPE VI to improve housing conditions for hundreds of communities and most importantly, thousands of families,"" said Donovan. ""As we move toward the next generation of neighborhood revitalization - one that links housing, education, transportation, healthcare, and other support services - we will always remember it all began with HOPE VI.""
The following housing authorities are being awarded grants through HUD's HOPE VI Revitalization Program:
Boston Housing Authority will receive $22 million to revitalize the Old Colony public housing development; Housing Authority of the City and County of Denver will receive $22 million to revitalize the South Lincoln public housing development; Louisville Metropolitan Housing Authority will receive $22 million to revitalize the Sheppard Square public housing development; Housing Authority of the City of Paterson (NJ) will receive $18.4 million to revitalize the Alexander Hamilton public housing development; St. Louis Housing Authority will receive $7,829,750 to revitalize the Arthur Blumeyer public housing development; Taunton Housing Authority will receive $22 million to revitalize the Fairfax Gardens public housing development; City of Phoenix Housing Authority will receive $20 million to revitalize the Frank Luke Addition public housing development; and Home Forward (Portland Housing Authority) will receive $18.5 million to revitalize the Hillsdale Terrace public housing development.
• Boston Housing Authority will receive $22 million to revitalize the Old Colony public housing development;
• Housing Authority of the City and County of Denver will receive $22 million to revitalize the South Lincoln public housing development;
• Louisville Metropolitan Housing Authority will receive $22 million to revitalize the Sheppard Square public housing development;
• Housing Authority of the City of Paterson (NJ) will receive $18.4 million to revitalize the Alexander Hamilton public housing development;
• St. Louis Housing Authority will receive $7,829,750 to revitalize the Arthur Blumeyer public housing development;

• City of Phoenix Housing Authority will receive $20 million to revitalize the Frank Luke Addition public housing development; and
• Home Forward (Portland Housing Authority) will receive $18.5 million to revitalize the Hillsdale Terrace public housing development.
The eight housing authorities announced today were selected from among 36 public housing authorities that applied for FY 2010 HOPE VI Revitalization funding. All eight grantees will be funded from both FY 2010 and FY 2011 HOPE VI appropriations. Later this year, HUD will conduct a competition to award $65 million in FY2011 funding to implement the Department's new Choice Neighborhoods Program.
HUD awarded high marks to applicants who plan to extend neighborhood transformation efforts beyond public housing linking housing interventions with early childhood education programs. The Obama Administration is challenging communities to build upon the HOPE VI lessons to employ a comprehensive approach to community transformation. Choice Neighborhoods aims to transform neighborhoods of poverty into viable mixed-income neighborhoods with access to economic opportunities by revitalizing severely distressed public and assisted housing and then linking these neighborhoods to well-functioning services, effective schools, public transportation and jobs.
Housing authorities are competitively selected for HOPE VI grants based on many factors including the effectiveness and project readiness of their revitalization plans. HUD gives recipients the flexibility to develop revitalization plans that meet their local needs. Among other criteria, grantees are selected based on the capacity of their housing authority and its development team to administer and manage completion of the revitalization effort; the severity of physical distress of the development; the ability of the housing authority to supplement the HOPE VI grant with funding from other sources, private, state or local government; the ability to provide supportive services to displaced residents; and the proposed green development and energy efficiency strategies.
Since 1993, HUD has awarded 260 HOPE VI Revitalization grants to 133 housing authorities- totaling nearly $6.3 billion. HUD began awarding HOPE VI grants following a 1992 report by the National Commission on Severely Distressed Public Housing that found approximately 86,000 public housing units in the U.S. needed revitalization. HOPE VI Revitalization grants are used for an array of activities, including: demolition of severely distressed public housing; acquisition of sites for off-site construction; capital costs of major rehabilitation; new construction and other physical improvements; costs for mobility counseling and relocation; and community and supportive service programs for residents, including those relocated as a result of revitalization efforts.

""As President Obama has said, if America is to win the future, we need to out-educate the rest of the world,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""This funding helps public housing agencies that want to provide these services but lacked the resources. This is an investment to make certain we connect affordable housing with quality education and training resources.""
HUD's Capital Fund Education and Training Community Facilities (CFCF) Program provides funding to public housing authorities for the construction, rehabilitation, or purchase of facilities that will offer early childhood education, adult education and job training programs. It is designed primarily for public housing residents, but can be utilized by residents in the surrounding community. The purpose of the facilities is to offer comprehensive, integrated education and employment services to help public housing residents achieve long-term economic self-sufficiency.
HUD required successful applicants to illustrate their ability to get firm financial commitments of at least 5 percent to leverage the HUD grant. The applicants were also required to identify at least one education and/or training supportive service provider, such as a community college, that would partner with the housing authority to provide education and employment services at the facility.

HUD is bringing the charge on behalf of a mother with two children, who alleged that the owner, Robert Gerow, dared her to ""turn him in"" when she protested that his refusal to rent to children was unlawful.
HUD's charge also alleges that the owner's receptionist violated the Fair Housing Act when she, following the owner's instructions, told potential renters and the mother of two that the owner did not want to rent to families with children.
The Fair Housing Act makes it illegal to refuse to rent to families with children.
""For more than two decades, the Fair Housing Act has made it illegal to discriminate against families with children,"" said John Trasvina, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Yet, some housing providers believe they can turn away families with children with impunity. In carrying out its legal responsibilities, HUD makes clear: If you engage in discrimination, expect HUD to enforce the law.""
According to the charge, Robert Gerow advertised in West Lebanon's Valley News seeking a renter for a two-bedroom apartment above his chiropractic office. Gerow allegedly instructed his receptionist to tell callers he did not want children in the apartment.
When the mother of two called and spoke directly to Gerow, he reiterated the restriction. HUD's charge alleges that when the woman told him that his restriction was against the law, Gerow told her to ""turn him in"" and hung up.
The HUD charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages to aggrieved persons for the damages caused them by the discrimination.
The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief to deter further discrimination, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose fines in order to vindicate the public interest. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages to aggrieved persons.
FHEO and its partners in the Fair Housing Assistance Program investigate more than 10,000 housing discrimination complaints annually. People who believe they are the victims of housing discrimination should contact HUD at 1-800-669-9777 (voice), 800-927-9275 (TTY)."
05/27/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-104.cfm,"HUD Awards $15 Million to Help Public Housing Residents Obtain Jobs, Economic Independence","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development awarded today nearly $15 million to more than 200 public housing authorities across the U.S. to help public housing residents find jobs that lead them toward economic independence. For information on local funding amounts, visit HUD's website.
HUD's Public and Indian Housing Family Self-Sufficiency Program, provides this funding to public housing authorities (PHAs) which allows them to hire program coordinators who work directly with residents to connect them with local education and training opportunities; job placement organizations; and local employers. The purpose of the program is to encourage innovative strategies that link public housing assistance with other resources to enable participating families to increase earned income; reduce or eliminate the need for welfare assistance; and make progress toward achieving economic independence and housing self-sufficiency.
""Family self-sufficiency programs have a proven track record of helping families succeed,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan, who announced the grants today. ""When families are given the tools they need to join a skilled workforce they move beyond HUD's rental assistance programs to self-sufficiency. This is how Americans will win the future - individually and collectively.""
Participating public housing residents sign a contract to participate. They outline their responsibilities towards completion of training and employment objectives over a five-year period. For those families receiving welfare assistance, the PHA establishes an interim goal that the participating family becomes independent from welfare assistance prior to the expiration of the contract. During their participation, residents may create an escrow account funded with their increasing income, which they may use in a variety of ways, including continuing their education, making a major purchase or improving their credit score.
The Family Self Sufficiency (FSS) Program is a long-standing resource for increasing economic security and self-sufficiency among public housing and HCV participants. A HUD Prospective Study (www.huduser.org/portal/publications/affhsg/eval_fssp.html), issued earlier this year, evaluated the effectiveness of the FSS Program. Conducted from 2005 to 2009, HUD found substantial financial benefits for participants who complete the program. This study is the second of a three-part evaluation of the FSS program. The first study found individuals who participated in the FSS program fared better financially than those who did not enroll in the program. HUD will launch the third and final study this series this year.
PD&R will also undertake two additional studies this year including an examination of whether certain FSS participants who were still enrolled when the Prospective Study ended went on to graduate from the FSS program and whether they met their goals for financial self-sufficiency. Other study will test the effectiveness of the FSS program nationwide, the first national study of the FSS program as part of HUD's Transformation Initiative, which was created in 2010 to encourage more transparency and accountability within the agency."

The CDBG overall funding was reduced by more than $600 million or approximately 16.5 percent while the HOME program funding was reduced by more than $200 million or approximately 11.7 percent.
""These programs are absolutely critical to communities all across this country,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""The 2011 budget agreement required tough choices, and we would not have made many of them in better circumstances, but beginning to live within our means is the only way to protect those investments that will help America win the future and compete for new jobs.As we work under the challenges of our nation's deficit, we must also understand that these programs are absolutely essential in promoting community development, producing affordable housing, helping our homeless and even supporting long-term disaster recovery.""
HUD's FY 2011 formula-based block grant programs include:
$ 3.3 billion in Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds; $ 1.6 billion in HOME Investment Partnerships (HOME) funding; $ 160 million in Emergency Shelter Grant (ESG); and $ 298 million for Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA). $ 5.4 billion TOTAL
• $ 3.3 billion in Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds;
• $ 1.6 billion in HOME Investment Partnerships (HOME) funding;
• $ 160 million in Emergency Shelter Grant (ESG); and
• $ 298 million for Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA). $ 5.4 billion TOTAL
Since 1974, HUD's Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program has provided approximately $132 billion to state and local governments to target their own community development priorities. The rehabilitation of affordable housing and the improvement of public facilities have traditionally been the largest uses of CDBG although the program is also an important catalyst for job growth and business opportunities. Annual CDBG funds are distributed to communities according to a statutory formula based on a community's population, poverty, and age of its housing stock, and extent of overcrowded housing.
HOME (HOME Investment Partnerships Program) is the largest federal block grant to state and local governments designed exclusively to produce affordable housing for low-income families. Since 1992, HOME has produced 381,883 rental units, assisted 428,373 homebuyers, rehabilitated 197,780 owner-occupied units, and helped 242,768 tenants. In the past two decades, HOME produced more than one million homes for low income families. HOME funding is cost-effective, leveraging nearly $4 in other investments for each HOME dollar spent.
Emergency Shelter Grants (ESG) provides homeless persons with basic shelter and essential supportive services. It can assist with the operational costs of the shelter facility, and for the administration of the grant. ESG also provides short-term homeless prevention assistance to persons at imminent risk of losing their own housing due to eviction, foreclosure, or utility shutoffs. HUD will allocate ESG funds in a two-stage process: (1) $160 million will be immediately allocated under the existing Emergency Shelter Grants regulations; and (2) at least $65 million will be allocated once HUD publishes the new Emergency Solutions Grant regulations.
HUD's Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) grants are distributed to states and cities based on the number of AIDS cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The grants provide resources for operating community residences and providing rental assistance and support services to individuals with HIV/AIDS and their families. In addition, the HOPWA program also helps many communities develop strategic AIDS housing plans and fill in gaps in local systems of care. A stable home environment is a critical component for low-income persons managing complex drug therapies and potential side effects from their treatments.
HUD is instituting several important program priorities in the upcoming year. First, the Department's consolidated planning process will be enhanced. Largely unchanged since the mid-1990s, the 'Con Plan' will be simplified by integrating HUD's technology systems and eliminating the need to prepare a separate annual performance report. Second, HUD's Office of Community Planning and Development is moving rapidly to implement its unified OneCPD technical assistance process which is particularly important as many local governments continue to struggle with budgetary pressures resulting from the economic downturn. Finally, HUD is again urging grantees to consider the needs of returning veterans and their families in the design and administration of these formula programs.

05/31/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-106.cfm,FHA and Fannie Mae Announce Green Refinance Plus to Pay for Energy-Efficient Upgrades in Affordable Apartment Buildings,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan today announced Green Refinance Plus, a program between HUD's Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and Fannie Mae to allow owners of existing affordable rental housing properties to refinance into new mortgages that include funding for energy- and water-saving upgrades, along with other needed property renovations.
Under the program, FHA and Fannie Mae will share the risk on loans to refinance existing rent-restricted projects while permitting owners to borrow additional funds to make energy-saving improvements to their properties.
Donovan and Fannie Mae's Executive Vice President for Multifamily Business Ken Bacon unveiled the program at a senior housing development in the San Francisco Bay Area where HUD is investing in energy-saving green retrofits.
""All across the country, owners of affordable housing properties are looking for a way to refinance their mortgages and to make energy improvements and other needed renovations at the same time,"" said Donovan. ""This program kills two birds with one stone - it preserves our affordable rental stock and it helps finance upgrades that will save energy and money over the long haul. We must make the smart investments in a more energy independent economy. These investments will strengthen our economy, create the new industries and new jobs of the future and reduce our dependence on an ever fluctuating oil market.""
Bacon added, ""Green Refinance Plus supports Fannie Mae's ongoing commitment to creating a more sustainable rental housing market that is affordable to low- and moderate-income families. This program will provide more renters with renovated apartments in which to live, allow building owners to better manage their energy costs, and help communities by reducing the environmental footprint of our rental properties. Leveraging existing technology and expertise to bring proven energy and cost savings to rental housing is a win for everyone.""
California Congressman Pete Stark said, ""Today's event highlights an exciting new refinancing opportunity for owners of affordable housing to make energy- and water-saving upgrades. It's appropriate that the Green Refinance Plus program is being unveiled by Secretary Donovan at the Eden Issei Terrace in Hayward, in the heart of a community poised to help propel our country's clean, green energy economy.""
Approximately every 10-to-15 years, owners of existing multifamily affordable properties typically refinance their mortgages. In older apartment buildings, however, owners are hard-pressed to find additional financing to maintain or improve the physical condition of their properties, including making energy-efficient upgrades. Beginning next month, Fannie Mae and its participating lenders will begin accepting applications to refinance owners' debt as well as improve the energy efficiency of their properties.
Green Refinance Plus is intended to refinance the expiring mortgages of Low Income Housing Tax Credit and other affordable projects and to lower annual operating costs by reducing energy consumption. Fannie Mae and HUD anticipate approximately $100 million in initial refinance volume with an average loan amount of $3.5 to $5 million. FHA will insure up to an additional four-to-five percent of the loan amount, or an average of approximately $150,000 to $250,000 per loan, to provide additional loan funds to pay for i) property improvements that save energy and water costs for owners and tenants, such as energy efficient windows and ENERGY STAR appliances, as well as ii) other needed property renovations.
Property owners will be able to select the energy- efficiency upgrades that make the most economic sense for their properties. Borrowers will obtain a ""Green Physical Needs Assessment"" completed by a qualified provider. This assessment identifies property improvements that both reduce energy and operating costs and will help borrowers make rehabilitation choices that will give them the greatest energy savings for their investment.
Green Refinance Plusis an enhancement of the Fannie Mae/FHA Risk-Share program, begun in the 1990s. It will provide funding for the refinance, preservation and energy-efficient retrofits of older affordable multifamily housing properties, including those that are currently in Fannie Mae's or FHA's portfolios. This program allows for lower debt service coverage and higher loan-to-value ratios, to generate extra loan proceeds for property rehab and energy-efficient retrofits.

05/31/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-107.cfm,HUD Reaches Settlement with Florida Online Advertiser Regarding Discriminatory Ads,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today announced that USA4SALE Network, Inc., has agreed to pay $15,000 to settle claims that it violated the Fair Housing Act when it posted ads on its Web sites that discriminated against families with children. In addition, the company has also agreed to change the way its Web sites filter discriminatory language.
The settlement is the result of a complaint HUD initiated against the Ocala, Florida-based company after it allegedly printed a rental advertisement on its webpage, ocals4sale.com, that stated ""No children, No kids."" The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing discrimination based on family status, including publishing print, broadcast or Internet advertisements that indicate a preference or otherwise discriminate against families with children.
""The Internet has revolutionized the way people search for housing and how housing providers advertise available housing. It cannot be a place to avoid the Fair Housing Act,"" said John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""This voluntary agreement will help housing providers easily meet their responsibilities under the Fair Housing Act.""
According to the voluntary agreement, USA4SALE Network will develop a screening filter that will flag potentially discriminatory ads for human review and train its employees on how to comply with fair housing advertising guidelines. The agreement also calls for the network to donate $7,500 to a HUD-funded state fair housing organization and contribute another $7,500 to a HUD-approved local fair housing group to cover the cost of the group's future fair housing advertisements."
06/01/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-108.cfm,HUD Acts Against Pregnancy Discrimination in Home Mortgages,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today announced a settlement agreement with Cornerstone Mortgage Company (Cornerstone), a national mortgage lender based in Houston, which HUD accused of engaging in discriminatory lending practices against expectant mothers. In a separate action, HUD is charging Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Corporation (MGIC) of Milwaukee, Wisconsin and others with engaging in pregnancy discrimination in issuing mortgage insurance in violation of the Fair Housing Act.
During a news conference, John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, announced the settlement with Cornerstone and laid out the Department's charge against MGIC. The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing discrimination in sales, rental, and lending based on a person's sex or familial status.
""Pregnancy is not a basis to deny or delay a loan. It's just that simple,"" said Trasviña. ""Mortgage professionals may verify income and other resources and have eligibility standards but they may not single out women on maternity leave to deny or delay loans that they are otherwise eligible for.""
Under the terms of the agreement announced today, Cornerstone (doing business as Cornerstone Home Lending) agrees to:
Compensate Dr. Elizabeth Budde $15,000 based on her claims that she was initially denied a mortgage loan even though she was on paid maternity leave and planned to return to work; Create a $750,000 victims' fund to compensate other Cornerstone borrowers who experienced discrimination because they were on pregnancy or maternity leave at the time they were applying for a loan; Notify all borrowers who applied during a two-year time frame of their right to seek compensation if they experienced treatment that was discriminatory because a borrower or co-borrower was pregnant or on maternity leave; and Pay as many as 100 successful claimants a lump sum payment of $7,500 each.
• Compensate Dr. Elizabeth Budde $15,000 based on her claims that she was initially denied a mortgage loan even though she was on paid maternity leave and planned to return to work;
• Create a $750,000 victims' fund to compensate other Cornerstone borrowers who experienced discrimination because they were on pregnancy or maternity leave at the time they were applying for a loan;
• Notify all borrowers who applied during a two-year time frame of their right to seek compensation if they experienced treatment that was discriminatory because a borrower or co-borrower was pregnant or on maternity leave; and
• Pay as many as 100 successful claimants a lump sum payment of $7,500 each.
If there are more than 100 successful claimants, each will receive a prorated share of the compensation fund which will be administered by an independent third party administrator agency. Cornerstone has also adopted a new policy clarifying how it will treat applicants for loans who are on parental leave, including maternity leave, when they apply for a loan. (The policy would also apply to men who are on parental leave due to the birth or adoption of a child.) Read HUD's settlement agreement with Cornerstone.
Meanwhile, HUD is charging MGIC with discriminating against a Pennsylvania family by denying their application for mortgage insurance unless and until the wife returned to work from maternity leave. According to HUD's complaint, on or about July 26, 2010, MGIC wrote an email summarizing the status of the family's loan: ""rec'd updated bank statements along with email from Borrower that states she is on maternity leave....notifying her that we cannot proceed until borrower is back to work full-time.""
Last July, HUD launched multiple investigations into the lending practices of certain mortgage lenders to determine if they illegally denied families mortgages because the mother is pregnant or on pregnancy-related leave. HUD enforces the Fair Housing Act which prohibits discrimination in lending based on sex or familial status (pregnancy or children in the family). The Act protects consumers from being discriminated against because a borrower is on maternity leave if she can demonstrate that she intends to return to work and can otherwise continue to meet the income requirements to qualify for the loan.
HUD's Federal Housing Administration (FHA) requires its approved lenders to review a borrower's income to determine whether they can reasonably be expected to continue paying their mortgage. FHA-insured lenders cannot, however, inquire about future maternity leave. If a borrower is on maternity or short-term disability leave at the time of closing, lenders must document the borrower's intent to return to work, that the borrower has the right to return to work, and that the borrower qualifies for the loan taking into account any reduction of income due to their leave. Meanwhile, HUD is currently reviewing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's underwriting guidelines to determine if they satisfy the Fair Housing Act, including income verification for persons taking maternity or parental leave."
06/02/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-109.cfm,"HUD Provides $15 Million in Rental Assistance to Help Nearly 2,000 Families Stay Together","WASHINGTON - In 2009, an estimated 423,773 children lived in foster care in the U.S. as case workers helped to reunite them with their families or primary caregivers. Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced nearly $15 million to help public housing authorities reunite foster children with their parents or prevent them from ever entering the foster care system. Read a detailed account of the local funding announced today.
HUD's Family Unification Program (FUP) will make 1,931 Housing Choice Vouchers available for families whose inadequate housing is the primary factor in the separation or near separation from their children. In addition, FUP vouchers will provide stable housing for young adults (ages 18-21) who left or are aging out of the foster care system, preventing them from becoming homeless.
""It's heartbreaking to realize that thousands of children live in foster care or forced to live with other families simply because their parents can't afford a home,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""The funding provided today will keep thousands of families together under one roof.""
This funding allows local public housing authorities to work closely with local child welfare agencies to identify families with children in foster care or who are at risk of being placed in foster care and youth at risk of homelessness. These vouchers, like HUD's Housing Choice Vouchers, allow families and youths to rent housing from private landlords and generally pay 30 percent of their monthly income towards rent and utilities.
According to the National Center for Housing and Child Welfare (www.nchcw.org/), it costs the federal government approximately $56,892 annually per family to place children into foster care. Yet the cost to provide housing and supportive services to one family averages less than $14,000 annually. Through this investment in FUP to reunify families who are separated due to housing problems, HUD will reunite nearly 3,500 children with their parents, thus saving $74 million in annual foster care expenditures. Cost savings are also considerable for young people aging out of foster care. The average annual cost of a FUP voucher for young adults is $5,600 - a tenth of the estimated costs associated with undesirable outcomes such as homelessness, incarceration, and residential treatment.
""With this investment of FUP vouchers, Secretary Donovan continues to demonstrate his understanding of the critical role stable housing plays in keeping families together and safe,"" said Ruth White, Executive Director of the National Center for Housing and Child Welfare. ""We applaud HUD for leading the way to kind of interagency resource sharing that will reunify thousands of children with their families, prevent homelessness among youth aging out of foster care, and ultimately reduce costs.""
FY2010 Family Unification Program funding will be distributed to the following states:"
06/02/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-110.cfm,"HUD Approves $14 Million Financing Plan to Replace Critical Access Hospital in Columbus, Montana","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced a commitment to insure a mortgage loan to the Stillwater Hospital Association in Columbus, Montana. The $14.3 million loan is made possible through the Federal Housing Administration's (FHA) Section 242 Hospital Mortgage Insurance Program.
The existing hospital was constructed more than 50 years ago. Space limitations and infrastructure problems in the aging structure necessitate replacement to better serve the community. The FHA-insured mortgage loan will be used to construct an entirely new facility with a new emergency room, inpatient and outpatient surgery areas, laboratory, imaging department, a primary care clinic, and a home health agency. Stillwater Hospital Association is managed by Billings Clinic, Billings, Montana, a tertiary-level hospital that owns and manages six other hospitals and physician clinics in South Central Montana and Wyoming.
""By supporting hospital projects like this one in Montana, FHA is not only helping to expand access to medical care, itis also contributing to the financial well-being of communities by creating jobs to stimulate local economies,"" said Acting FHA Commissioner Robert Ryan.
""Critical access hospitals like this one in Columbus are just that - critical - and it's essential they have the space and facilities to serve the critical needs of Montana patients. This loan to the Stillwater Hospital Association is a smart investment that will support a healthy community and economy for years to come by supporting life-saving care and good-paying Montana jobs during construction and beyond,"" said Montana's senior U.S. Senator Max Baucus.
By insuring the mortgage loan, FHA is enabling the hospital to obtain lower cost financing that will save an estimated $4.2 million in interest expense over the life of the loan. Since 1968, FHA has insured 397 mortgage loans totaling $17.1 billion to hospitals in 43 states and Puerto Rico.
FHA's Section 242 Mortgage Insurance Program for Hospitals enables hospitals to obtain capital to finance new construction and renovation of acute care hospitals. Eligible applicants can be public, proprietary, or nonprofit hospitals certified by the responsible State agency."

Read HUD's FY 2011 Choice Neighborhoods Notice of Funding Availability (www.grants.gov/search/search.do;jsessionid=lpNvNtwQ4MJTj5XQ1v1YG 99YSQfG8FJG2nP9VS1vQGyDQPr6KLc3!1105614407?oppId=98093&mode=VIEW).
""Our Choice Neighborhoods Initiative rewards communities that use innovative tools to tackle concentrated poverty holistically,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""The initiative expands on the bipartisan success of the HOPE VI program by recognizing that we must link affordable housing with quality education, public transportation, good jobs and safe streets. President Obama has said that there is no greater economic policy than one that invests in our children's future and helps America out-educate the world. But that's not possible if we leave a whole generation of children behind in our poorest neighborhoods.""
As part of HUD's overall plan to revitalize areas of concentrated poverty, the Choice Neighborhoods Planning Grants are intended to help transform distressed public and assisted housing into sustainable, mixed-income housing that connects to key services, such as education and transportation, and supports positive outcomes for the neighborhood's families. Eligible applicants are public housing authorities, local governments, nonprofit organizations, and for-profit developers that apply jointly with a public entity. Applicants must demonstrate their plan to revitalize the neighborhood through public-private partnerships that seek to develop high-quality public schools and early learning programs, public transportation, and improved access to jobs and well-functioning services.
These grants will enable communities to create a comprehensive ""transformation plan,"" or road map, to transform public and/or assisted housing within a distressed community to create a choice neighborhood. This Federal support provides a significant incentive and catalyst for the local community to take critical steps toward neighborhood transformation.
Applicants have until August 8, 2011 to apply for the Choice Neighborhoods Planning Grants. HUD anticipates awarding approximately 12 grants with a maximum award of $300,000 each.
Choice Neighborhoods is focused on directing resources to address three core goals - housing, people and neighborhoods. It is a centerpiece of the White House Neighborhood Revitalization Initiative (www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/oua/initiatives/working-groups)(NRI). HUD partners with the Departments of Treasury, Justice, Education, and Health and Human Services on the NRI, an interagency effort to align federal housing, education, justice, and health programs to transform distressed, high-poverty neighborhoods into neighborhoods of opportunity."

The funding will also link the elderly and people with disabilities with supportive services that allow them to maintain independent living and age-in-place. Read more about local impact of HUD's grant funding.
""We need to take a wider view of the needs of public housing residents beyond just housing if we're to be true to the goal of promoting self sufficiency,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""The caseworkers that housing authorities can hire or keep on staff help thousands of public housing residents connect to opportunities to obtain jobs or increase their incomes that lead to self-sufficiency and improve quality of life.""
HUD's Resident Opportunities and Self Sufficiency (ROSS) - Service Coordinators Program helps public housing authorities (PHAs), resident associations or non-profit organizations hire or retain service coordinators who work directly with residents to assess their needs to connect them with education, job training and placement programs and/or computer and financial literacy services available in their community to promote self-sufficiency. For an elderly or disabled resident, the service coordinator arranges supportive services that allow them to maintain their independent lifestyle.
The purpose of HUD's ROSS - Service Coordinators Program is to encourage local, innovative strategies that link public housing assistance with public and private resources to enable participating families to increase earned income; reduce or eliminate the need for welfare assistance; and make progress toward achieving economic independence and housing self-sufficiency.

06/09/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-117.cfm,"Obama Administration Releases May Housing Scorecard Featuring New Making Home Affordable Servicer Assessments, Regional Spotlight on Phoenix Housing Data","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of the Treasury today released the May edition of the Obama Administration's Housing Scorecard. New to this month's report are detailed assessments for the 10 largest mortgage servicers participating in the Administration's Making Home Affordable Program, setting a new industry benchmark for disclosure on servicer assistance to struggling homeowners. In addition to providing greater transparency about servicer performance in the program, the new assessments are intended to prompt mortgage servicers to correct identified deficiencies to improve program implementation and more effectively reach eligible homeowners.
""While we continue to get tens of thousands of new homeowners into mortgage modifications each month, we need servicers to step up their performance to meet the needs of those still struggling,"" said acting Treasury Assistant Secretary for Financial Stability Tim Massad. ""These assessments set a new benchmark by providing an unprecedented level of disclosure around servicer performance and will serve to keep the pressure on servicers to more effectively assist struggling families.""
Since the inception of the Making Home Affordable Program, Treasury has required participating servicers to take specific actions to improve their servicing processes. The new Servicer Assessments summarize performance for the 10 largest Making Home Affordable participating servicers from reviews largely conducted throughout the first quarter of 2011 on three categories of program implementation: identifying and contacting homeowners; homeowner evaluation and assistance; and program reporting, management and governance. Based on the reviews for this quarter, four servicers have been identified as needing substantial improvement and six servicers have been identified as needing moderate improvement. The servicers identified as in need of substantial improvement are:
Bank of America, NA; J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A.; Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC; and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.
• Bank of America, NA;
• J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A.;
• Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC; and
• Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.
While servicers are required to address all instances of non-compliance, beginning this month, the Treasury Department is withholding financial incentives for three servicers: Bank of America, NA; J.P Morgan Chase Bank, NA; and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. Treasury will not withhold financial incentives owed to Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC for this quarter as their compliance results were substantially and negatively affected by a large servicing portfolio acquired during the compliance testing period.
Details on the review process and more information on the Administration's Servicer Assessments, which will be issued on a quarterly basis, can be found at http://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/financial-stability/results/MHA-Reports/Pages/default.aspx.
As the Administration is taking additional steps to push servicers to provide more effective assistance to struggling homeowners through its foreclosure prevention programs, the continued fragility of the housing market demonstrates the need for the Administration's recovery efforts in hard hit communities:
The Administration's efforts have helped millions of families deal with the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. More than 4.8 million modification arrangements were started between April 2009 and the end of March 2011. While some homeowners may have received help from more than one program, the total number of agreements offered more than doubled the number of foreclosure completions for the same period (2 million). In April, 29,000 homeowners received a trial HAMP modification, and 29,000 additional homeowners received a permanent modification with a median payment reduction of 37 percent—or more than $500 every month. View the May HAMP Servicer Performance Report (www.treasury.gov/initiatives/financial-stability/results/MHA-Reports/Pages/default.aspx). Housing market remains fragile as data through May paint a mixed picture of recovery. Home prices remainweak after several straight months of decline. However, CoreLogic reported a minor month-over-month increase for April, and mortgage delinquencies continued a downward trend compared to early 2010. Foreclosure starts and completions remain below peak, though as lenders continue to review internal procedures related to foreclosure processing many foreclosure actions may have been delayed.

Also featured this month is the Administration's first Housing Scorecard Regional Spotlight, which highlights recovery conditions in Phoenix, Arizona, one of the hardest hit areas in the nation following the housing market downturn and an area where the Administration's broad approach to stabilizing the housing market has been very active.
""The housing data in this month's Scorecard offer continued mixed signals and some signs of weakness in the market - despite growing evidence of progress in the broader economy,"" said HUD Assistant Secretary Raphael Bostic. ""The Administration remains committed to helping all homeowners who have been hit hard during this housing crisis, and as the Regional Spotlight shows our efforts have helped over 100,000 families avoid foreclosure in Phoenix. But we have much more work to do to reach the many households who still face trouble and to help the market recover.""
The new Housing Scorecard Regional Spotlight features data on the health of the Phoenix housing market and impact of efforts to help homeowners at the local level including:
Phoenix home prices showed signs of stabilizing during most of 2009 and the first half of 2010, but the overall sales market remains fragile. The home sales market remains soft in Phoenix. Existing home sales rose from 2008 to 2009, though the boost was due in part to sales of distressed homes -- foreclosures and short sales - which currently represent 56 percent of all existing homes sales in the MSA, compared with 35 percent nationally. More than 100,000 Phoenix households have received mortgage modifications, many through direct Administration programs. Since April 1, 2009 more than 65,000 mortgage assistance interventions have been offered to Phoenix area homeowners through the Administration's assistance programs and an estimated 40,000 to 42,000 proprietary modifications have been offered through Hope Now Alliance servicers - a total of 106,500 interventions for the metropolitan area. While some homeowners may have received help from more than one program, more assistance has been offered than foreclosures completed during this period (104,500).

06/13/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-118.cfm,"HUD, VA to Provide Permanent Housing, Case Management to Nearly 700 Homeless Veterans Across the U.S.","WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric K. Shinseki announced today that HUD will provide $5.4 million to public housing authorities in 18 states to supply permanent housing and case management for 676 homeless Veterans in America. This is the fourth and final round of the FY 2010 Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing Program (HUD-VASH) funding to support homeless Veterans.
HUD-VASH is a coordinated effort by HUD, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and local housing authorities to provide permanent supportive housing for homeless Veterans. For a local breakdown of the rental vouchers announced today, visit HUD's website.
""As our young men and women return from Afghanistan and Iraq, they deserve to be treated with dignity and honor. Yet our nation's Veterans are 50 percent more likely than the average American to become homeless,"" said HUD Secretary Donovan. ""These vouchers continue to get more of our Veterans off the streets and out of homeless shelters into permanent housing.""
""Our mission is to end Veterans' homelessness,"" said VA Secretary Shinseki. ""This effort is an excellent example of how VA works with HUD and our community partners in that shared mission. The project-based vouchers will provide dedicated permanent housing for Veterans and allow them to live in support of each other, as neighbors.""
The vouchers announced today are part of a set-aside of project-based vouchers HUD announced last September that would be competitively awarded to housing authorities that received HUD-VASH vouchers in 2008, 2009 or 2010. Under HUD's project-based voucher program, housing authorities can assign voucher assistance to specific housing units. These vouchers will enable homeless Veterans to access affordable housing with an array of supportive services.
This funding to local housing authorities is part of the Obama Administration's strategy to end Veteran and long-term chronic homelessness by 2015. Opening Doors: Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness (www.usich.gov/PDF/FactSheetVeterans.pdf) serves as a roadmap for how the federal government will work with state and local agreements to confront the root causes of homelessness, especially among former Servicemen and women.
The grants announced today are part of a $75 million investment to support the housing needs of homeless Veterans. This is the fourth and final competitive round to allocate the remaining FY2010 HUD-VASH funding. With today's announcement, HUD will have funded 10,186 housing vouchers for homeless Veterans nationwide for FY2010. HUD will announce the 2011 HUD-VASH funding during the summer. VA Medical Centers provide supportive services and case management to eligible homeless Veterans.
Veterans are referred to the public housing authority for these vouchers, based upon a variety of factors, most importantly the need for and ability to benefit from supportive housing. Supportive housing includes both financial help the voucher provides and the comprehensive case management that VAMC staff provides.
Veterans participating in the HUD-VASH program rent privately owned housing and generally contribute no more than 30 percent of their income toward rent. VA offers eligible homeless Veterans clinical and supportive services through its medical centers across the U.S., Guam and Puerto Rico."
06/14/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-119.cfm,"HUD Ruling Awards Nearly $50,000 in Alabama Race Discrimination Case","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced today that a HUD Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) has ordered a Marshall County, Alabama, landlord to pay $49,165 in damages and penalties for violating the Fair Housing Act. HUD initially charged Phillip and Opal Maze, respectively the rental manager and owner of a Marshall County mobile home, with discriminating based on race in December 2009. In an order that became final on May 25, 2011, the ALJ found that Phillip Maze discriminated against a white family and an African American man because one of the family members was dating the African American man.
""Housing providers can't deny you housing or services because they disapprove of the race of your friends or associates,"" said John Trasviña, Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Doing so is unacceptable and strikes at the core of our freedoms. HUD will prosecute these cases fully.""
Phillip Maze's violations include requiring the African American man to leave the premises because of his race; imposing a more restrictive guest policy on the family because they associated with an African American; making statements that indicated a preference based on race; and engaging in coercion and intimidation. Phillip Maze told the family member who was dating the African American man and leasing the mobile home with her sister and her sister's family, that the family had to move out because he didn't believe in interracial dating. He turned off the water to the family's home after observing the African American visitor. When the white female tenant asked what it would take to have the water turned back on, Mr. Maze told her to ""get rid of the black boyfriend.""
The order requires the landlord to pay the white residents and their African American friend $39,165 in damages and to pay the United States a $10,000 civil penalty. The order also requires Phillip Maze to complete fair housing training before renting out any properties in the future. If he then chooses to rent out a dwelling, Mr. Maze has to, among other things, provide the local HUD office with copies of any advertisements or leases associated with the property, and if any applicant is rejected, a statement identifying the reason for the rejection.
FHEO and its partners in the Fair Housing Assistance Program investigate more than 10,000 housing discrimination complaints annually. People who believe they are the victims of housing discrimination should contact HUD at 1-800-669-9777 (voice), 800-927-9275 (TTY)."
06/14/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-120.cfm,HUD and EPA Launch Historic Collaborative Effort to Invest in Sustainable Communities,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lisa Jackson announced a historic collaborative effort to build upon current federal investments for regions that support sustainable and livable communities. For the first time ever, HUD and EPA will join forces to competitively award $5.65 million to strengthen the capacity of existing sustainable communities grantees to create more housing choices, make transportation more efficient and reliable, and support vibrant and healthy neighborhoods for American families.
The award program will build upon the Partnership for Sustainable Communities, an innovative interagency collaboration, launched by President Obama in June 2009, between the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), HUD and EPA to provide more sustainable housing and transportation choices for families and lay the foundation for a 21st century economy. Award recipients will form a national leadership network of existing and future HUD and EPA grantees that are advancing sustainable regional planning and development in their respective contexts and areas. The network of grantees will exchange ideas on successful strategies, lessons learned, emerging tools, and public engagement plans. The Capacity Building for Sustainable Communities grant program will award funds to capacity building service providers who will work directly with grant recipients from the FY2010, and FY 2011 HUD Sustainable Communities Regional Planning and Community Challenge, HUD Preferred Sustainability Status Communities, and EPA Sustainable Community Technical Assistance and Brownfield Area Wide Planning grant programs.
""HUD and EPA's historic joint funding effort represents the Obama Administration's continued commitment to providing innovative solutions toward planning our communities smarter,"" said Donovan. ""With greater capacity, grantees will reinforce the outstanding progress sustainable communities grantees have already made in creating safe, stable communities near good jobs and schools, and businesses.""
""Our partnership with HUD and DOT is helping American communities share best practices, new solutions, and new ways of collaborating to better meet their environmental, housing, and transportation challenges,"" said EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson. ""This latest action will give these communities additional resources they need to make the most of every dollar, empowering them to protect the health of their residents while encouraging economic growth.""
The Partnership's interagency collaboration gets better results for communities and uses taxpayer money more efficiently by coordinating federal investments in infrastructure, facilities, and services that meet multiple economic, environmental, and community objectives with each dollar spent. The Partnership is helping communities across the country to create more housing choices, make transportation more efficient and reliable, reinforce existing investments, and support vibrant and healthy neighborhoods that attract businesses. At a time when every dollar the federal government invests in jumpstarting the economy is critical, the President's plan ensures that all these agencies are coordinating efforts and targeting resources with precision. This grant program will reinforce the principles of the Partnership, and provide the grantees with the necessary tools to build economic competitiveness in their regions.
HUD will take the lead in administering the notice of funding availability (NOFA) while both agencies will collaborate in the review and selection process of the grantees. The grantees must demonstrate significant knowledge, skills, experience, and a cohesive plan for delivering the specific skills and tactics necessary to build the capacity of existing sustainability grantees. Both HUD and EPA contributed funding to the grant opportunity.
Applications for the NOFA are due July 8, 2011. Nonprofit organizations, local or state public agencies, for-profit organizations, nationally recognized and accredited Universities or Colleges, or any combination of eligible entities as a Capacity Building Team are eligible to apply for funding. For more information on how to apply, please review the notice of funding availability (NOFA) on HUD's website."
06/14/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-121.cfm,HUD Issues 2010 Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress,"WASHINGTON - According to its latest national homeless assessment, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development reports the number of homeless persons in the U.S. held steady between 2009 and 2010, despite the economic downturn. For the first time, HUD's annual report reveals how the Recovery Act's Homelessness Prevention and Rapid Re-Housing Program (HPRP) helped to mitigate homelessness in America, assisting nearly 700,000 persons in the first year of the program.
""It's clear that had it not been for President Obama's Recovery Act, many hundreds of thousands of persons may have fallen into homelessness or remained there,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""During the height of our nation's economic hardship, we've managed to stabilize and even prevent homelessness as we work to find permanent housing solutions for the most vulnerable among us.""
Based on data collected from thousands of local communities, HUD's 2010 Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress finds a continued decline in the number of persons experiencing long-term homelessness due to the dramatic increase in the number of permanent supportive housing units. Those who were chronically homeless - persons with severe disabilities and long homeless histories - decreased one percent between 2009 and 2010, from 110,917 to 109,920. Since 2007, the number of people who are chronically homelessness has decreased by 11 percent, partially due to the number of 34 percent increase in permanent supportive housing beds during that same timeframe.
Homelessness Prevention and Rapid Re-housing Program - Approximately 690,000 people received assistance in the first year of the HPRP including 531,000 (77 percent) individuals who were prevented from becoming homelessness in the first place. The remaining 159,000 (23 percent) persons received 'rapid re-housing' assistance to move from the streets or shelters into permanent housing.
Most HPRP participants (59 percent) received assistance for two months or less. Participants receiving homelessness prevention assistance had slightly longer lengths of participation than persons receiving rapid re-housing assistance because prevention assistance was more likely to be provided on a recurring basis, while rapid re-housing was more likely to be one-time assistance - such as a security deposit.
HUD's annual assessment is based on two measures of homelessness:
Point-In-Time 'Snapshot' Counts - these data account for sheltered and unsheltered homeless persons on a single night, usually at the end of January. The number of people experiencing homelessness on a single night increased by 1.1 percent over the last year: from 643,067 in January 2009 to 649,879 in January 2010. A total of 79,344 family households, and 241,621 persons in families, were homeless on the night of the 2010 PIT count. Since 2009, the number of homeless families increased 1.1 percent, and the number of homeless persons in families increased 1.5 percent 12-Month Counts - Using Homeless Management Information Systems (HMIS),these dataprovide more detailed information on persons who access a shelter over the course of a full year. In 2010, 411 communities covering over 4,700 cities and counties submitted useable HMIS data resulting in a 23 percent increase from 2009. This increase results in more precise results as HMIS data collection and reporting capacities continue to improve. HUD estimates that 1.6 million persons experienced homelessness and found shelter between October 1, 2009 and September 30, 2010, a 2.2 percent increase from 2009. The characteristics of sheltered homeless individuals are very different from the characteristics of sheltered persons in families. Individuals are more likely to be white men, over 30 years old, and have a disabling condition, while adults in families are more likely to be younger African-American women without a reported disability. Of all those who sought emergency shelter or transitional housing during 2010, the following characteristics were observed: 78 percent of all sheltered homeless persons are adults. 62 percent are male. 58 percent are members of a minority group. 37 percent are 31-to-50 years old. 63 percent are in one-person households. 37 percent have a disability.

HUD's report also reveals the following trends:
From 2007-2010:
Since 2007, the annual number of people using homeless shelters in principal cities has decreased 17 percent (from 1.2 million to 1.0 million), and the annual number of people using homeless shelters in suburban and rural areas has increased 57 percent (from 367,000 to 576,000). The number of homeless persons in families has increased by 20 percent from 2007 to 2010, and families currently represent a much larger share of the total sheltered population than ever before. The proportion of homeless people who are using emergency shelter and transitional housing as part of a family has increased from 30 percent to 35 percent during this same period. The increase in sheltered family homelessness is almost certainly a consequence of the economy. Despite increases over the past year, there has been overall a 3.3 percent decline in the number of homeless persons from 2007 to 2010: a 3.6 percent decline for individuals and a 2.8 percent decline for persons in families. The overall decline in homelessness during this period can be attributed to a steep drop in homelessness in Los Angeles between 2007 and 2009. There were almost 94,000 more sheltered homeless persons in families in 2010 as there were in 2007, and almost 72,000 fewer sheltered homeless individuals. The number of sheltered homeless individuals has declined six percent since 2007, from 1.15 million to 1.04 million.
• Since 2007, the annual number of people using homeless shelters in principal cities has decreased 17 percent (from 1.2 million to 1.0 million), and the annual number of people using homeless shelters in suburban and rural areas has increased 57 percent (from 367,000 to 576,000).
• The number of homeless persons in families has increased by 20 percent from 2007 to 2010, and families currently represent a much larger share of the total sheltered population than ever before.

Looking Ahead
The long-term impacts of the recession are unclear. A recent study found a nearly five-fold increase in the rate of housing overcrowding, suggesting that many families are doubling up in response to the economic downturn. If some of these family support networks already are struggling to make ends meet, some of the doubled-up families may find their way into the homeless residential service system during 2010.
HUD will use the findings from the 2010 AHAR to continue to work to end all homelessness through the Obama Administration's initiative, Opening Doors, an unprecedented federal strategy to end veteran and chronic homelessness by 2015, and to end homelessness among children, families, and youth by 2020."
06/15/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-122.cfm,Donovan Announces $27 Million in Sweat Equity Grants,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today awarded $26.7 million in ""sweat equity"" grants to produce at least 1,500 affordable homes for low-income individuals and families. Funded through HUD's Self-Help Homeownership Opportunity Program (SHOP), the funding awarded today, along with the labor contributed by these households, will significantly lower the cost of homeownership.
""These grants are about rolling up your sleeves and getting the job done,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""With a little investment and a lot of elbow grease, these organizations, volunteers and the families work side-by-side to build their homes from the ground up.""
The following organizations will receive SHOP funds:
The SHOP program provides federal grants on a competitive basis to national and regional nonprofit organizations and consortia that have experience in administering self-help housing programs. The funds must be used to purchase land and install or improve infrastructure, which together may not exceed an average investment of $15,000 per dwelling. Grantees may carry out activities directly and/or propose to distribute SHOP funds to local nonprofit affiliates that will acquire and prepare the land for construction, select homebuyers, coordinate the homebuyer sweat equity and volunteer efforts, and assist in the arrangement of interim and permanent financing for the homebuyers.
Homebuyers must contribute a minimum of 100 hours of sweat equity on the construction of their homes and/or the homes of other homebuyers participating in the local self-help housing program. Self-help housing or sweat equity involves the homebuyer's participation in the construction of the housing, which can include, but is not limited to, assisting in the painting, carpentry, trim work, drywall, roofing and siding for the housing. All newly constructed units must receive certification as an ENERGY STAR Qualified New Home and all appliances and products or features which are replaced in rehabilitated units must be ENERGY STAR qualified.
Labor contributed by volunteers also helps buyers who are unable to perform their sweat equity tasks due to disabilities. The sweat equity and labor contributions by the homebuyers and volunteers significantly reduce the cost of the housing.
Most of the families who benefit from SHOP homes are first-time homeowners so the new home fulfills a lifelong dream. The organizations that receive the SHOP grants also ensure the new homeowners can afford to stay in their homes for the long term to provide a safe, healthy, stable environment to raise children, access jobs and build community.
Since 1996, when Congress first appropriated SHOP funds, the program and numerous volunteers has provided more than $360 million in federal grants to create more than 23,000 units of affordable, homeownership housing that have transformed lives and neighborhoods."

06/16/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-124.cfm,Housing Authorities Gearing Up for Father's Day Celebrations,"WASHINGTON - All across the U.S., public housing authorities are gearing up for Father's Day weekend. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development is excited that approximately 200 agencies across the nation answered HUD's call to host Father's Day 2011 events this Saturday - the day before the official Father's Day - to celebrate fatherhood, family and to support dads in staying connected with their children. To see what housing authorities are hosting events in your area, visit Father's Day 2011 Housing Authorities.
In towns, big and small, public housing authorities will use the day to celebrate fatherhood and the importance of dads being connected with their children who live in public housing or surrounding communities. The events have a two-fold purpose: Providing fun activities to support the bonding of fathers and their children and connecting fathers to economic development resources.
""Saturday's events speak directly to President Obama's recently announced Fatherhood and Mentoring Initiative, Strong Fathers, Strong Families,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan, himself a father of two. ""Children with involved fathers grow up happier, healthier and better prepared to succeed in life. Yet every night, one-out-of-three American kids go to bed in a home without a father present. Our hope is the resources provided at these events will leave fathers feeling stronger and better prepared in their desire to be the best parents they can be.""
The local offices of other federal agencies, including the U.S. Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, Agriculture, Education and Justice, are getting ready to offer on-site information and services such as employment resources, healthcare consultation and legal counseling this weekend. In some cities, participants will meet athletes from the NFL and NBA, who will join in on the fun, while the Read it LOUD! (www.readitloud.org/) Foundation has already distributed more than 1,600 free children's books to participating housing authorities.
Nearly 200 housing authorities in 34 states and the U.S. Virgin Islands will participate in Fathers Day 2011 and have partnered with other organizations the Boys & Girls Club of America, Legal Services Corporation and the National Fatherhood Initiative (NFI) (www.fatherhood.org/Page.aspx?pid=192), an organization created in 1994 to raise the awareness of the importance of fathers. Together, these groups are delivering a clear message — America needs dads.
According U.S. Census data, 24 million American children live in a home without a father. Also, NFI says children in homes absent a father are five times more likely to be poor; and are more likely to drop out of school or be incarcerated.
HUD's national Father's Day 2011 campaign is in part modeled after the New York City Housing Authority 2010 Fatherhood Initiative, which hosted a day-long event in all five of its boroughs to kick off ongoing economic development, parenting workshops, tutoring and bonding activities for fathers and children."
06/20/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-126.cfm,HUD and Neighborworks America Announce Emergency Homeowners' Loan Program,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in conjunction with NeighborWorks® America announced the launch of the Emergency Homeowners' Loan Program (EHLP) today, to help homeowners who are at risk of foreclosure in 27 states across the country and Puerto Rico.
Congress provided $1 billion dollars to HUD, as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, to implement EHLP. The program will assist homeowners who have experienced a reduction in income and are at risk of foreclosure due to involuntary unemployment, underemployment, due to economic conditions or a medical condition.
Under EHLP program guidelines eligible homeowners can qualify for an interest free loan which pays a portion of their monthly mortgage for up to two years, or up to $50,000, whichever comes first.
""Through the Emergency Homeowners' Loan Program the Obama Administration is continung our strong commitment to help keep families in their homes during tough economic times,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""Working with our community partners across the nation through NeighborWorks® America, we are pleased to launch this program today in 27 states and Puerto Rico to help families keep their homes while looking for work or recovering from illness.""
The EHLP program will pay a portion of an approved applicant's monthly mortgage including missed mortgage payments or past due charges including principal, interest, taxes, insurances, and attorney fees. EHLP is expected to aid up to 30,000 distressed borrowers, with an average loan of approximately $35,000.
""Through our work around the country, NeighborWorks® America knows all too well that in these tough economic times, homeowners facing foreclosure are seeking help wherever they can find it. The deadline is July 22, 2011, so we encourage homeowners to apply now in order to find out if they qualify for this new mortgage assistance program and learn more about the many options available to assist those with housing needs,"" stated Eileen M. Fitzgerald, CEO of NeighborWorks® America.
The EHLP program is a complement to the Hardest Hit Fund which makes available $7.6 billion to 18 states and the District of Columbia that were hardest hit by the housing crisis. The EHLP program will be offered in the following states: Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming and Puerto Rico. Five states operating substantially similar programs are administering EHLP directly: Connecticut, Delaware, Idaho, Maryland, and Pennsylvania. With today's launch, mortgage assistance is now available for unemployed and underemployed homeowners in every state.
Contact information for participating agencies, the Pre-Applicant Screening Worksheet and more information on the EHLP program and its eligibility requirements can be found at www.FindEHLP.org or by calling toll free at 855-FIND-EHLP (346-3345).

06/21/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-125.cfm,New Edition of Evidence Matters Focuses on Rental Housing Policy,"WASHINGTON - The spring edition of Evidence Matters (www.huduser.org/portal/evidence.html""), HUD's quarterly publication that informs readers on issues related to housing and community development, is available today. This issue focuses on affordable rental housing policy and the role it will play as America debates the priority it places on homeownership.
""As HUD continues to address the foreclosure crisis facing our nation, we must not forget there has been another crisis in communities across the country for much longer - an affordable rental housing crisis,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""The body of work in this edition of Evidence Matters examines proposals from prominent housing experts on ways to address affordable rental housing policy in America.""
The lead article, Informing the Next Generation of Rental Housing Policy, focuses on several proposals that came out of the Next Generation Housing Policy Conference held October 2010. The Conference, sponsored by the White House, HUD and the Departments of Treasury and Agriculture, brought together prominent housing experts and practitioners to discuss, among other topics, the role affordable rental housing plays in improving life outcomes, particularly for children, families and the homeless.
Along with the conference summary, this edition of Evidence Matters also focuses on three other policy issues - rental housing market dynamics; the role of bank consortia in financing affordable housing; and the debate over a key piece of housing tax policy. A feature on rental market research sheds light on current rental conditions and challenges prevailing assumptions about the size and scale of the rental stock and the availability of affordable rental homes.
Another feature, Multibank Consortia Sustain Communities by Advancing Affordable Rental Housing, highlights the key role of partnerships among banks in creating and preserving affordable rental homes, often without government subsidy. Lastly, this issue includes the perspectives of three prominent economists, Edward Glaeser, David Crowe, and Todd Sinai, on the mortgage interest deduction.
In an effort to promote a new generation of data-driven and evidence-based policymaking, HUD's Office of Policy Development and Research launched Evidence Matters in February. It is a quarterly publication intended to inform housing and community development advocates, state and local policymakers, Congress and researchers on new approaches to issues related to housing and community development. Evidence Matters is an objective, unbiased publication intended to inform the broad housing and community development field on future policy directions based on research and data - in short, the evidence."
06/21/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-127.cfm,HUD Secretary Donovan Announces $67 Million in Grants Will Soon Be Available in Second Round of Sustainable Communities Regional Planning Grant Program,"WASHINGTON - Today, U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan announced that HUD will be investing an additional $67 million towards creating stronger, more sustainable communities that connect housing to jobs while fostering local innovation and building a clean energy economy through its Sustainable Communities Regional Planning Grant program.
HUD provided advance notice today that the second round of Regional Planning grants will soon be made available through a Notice of Funding Availability. The grants will be awarded competitively to multi-jurisdictional and multi-sector partnerships as well as regional consortia consisting of state and local governments, metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs), educational institutions, non-profit organizations and philanthropic organizations. This year's funding was approved by Congress in HUD's 2011 budget, as part of $100 million devoted to the agency's Office of Sustainable Housing and Communities. To read the full text of HUD's advance funding announcement, visit HUD's Sustainability website.
""I am pleased to continue HUD's commitment toward supporting regional planning for sustainable communities by announcing that we will soon make $67 million in new funding to this important grant program,"" said Donovan. ""On the heels of the second anniversary of the Partnership for Sustainable Communities these grants will further the Obama Administration's commitment to help communities nationwide improve access to affordable housing, increase transportation options, and lower transportation costs while protecting the environment and people's health.""
This year's Regional Planning Grant program will encourage grantees to support regional planning efforts that integrate housing, land-use, economic and workforce development, transportation, and infrastructure developments in a manner that empowers regions to consider how all of these factors work together to bring economic competitiveness and revitalization to a community. The program will place a priority on partnerships, including the collaboration of arts and culture, philanthropy, and innovative ideas to the regional planning process.
Recognizing that areas are in different stages of achieving sustainability, HUD will establish two funding categories for the Sustainable Communities Regional Planning Grant program.
Category 1 Funds: Can be used to support the preparation of Regional Plans for sustainable development. Category 2 Funds: Can be used to support efforts to modify existing regional plans so that they are in accordance with the Partnership for Sustainable Communities' six Livability Principles. Category 2 Funds also may be used to prepare more detailed execution plans for an adopted regional plan for sustainable development and limit predevelopment planning activities for catalytic projects.
• Category 1 Funds: Can be used to support the preparation of Regional Plans for sustainable development.

Category 2 Funds also may be used to prepare more detailed execution plans for an adopted regional plan for sustainable development and limit predevelopment planning activities for catalytic projects.
The grant program builds on the Partnership for Sustainable Communities, an innovative interagency collaboration, launched by President Obama in June 2009, between the Department of Transportation (DOT), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and HUD to provide more sustainable housing and transportation choices for families and lay the foundation for a 21st century economy. Guided by six Livability Principles, the Partnership is designed to remove the traditional silos that exist between federal departments and strategically target the agencies' transportation, land use, environmental, housing and community development resources to provide communities the resources they need to build more livable, sustainable communities. Last week, the Partnership marked its second anniversary through a website, www.sustainablecommunities.gov, which provides a one-stop shop for best practices, grant announcement and accomplishments of the Partnership.
In 2010, HUD awarded $100 million in Regional Planning grants to 45 rural and metropolitan regions around the country, with $25 million dedicated to areas with populations less than 500,000. This year, HUD is renewing that commitment by allocating at least $25 million from the second round of grants for regions with populations less than 500,000. Currently, more than 75 million people live in regions supported through the first generation of Sustainable Communities Regional Planning Grants.
Ultimately, this regional planning initiative will provide a blueprint for public and private investment decisions that will support a more sustainable future for a region. The size of grants awarded will be determined by the size of the applicants geographic area, whether a large metropolitan region or a smaller rural community. Grant applications, which will be reviewed not only by HUD, but by DOT and EPA and several other federal agencies, will be due later this summer.
In addition, Secretary Donovan and HUD are committed to providing the highest level of transparency possible as the Office of Sustainable Communities works to streamline federal investments. HUD's new sustainability website will allow tax payers to see where funds are being spent and hold federal leaders accountable, and for local partners to access valuable information and resources."

06/23/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-130.cfm,HUD Announces $210 Million in Initial Indian Housing Block Grants,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today announced nearly $210 million in Indian Housing Block Grant (IHBG) allocations to 146 tribes in 25 states (see attached list). These funds are distributed each year based on a formula to eligible Indian tribes or their tribally designated housing entities for a range of affordable housing activities.
IHBG funds are intended to primarily benefit low-income families living on Indian reservations or in other American Indian communities. The amount of each grant is based on a formula that considers local needs and housing units under management by the tribe or designated entity.
""HUD recognizes the right of Indian self-determination and tribal self-governance by allowing the recipients the flexibility to design and implement appropriate, place-based housing programs, according to local needs and customs,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""In addition, these grants will help support jobs in areas where they are needed the most.""
Eligible activities for the funds include housing development, assistance to housing developed under the Indian Housing Program, housing services to eligible families and individuals, crime prevention and safety, and model activities that provide creative approaches to solving affordable housing problems. The block grant approach to housing was enabled by the Native American Housing Assistance and Self Determination Act of 1996 (NAHASDA)."
06/24/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-132.cfm,New HUD Study: $26 Billion in Major Repairs Needed in Public Housing,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today released a study that finds the nation's 1.2 million public housing units need an estimated $25.6 billion for large scale repairs. This study updates a 1998 analysis and includes costs to address overdue repairs, accessibility improvements for disabled residents, lead abatement, and water and energy conservation that would make the homes more cost effective and energy efficient.
HUD's study, Capital Needs in the Public Housing Program, updates the national estimate of capital needs in the public housing stock in the U.S. Unlike routine maintenance, capital needs are the large-scale improvements required to make the housing decent and economically sustainable, such as replacing roofs or updating plumbing and electrical systems to increase energy efficiency. The study also includes the first extensive look at the estimated cost of energy and water conservation projects.
""The new capital needs estimate far exceeds our annual budget for these repairs and illustrates why America needs a long-term strategy to address the loss of thousands of public housing units annually,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""At a time when budget deficits require the Federal government to tighten its belt, many of the nation's public housing units are buckling under a severe backlog in capital needs. Public housing owners are forced to make tough choices between repairing roofs and replacing plumbing - or worse, demolishing units altogether - because there simply isn't enough money to go around. That's why we introduced Choice Neighborhoods and our new Rental Assistance Demonstration as part of our comprehensive strategy to keep these homes on firm financial footing.""
Despite public housing programs created to address severely distressed public housing, such as HOPE VI, or initiatives to raise capital to make major improvements to the public housing stock, such as HUD's Capital Fund Financing Program, the country is still losing several thousands of public housing units per year. And even though housing authorities have renovated and developed nearly 380,000 publicly owned affordable homes using the $4 billion they received through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the need for a solution to preserve the housing stock remains great.
In November 2007, Congress directed HUD to compute new national estimates of capital needs and compare them to prior estimates from 1998. HUD began the new study in April 2008 and determined the total capital needs estimate, commonly referred to as the ""backlog,"" is $25.6 billion or approximately $23,365 per unit. Moreover, the study determined that with normal use and aging, each year the units accrue an additional $3.4 billion of needed repairs and replacements - or roughly $3,155 per unit. These accrual costs exclude routine maintenance costs and are calculated based on the assumption that the backlog is met.
According to HUD's analysis, a simple comparison of 1998 and 2010 data reveals the estimated total backlog of capital need decreased by approximately 3.4 percent over 12 years. Part of this decrease is explained by a nine percent decline in public housing units in 2010 and an increase in average per unit repair cost. The new study estimated that annual accrual needs climbed by 15 percent from 1998, due in part to lagging repairs to major systems that eroded their overall lifespan.
HUD has proposed a number of new initiatives to address this backlog, including Choice Neighborhoods and the Rental Assistance Demonstration RAD). Choice Neighborhoods provides grant funding to demolish and redevelop public and assisted housing while RAD seeks to address the backlog and future need in the entire public housing stock by allowing private investment in the stock. Both programs are part of a comprehensive strategy proposed by the Obama Administration to offer a long term solution to preserve and enhance the country's affordable housing stock, including leveraging public and private funding to make much-needed improvements."
06/29/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-133.cfm,HUD Announces Final Rule Setting Standards for State Compliance with Safe Act,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today announced publication of a final rule setting the minimum standards that states must meet to comply with the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 (SAFE Act) in licensing mortgage loan originators. The final rule is posted for public display on the Federal Register's Electronic Public Inspection Desk today and will be published in tomorrow's Federal Register (www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2011-06-30/pdf/2011-15672.pdf).
The SAFE Act sets nationwide standards for licensing of mortgage loan originators and is an important step in returning integrity and accountability to the residential mortgage loan market,"" said Acting FHA Commissioner Robert Ryan. ""All 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands have enacted legislation to support this law and our final rule provides clarification of the minimum standards against which each state's laws and regulations will be evaluated.""
While states are charged with enacting licensing standards that meet the requirements of the SAFE Act, overall responsibility for interpretation, implementation, and compliance was delegated to HUD. However, the Act was amended by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and the authorities and duties delegated to HUD by the SAFE Act will be transferred on July 21, 2011, to the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) established by the Dodd-Frank Act.
The final rule explains the criteria that will be used to determine whether a state has put in place a system for licensing and registering mortgage loan originators as required by the SAFE Act. The rule does so by clarifying the meaning of ""engaging in the business of a loan originator,"" which determines whether an individual must be licensed, and the rule also provides that certain activities do not amount to engaging in the business of a loan originator.
The rule further clarifies that employees of government agencies and bona fide nonprofit organizations who act as loan originators only as part of their duties do not engage in the business of a loan originator and do not require licensure by states.
The final rule does not define the terms of ""loan originator"" or ""business of a mortgage loan originator"" to include individuals who only engage in loan modifications or are third-party loan modification specialists. Instead, HUD defers to the CFPB the issue of whether such individuals should be licensed under the SAFE Act, or should otherwise be regulated under other CFPB regulatory authority.
The SAFE Act was enacted into law on July 30, 2008, as part of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008. It is designed to enhance consumer protection and reduce fraud by establishing minimum standards for the licensing and registration of state-licensed mortgage loan originators. SAFE also mandates the creation of a Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry (NMLSR), and encourages all states to provide for a licensing and regulatory regime for all residential mortgage loan originators.
To comply with the Act, states have put in place statutory and regulatory frameworks that require originators to take initial and continuing education courses, pass a test, and undergo civil, criminal and financial background checks. In any State that fails to have in place a licensing system that meets the minimum requirements, mortgage loan originators may be required to be licensed under a federal program.
HUD received more than 5,000 comments on its proposal that led to this final rule. Though minimum standards have been established and clarified, States have the right to enact additional legislation and rules, and to take actions that exceed the federal SAFE Act minimum requirements."
06/29/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-135.cfm,HUD Taps Wize to Lead Virgin Islands Housing Authority Board,"WASHINGTON - Kimberly Wize, a U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) senior advisor for public housing programs, will serve as the new administrative receiver and one-person board of commissioners for the Virgin Islands Housing Authority (VIHA) effective July 1st. HUD announced Wize replaces Mirza Negron Morales, a HUD Deputy Regional Administrator, who served two years in this capacity.
""Under Mirza's stewardship, the Virgin Islands Housing Authority has turned an important corner and I thank her for her hard work. However, we also recognize that there is still important work to be done,"" said Sandra B. Henriquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for the Office of Public and Indian Housing. ""We're thrilled that Kimberly will be on board soon to lend her substantial public housing expertise to this important assignment.""
In her new role, Wize will provide oversight and ensure rules, regulations and agreements undertaken by the housing authority are in line with the housing authority's mission. She will attend and conduct regular board meetings to provide direction as HUD continues its administrative receivership of the agency.
Wize joined HUD in 2008 as a senior program advisor for HUD's Headquarters Office of Field Operations. Out-stationed in HUD's Indianapolis Field Office, Wize works closely with troubled housing authorities and serves as an expert on development activities. Wize has more than 18 years of affordable housing experience, including direct public housing agency knowledge. She was the chief operations officer of the Indianapolis Housing Agency and was the executive director of the Indiana Housing Finance Agency (renamed The Indiana Housing & Community Development Authority) after holding other key senior level positions within the agency. Wize held various positions with the Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency and was executive director of the Coalition for Homelessness Intervention and Prevention based in Indianapolis.
""We have no doubt that Kimberly will bring nothing but positive oversight and expertise to this role,"" said Negron Morales, who made the announcement today at a VIHA board meeting. ""I am confident VIHA Executive Director Robert Graham has a steady and experienced hand to work with.""
Last October, Negron Morales was appointed Deputy Regional Administrator for HUD's New York Regional Office requiring she assume agency-wide management and oversight responsibilities throughout New York and New Jersey.
HUD assumed control of VIHA in 2003 after the agency repeatedly failed to submit balanced budgets, violating HUD's financial reporting requirements, and general deterioration of operations and physical condition of the public housing, including many health and safety violations. HUD recovery teams resolved numerous financial and management deficiencies, leading to improved conditions of the public housing stock on St. Thomas and St. Croix. In 2008, HUD selected Robert Graham, a certified property manager with public housing experience, as the executive director. He has maintained day-to-day operations and has taken positive steps to improve conditions for residents and overall management of the agency."
06/30/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-134.cfm,HUD Announces Revised Disclosure Notice on Protecting Homeownership Rights of the Military,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today announced a revised Notice of Disclosure form that emphasizes the rights of the active duty military and their dependents who are protected under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act.
The Act mandates that military personnel on active duty in wartime are entitled to mortgage relief, including a lower interest rate (not more than six percent) on their mortgages and foreclosure protection. It states that a foreclosure proceeding against certain military personnel, who are recalled to active duty, is not valid unless the creditor has obtained a court order approving it and further states that the courts may stop the proceedings for a time or adjust the debt.
""We all stand behind the men and women of our military when they are called upon to serve,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act enables our armed forces to focus on their mission abroad, without worrying about their families at home.""
The form explains:
Who May Be Entitled to Legal Protections Under the SCRA? What Legal Protections are Servicemembers Entitled to Under the SCRA? How Does a Servicemember or Dependent Request Relief Under the SCRA? How Does a Servicemember or Dependent Obtain Information About the SCRA?
• Who May Be Entitled to Legal Protections Under the SCRA?
• What Legal Protections are Servicemembers Entitled to Under the SCRA?
• How Does a Servicemember or Dependent Request Relief Under the SCRA?
• How Does a Servicemember or Dependent Obtain Information About the SCRA?
A written request and a copy of military orders must be sent to a lender in order for a servicememeber to get interest rate relief and foreclosure protection under the Act. In its revised form, however, the Notice of Disclosure emphasizes that there is no requirement thereafter for servicemembers to alert their lenders of their military status in connection with a foreclosure. It is the lenders responsibility to make that determination and to send a copy of the Notice of Disclosure to homeowners, who are in default on a mortgage.
The Notice advises servicemembers seeking relief to call 1 (800) 342-9647 or visit www.militaryonesource.com/scra for additional information and guidance. It also provides guidance on obtaining military legal assistance."
06/30/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-136.cfm,FHA Issues Condominium Policy Mortgagee Letter,"WASHINGTON - The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) today published updated condominium policy guidelines and instructions that clarify the approval and recertification process and policies for condo projects. FHA's mortgagee letter includes a Condominium Policy Guide and Implementation Schedule identifying timelines for lenders to comply with the guidelines.
""Today, we institute revised guidelines that preserve FHA's role in the condo marketplace during these difficult times while making certain we manage risk in a responsible way,"" said FHA's Acting Commissioner Robert Ryan. ""This guidance formalizes and expands the policies we put in place in 2009 and lays the groundwork for a more formal rulemaking process going forward.""
FHA's mortgage letter and guide will:
Consolidate guidelines published in 2009; Provide a single source of information for the Condominium Approval and Recertification Process; Update, consolidate and clarify existing condominium policy guidance; and Expand FHA's flexibility to consider exceptions at the individual project level
• Consolidate guidelines published in 2009;
• Provide a single source of information for the Condominium Approval and Recertification Process;
• Update, consolidate and clarify existing condominium policy guidance; and
• Expand FHA's flexibility to consider exceptions at the individual project level
Condominium project approval can be issued by FHA staff or by lenders who have delegated approval authority. In addition, FHA's Homeownership Centers will have greater flexibility to make determinations to address individual circumstances on a one-on-one basis.
The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA) transferred FHA's condominium mortgage insurance authority from Section 234 of the National Housing Act to Section 203, thereby requiring the issuance of updated administrative guidance as well as new underlying regulations. The Mortgagee Letter (ML) and Guide published today define the requirements for obtaining, recertifying and maintaining condominium project approval. Later this year, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) will publish proposed rules on FHA's condominium program and seek formal comment from interested parties.

07/01/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-137.cfm,Obama Administration Releases June Housing Scorecard,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of the Treasury today released the June edition of the Obama Administration's Housing Scorecard - a comprehensive report on the nation's housing market. The latest housing data offer continued mixed signals as home prices turned slightly upward, though they showed continued strain from foreclosures and distressed homes. As more homeowners secure mortgage relief, fewer borrowers entered the foreclosure pipeline in June. The full report is available online at www.hud.gov/scorecard.
""The housing data in this month's Scorecard paint a mixed picture of the housing market, despite growing evidence of progress in the broader economy,"" said HUD Assistant Secretary Raphael Bostic. ""Last month we saw a slight uptick in home prices and a continued decline in mortgage defaults as our foreclosure prevention programs reach more borrowers upstream in the process. But we have much more work to do to reach the many households who still face trouble and to help the market recover. That is why this Administration continues to push for effective implementation of our recovery programs as we continue to help homeowners through this crisis.""
""The Administration remains committed to reaching homeowners who are still struggling so that our country can fully recover from an unprecedented housing crisis,"" said Treasury Assistant Secretary for Financial Stability Tim Massad. ""The Administration's programs continue to benefit tens of thousands of additional homeowners every month, while keeping the pressure on mortgage servicers to offer more sustainable assistance to prevent avoidable foreclosures.""
The June Housing Scorecard features key data on the health of the housing market and the impact of the Administration's foreclosure prevention programs, including:
Fewer homeowners are falling into foreclosure as the Administration continues to push servicers to provide more effective assistance to troubled borrowers. In May, 4.3 percent of prime mortgages were at least 30 days late - a significant decline from the peak of 5.9 percent seen in 2010. Moreover, seriously delinquent prime mortgages - those at least 90 days late or in foreclosure - dropped by 22 percent from a high of 1.9 million recorded last year. As new delinquencies decrease across the nation, the number of new homeowners seeking assistance through the Administration's programs may also decrease. The Administration's recovery efforts have helped millions of families deal with the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. Nearly 5 million modification arrangements were started between April 2009 and the end of April 2011. While some homeowners may have received help from more than one program, the total number of agreements offered continues to more than double the number of foreclosure completions for the same period (2.1 million). In May, more than 32,000 additional homeowners received a permanent modification through the Administration's Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP); more than 730,000 homeowners across the country have received a HAMP permanent modification to date, reducing their mortgage burden by over $6.8 billion. Even as new delinquencies begin to fall, eligible homeowners entering HAMP have a high likelihood of securing a permanent modification and realizing long-term success - the rate of modifications moving from trial to permanent is up to 71 percent, and the average time to convert from a trial to permanent modification is down to 3 1/2 months.

07/06/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-138.cfm,HUD and Louisiana Announce Settlement Agreement to End Legal Challenge to Road Home Program,"WASHINGTON - Homeowners living in Cameron, Orleans, Plaquemines, and St. Bernard Parishes may be eligible for additional compensation under the Louisiana's Road Home Program under the terms of a settlement agreement announced today by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the State of Louisiana and plaintiffs in a federal housing discrimination lawsuit. Read the full text of the agreement announced today.
HUD, Louisiana, the Greater New Orleans Fair Housing Action Center, National Fair Housing Alliance and others agreed to end a legal challenge to the State's Road Home Program. Under the terms of the agreement, Louisiana will award an estimated $62 million under its new Blight Reduction Grant Adjustment Program (http://www.doa.louisiana.gov/cdbg/DR/News%20Items/APA51rel5-11.htm). Additional assistance under this anti-blight effort will be awarded to an approximately 1,300 homeowners in those four parishes who received compensation under Option 1 of the State's Road Home Program based upon the pre-storm value of their damaged homes, and as a result still have not been able to repair and re-occupy their homes.
""This agreement is a huge help to families who clearly want to get back into in their homes but continue to struggle to make the needed repairs to their properties,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""While this additional compensation goes a long way to helping folks complete their recovery, we're also going to make sure that those who left their blighted properties behind are held accountable.""
Louisiana Commissioner of Administration Paul Rainwater said, ""Our goal in Louisiana has always been to provide the resources necessary to allow residents impacted by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita to return home, regardless of race or status. We recognize that many households face remaining challenges in their rebuilding efforts and we are hopeful that additional assistance through our Blight Reduction Grant Adjustment and other rebuilding programs will help bring even more Louisiana families home. I am glad that we will be able to close this chapter of the Road Home and to move forward.""
""Regrettably, the Road Home program became a road block for many,"" said James Perry, Executive Director of the Greater New Orleans Fair Housing Action Center. ""This settlement is a step in the right direction toward getting more hurricane-affected homeowners back into their homes and making good on America's promise to build a better New Orleans in a way that is fair and equitable for all people regardless of their race.""
Since Hurricane Katrina and Rita, HUD allocated more than $13.4 billion through the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program to support the State's long-term disaster recovery. The Louisiana rebuilding plan, known as the Road Home Program offered up to $150,000 to families whose properties were damaged or destroyed and who committed to rebuilding their homes in Louisiana and reoccupying them within three years. However, some families were unable to complete their repairs due to their relatively low Road Home Program grant award amounts and high construction costs.
Nearly six years after Hurricane Katrina, Cameron, Orleans, Plaquemines, and St. Bernard Parishes continue to struggle with blight more than all other Hurricane Katrina or Rita damaged parishes. The additional compensation provided through this supplemental Road Home grant amount will help mend neighborhoods and assist struggling homeowners to complete their repairs and reoccupy their homes.
According to Louisiana's plan, existing Road Home applicants must meet all of the following criteria to qualify for additional compensation under the BRGA:
Must be a Road Home applicant who selected Option 1 and intends on repairing or rebuilding their damaged home; The damaged home must have been in one of the four most impacted parishes (Orleans, St Bernard, Plaquemines or Cameron); The applicant's original Road Home grant is significantly constrained by the Road Home determined Pre-Storm Value (PSV); The PSV upon which the original grant is based was at or below the 55th percentile of the parish; As of May 1, 2011, the homeowner has been unable to complete repairs and return to their damaged property or has returned without repairing the property and it is uninhabitable under the applicable codes and ordinances of the local jurisdiction; and The homeowner agrees to participate in a construction advisory services program offered by the State to help guide the homeowners in the continued efforts to restore their lives.
• Must be a Road Home applicant who selected Option 1 and intends on repairing or rebuilding their damaged home;
• The damaged home must have been in one of the four most impacted parishes (Orleans, St Bernard, Plaquemines or Cameron);
• The applicant's original Road Home grant is significantly constrained by the Road Home determined Pre-Storm Value (PSV);
• The PSV upon which the original grant is based was at or below the 55th percentile of the parish;
• As of May 1, 2011, the homeowner has been unable to complete repairs and return to their damaged property or has returned without repairing the property and it is uninhabitable under the applicable codes and ordinances of the local jurisdiction; and
• The homeowner agrees to participate in a construction advisory services program offered by the State to help guide the homeowners in the continued efforts to restore their lives.
In October of 2009, HUD worked with the State of Louisiana to remove the $50,000 cap on 'additional compensation grants' for low- and moderate-income homeowners who applied for assistance under Option 1 of the Road Home Program. To date, the State has disbursed more than $470 million to lower income families, the majority of whom are minority households living in Orleans Parish. Together with the BRGA, these two measures will provide more than a half billion dollars in rebuilding assistance to struggling storm damaged homeowners."
07/07/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-139.cfm,Obama Administration Offers Additional Mortgage Relief to Unemployed Homeowners,"WASHINGTON - Today, the Obama Administration announced adjustments to Federal Housing Administration (FHA) requirements that will require servicers to extend the forbearance period for unemployed homeowners to 12 months. The Administration also intends to require servicers participating in the Making Home Affordable Program (MHA) to extend the minimum forbearance period to 12 months wherever possible under regulator and investor guidelines. These adjustments will provide much needed assistance for unemployed homeowners trying to stay in their homes while seeking re-employment. These changes are intended to set a standard for the mortgage industry to provide more robust assistance to unemployed homeowners in the economic downturn.
The changes to FHA's Special Forbearance Program announced today will require servicers to extend the forbearance period for FHA borrowers who qualify for the program from four months to 12 months and remove upfront hurdles to make it easier for unemployed borrowers to qualify.
""The current unemployment forbearance programs have mandatory periods that are inadequate for the majority of unemployed borrowers,"" U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan said. ""Today, 60 percent of the unemployed have been out of work for more than three months and 45 percent have been out of work for more than six. Providing the option for a year of forbearance will give struggling homeowners a substantially greater chance of finding employment before they lose their home.""
Changes to MHA's Home Affordable Unemployment Program (UP) will require participating servicers to extend the minimum forbearance period from 3 months to 12 months for eligible unemployed homeowners, whenever possible subject to investor and regulator guidance for each mortgage loan. Additionally, forbearance under UP will become available to borrowers who are seriously delinquent.
All FHA-approved servicers must participate in FHA's Loss Mitigation Program, which includes the Special Forbearance program. In addition to extending the forbearance period and removing the up-front hurdles for borrowers, the FHA also reemphasized its requirement that servicers conduct a review at the end of the forbearance period to evaluate the borrower for all additional, applicable foreclosure assistance programs and notify the borrower in writing whether or not he/she qualifies for any other available option. If the borrower does not qualify for any foreclosure assistance option, the servicer must provide the borrower with the reason for denial and allow the borrower at least seven calendar days to submit additional information that may impact the servicer's evaluation.
These reforms build on successful Administration initiatives to support unemployed borrowers through the $7.6 billion Hardest Hit Fund and the $1 billion Emergency Homeowner Loan Program (EHLP). The Hardest Hit Fund, first announced in February 2010, provides support to 18 states and the District of Columbia, which represent the areas hardest hit by steep home price declines and unemployment, to design and implement programs to help struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure. Participating states have dedicated approximately seventy percent of program funds toward programs to help homeowners struggling with unemployment or underemployment. As of this month, each participating state is accepting applications from borrowers and providing direct mortgage assistance to those that qualify.
The EHLP program complements the Hardest Hit Fund, by serving the remaining 32 states and Puerto Rico. Congress provided $1 billion dollars to HUD, as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, to implement the recently launched program. EHLP assists homeowners who have experienced a reduction in income and are at risk of foreclosure due to involuntary unemployment, underemployment due to economic conditions or a medical condition. EHLP is expected to aid up to 30,000 distressed borrowers, with an average loan of approximately $35,000.

To help cut energy bills and consumption, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Council of Large Public Housing Authorities (CLPHA) will host ""Going Green: Intelligent Investments for Public Housing"" an energy conservation conference on July 13-14, 2011 in Boston.
The two-day gathering at the Boston Park Plaza Hotel and Towers will showcase methods to make public housing more energy efficient and sustainable in its daily operations, including: cost-effective strategies to reduce energy and water consumption for housing operators and residents; discussions about sustainable construction; and building smarter with the latest energy efficient technology. Attendees will include public housing authorities, private energy sector groups, plus leaders in the green building movement.
""Going green in public housing means reducing energy costs and improving the lives of the residents,"" said Sandra B. Henriquez, HUD's Assistant Secretary for the Office of Public and Indian Housing. ""By incorporating energy efficient measures into public housing, we have the opportunity to make a real impact on our environment and in the lives of thousands of families.""

In addition, Jim Hunt, Boston's Chief of Environmental and Energy Services will join landscape architect Tim Duggan from the Make It Right Foundation (www.makeitrightnola.org/) to keynote an afternoon session on the second day. Actor Brad Pitt created the foundation to help rebuild homes in New Orleans' Lower Ninth Ward that Hurricane Katrina destroyed in 2005. Participants can also see green building firsthand on a tour of Boston's Maverick Landing, a HOPE VI development that incorporated green building practices during construction."
07/11/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-141.cfm,"Obama Administration Launches Strong Cities, Strong Communities to Support Local Development","WASHINGTON - Today, the Obama Administration launched Strong Cities, Strong Communities (SC2), a new and customized pilot initiative to strengthen local capacity and spark economic growth in local communities, while ensuring taxpayer dollars are used wisely and efficiently. To accomplish this, federal agencies will provide experienced staff to work directly with six cities: Chester, PA; Cleveland, OH; Detroit, MI; Fresno, CA; Memphis, TN; and New Orleans, LA. These teams will work with local governments, the private sector, and other institutions to leverage federal dollars and support the work being done at the local level to encourage economic growth community development.
Additionally, communities nationwide will be eligible to compete for comprehensive economic planning assistance through a grant competition designed to spark local innovation. By integrating government investments and partnering with local communities, SC2 channels the resources of the federal government to help empower cities as they develop and implement their vision for economic growth.
""Over the past two and a half years, the Obama Administration received feedback from leaders all across the country who described the kind of partnership that would be most useful to them for economic growth,"" said Domestic Policy Director Melody Barnes. ""The result is Strong Cities, Strong Communities, an innovative new pilot that will help strengthen local communities while also delivering federal resources and assistance more effectively.""
Added Senior Advisor to the President Valerie Jarrett, ""This is exactly the kind of federal initiative that President Obama pledged to create - one that respects the wisdom of local leadership and helps mayors and other local officials utilize federal resources more effectively. President Obama has consistently demonstrated his commitment to a robust partnership with America's cities and counties - Strong Cities, Strong Communities is yet another example of this important partnership.""
""Strong Cities, Strong Communities is a program that will help us make Detroit a city that works,"" said Mayor Dave Bing. ""The support of the Obama Administration is critical as we continue to strengthen neighborhoods, put Detroiters back to work and improve essential services such as transportation.""
Through this pilot, the Obama Administration will focus on three key goals:
Improving the way federal government does business: Cutting through red tape and rationalizing the federal bureaucracy to help deal with the overlapping maze of agencies, regulations and program requirements that are sometimes confusing to local governments; Providing assistance and support - working with local communities to find ground up, not top down solutions: Providing on the ground technical assistance and planning resources tailored to local governments' needs and helping them use the federal funds they already receive more efficiently and effectively; and Partnering for growth: Developing critical partnerships with key local and regional stakeholders that encompass not only municipal and state governments, but also new partnerships with the business community, non-profits, anchor institutions, faith-based institutions, and other public, private, and philanthropic leaders.
• Improving the way federal government does business: Cutting through red tape and rationalizing the federal bureaucracy to help deal with the overlapping maze of agencies, regulations and program requirements that are sometimes confusing to local governments;
• Providing assistance and support - working with local communities to find ground up, not top down solutions: Providing on the ground technical assistance and planning resources tailored to local governments' needs and helping them use the federal funds they already receive more efficiently and effectively; and
• Partnering for growth: Developing critical partnerships with key local and regional stakeholders that encompass not only municipal and state governments, but also new partnerships with the business community, non-profits, anchor institutions, faith-based institutions, and other public, private, and philanthropic leaders.
""On behalf of the Obama Administration, it is an honor to announce the SC2 initiative in Detroit, one of America's most unique and vibrant cities,"" said U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""This will be a new type of federal partnership for Detroit - one that will allow the city to build on its progress and further strengthen its foundation for economic growth and resiliency in a global economy.""
In addition to building the capacity of local governments, SC2 aims to encourage partnerships among local community organizations, anchor institutions, businesses, foundations and government agencies, helping to leverage federal investments and increase impact. The four components of SC2 include:
SC2 Community Solutions Teams: Community Solutions Teams comprised of federal employees from several different agencies will work directly with cities to support mayors in Chester, PA; Cleveland, OH; Detroit, MI; Fresno, CA; Memphis, TN; and New Orleans, LA. Community Solutions Teams will assist cities with issues mayors have identified as vital to their economic strategies, including efforts to build on local assets, strengthen regional economies, develop transportation infrastructure, improve job-training programs and support community revitalization. In Detroit, the CST will be composed of representatives from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, U.S. Department of Labor, U.S. Department of Transportation, U.S. Department of Commerce and the Small Business Administration. SC2 Fellowship Program: A complement to the Community Solutions Teams, a new fellowship program will select, train, and place early- to mid-career professionals to serve multi-year terms in local government positions to give cities additional capacity. An intermediary will be selected to run the fellowship program, and Fellows will be selected through a competitive national process. The Program will be funded primarily by philanthropic partners; the Rockefeller Foundation is providing $2.5 million in initial funding. SC2 Economic Planning Challenge: In addition to the six pilot locations, SC2 includes an Economic Planning Challenge designed to help additional cities develop economic blueprints. This national grant competition will enable cities to adopt and implement innovative economic development strategies to support comprehensive city and regional planning efforts. Six cities will be competitively selected to receive a grant of approximately $1 million that they will use to administer an ""X-prize style"" competition, whereby they will challenge multi-disciplinary teams of experts to develop comprehensive economic and land use proposals for their city. The Challenge will be administered by EDA, and EDA will assist cities in the administration of the competition. National Resource Network: Pending authorization of funding, the National Resource Network (NRN) will aggregate public and private resources to provide a broader set of cities, towns and regions with access to a one-stop portal of national experts to provide holistic policy and implementation support. Once funds are secured, HUD will host a competition to select an intermediary to run the NRN. Cities, towns and regions will apply to get access to the NRN, and outside experts will apply to be able to provide consulting services through the NRN. A menu of customized and comprehensive technical assistance in a variety of policy areas will be available to communities, delivered through on-site training and staff development. The NRN will also foster peer-to-peer learning to strengthen the network of urban practitioners and thinkers.

SC2 pilot cities were selected on the basis of economic need, strong local leadership and collaboration, potential for economic growth, geographic diversity, and the ability to test the SC2 model across a range of environments. Federal assessment teams spent time on the ground working directly with mayors and other local officials to determine needs, opportunities and gather input for the pilot initiative."
07/11/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-142.cfm,HUD Settles Respa Kickback Case Against Fidelity National Financial,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced an agreement with Fidelity National Financial, Inc. (FNF) to settle allegations the title company paid real estate brokers and other settlement service providers improper kickbacks or referral fees in violation of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA). Read the full text of the agreement announced today.
HUD claimed FNF and its affiliates and subsidiaries engaged in a widespread and years-long campaign to pay real estate brokers kickbacks for the referral of real estate settlement services, including home warranties and title insurance. FNF agreed to cease this practice and pay HUD $4.5 million to resolve the complaint.
""RESPA is very clear that paying fees or providing anything of value for the simple act of referring business is a violation of law,"" said Acting FHA Commissioner Robert Ryan. ""This agreement should be a signal to others that these business practices won't be tolerated.""
HUD alleges that FNF, through its subsidiaries, paid fees for the referral of settlement service business in violation of Section 8 of RESPA. To facilitate these payments, real estate brokerages entered into ""Application Service Provider Agreements"" which provided the real estate brokerages access to TransactionPoint, a web-based platform that automates the real estate transaction from listing to closing. This online system also allows the brokers to select real estate settlement providers for a particular real estate transaction. The real estate brokerages, in turn, entered into Sub-License Agreements with subsidiaries of FNF to enable FNF's subsidiaries to be listed in TransactionPoint as a provider of settlement services. As part of the Sub-Licensee Agreement, HUD alleges that FNF's subsidiaries paid the real estate brokerages a fee for each referral of real estate settlement services.
RESPA was enacted in 1974 to provide consumers advance disclosures of settlement charges and to prohibit illegal kickbacks and excessive fees in the homebuying process. Section 8 of RESPA prohibits a person from giving or accepting anything of value in exchange for the referral of settlement service business."
07/12/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-143.cfm,"HUD Awards $1.9 Billion to Improve, Preserve Nation's Public Housing Stock","WASHINGTON - U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan today awarded more than $1.9 billion to public housing authorities in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The funds will allow these agencies to make major large-scale improvements to their public housing units. View a full list of public housing authorities receiving funding.
HUD's Capital Fund Program provides annual funding to all public housing authorities to build, repair, renovate and/or modernize the public housing in their communities. This funding can be used to make large-scale improvements such as new roofs and to make energy-efficient upgrades to replace old plumbing and electrical systems.
""While this funding will certainly help housing authorities address long-standing capital improvements, it only scratches the surface in addressing the deep backlog we're seeing across the country,"" said Donovan. ""Housing Authorities need nearly $26 billion to keep these homes safe and decent for families, but given our budget realities, we must find other, innovative ways to confront the decline of our public housing stock. That's why we introduced our new Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) as part of our comprehensive strategy to keep these homes on firm financial footing.""
Sandra B. Henriquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, added, ""Unless we transform the way we fund our public housing authorities, local managers will be increasingly forced to choose between repairing roofs, replacing plumbing, or worst of all, demolishing or selling their properties. We simply can't afford to let that happen.""
Earlier this month, HUD released Capital Needs in the Public Housing Program, a study that updated the national estimate of capital needs in the public housing stock in the U.S. The study found the nation's 1.2 million public housing units are facing an estimated $25.6 billion in much-needed large scale repairs. Unlike routine maintenance, capital needs are the large-scale improvements required to make the housing decent and economically sustainable, such as replacing roofs or updating plumbing and electrical systems to increase energy efficiency. This study updates a 1998 analysis and includes costs to address overdue repairs, accessibility improvements for disabled residents, lead abatement, and water and energy conservation that would make the homes more cost effective and energy efficient.
Over the last 75 years, the Federal Government has invested billions in the development and maintenance of public and multifamily housing - including providing critical support through HUD's Capital Fund. Still, the nation continues to lose thousands of public housing units annually, primarily due to disrepair. To protect the considerable Federal investment and respond to the growing demand for affordable rental housing, the Obama Administration has proposed a comprehensive strategy to preserve this inventory. HUD's Transforming Rental Assistance Initiative will allow housing authorities to leverage public and private financing to address capital needs and make public housing units affordable for the long term.
In FY 2012, HUD is requesting $200 million for a Transforming Rental Assistance demonstration to rehabilitate federally subsidized affordable housing, including public and multifamily housing units. The Rental Assistance Demonstration would allow owners to continue to make standard life-cycle improvements to this inventory, modernize or replace obsolete units, and stem the loss of stock from private sector partners choosing to opt-out of affordable housing programs. The funds used to bring 255,000 properties into a reliable, long term, project-based rental assistance contract will enable public housing authorities to raise more than $6.1 billion in private financing to reduce the large backlog of capital repair needs and in the process, support significant job creation in communities across the country."
07/13/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-146.cfm,HUD Settles Allegations That Prospect Mortgage Violated Respa and FHA Reporting Requirements,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced an agreement with Prospect Mortgage, LLC (Prospect) to settle allegations the California-based mortgage lender created sham affiliated business arrangements for the purpose of paying improper kickbacks or referral fees in violation of Federal Housing Administration (FHA) guidelines and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA). Prospect agreed to dissolve these sham joint ventures and pay $3.1 million to resolve the complaint.
HUD claimed Prospect operated as a ""series limited liability company,"" a business structure unauthorized by FHA, and that Prospect used this business structure to create hundreds of sham joint ventures with real estate brokers, mortgage brokers, mortgage lenders, servicers and other settlement service providers and to share profits for the referral of real estate settlement services. Through these affiliated business arrangements, Prospect allowed non-approved branch offices to originate FHA-insured mortgages in violation of FHA's guidelines. Read the full text of the agreement announced today.
""The real test for any bona fide affiliate business arrangement is whether the affiliate has sufficient capital and employees to stand on its own two feet,"" said Acting FHA Commissioner Carol Galante. ""In this case, it was clear that these sham companies had neither and were merely sharing profits for the referral of business.""
HUD alleges that Prospect entered into ""series"" or ""subscription agreements"" with real estate brokers, agents, banks, mortgage servicers and others to give the appearance that it was creating legitimate joint ventures to provide real and compensable services. HUD discovered these sham businesses had little or no employees, capital and/or offices; that all core mortgage origination services were performed by Prospect itself; and that Prospect had allowed these affiliated businesses to participate in the origination of FHA-insured loans out of branch offices registered with FHA as exclusive to Prospect. In return for the referral of business, Prospect shared 50 percent of its profits with these entities which HUD determined were not bona fide affiliated businesses, and many of which were not FHA-approved lenders.
RESPA was enacted in 1974 to provide consumers advance disclosures of settlement charges and to prohibit illegal kickbacks and excessive fees in the homebuying process. Section 8(a) of RESPA prohibits a person from giving or accepting anything of value in exchange for the referral of settlement service business and Section 8(b) prohibits unearned fees."
07/13/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-147.cfm,Emergency Homeowners' Loan Program Pre-Application Deadline Approaching,"WASHINGTON - The deadline for homeowners to qualify for the Emergency Homeowners' Loan Program (EHLP) is rapidly approaching with all Pre-Applicant Screening Worksheets due by Friday, July 22, 2011.
The EHLP, launched by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in conjunction with NeighborWorks® America in June, is designed to help homeowners who are at risk of foreclosure in 27 states across the country and Puerto Rico. The program assists homeowners who have experienced a reduction in income and are at risk of foreclosure due to involuntary unemployment or underemployment, due to economic conditions or a medical condition. Under EHLP guidelines eligible homeowners can qualify for an interest free loan which pays a portion of their monthly mortgage for up to two years, or up to $50,000, whichever comes first.
""The Obama Administration and HUD are committed to providing homeowners with a toolbox of options, such as EHLP, to help keep as many American families in their homes as possible,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""It is critical that homeowners get pre-screened to qualify for this program by July 22nd so that they are able to take advantage of EHLP before it's too late.""
The EHLP funds will pay a portion of an approved applicant's monthly mortgage including missed mortgage payments or past due charges including principal, interest, taxes and insurance. EHLP is expected to aid up to 30,000 distressed borrowers, with an average loan of approximately $35,000.
""With July 22nd right around the corner, we want as many people as possible to apply for this program and potentially help save their homes. For that reason it is imperative that homeowners submit their application by July 22nd in order to find out if they qualify,"" stated Eileen M. Fitzgerald, CEO of NeighborWorks® America.
The EHLP funds will be offered in the following states: Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming and Puerto Rico.
Only participating EHLP agencies found on www.FindEHLP.org are approved to accept Pre-Applicant Screening Worksheets. Homeowners should beware of scams. It is free to submit a worksheet or get assistance with completing the worksheet. Any company asking for money to assist homeowners with the EHLP application process is a scam. Contact information for participating agencies, the Pre-Applicant Screening Worksheet and more information on the EHLP assistance and its eligibility requirements can be found at www.FindEHLP.org or by calling toll free at 855-FIND-EHLP (346-3345).

07/14/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-150.cfm,"HUD, VA to Provide Permanent Housing and Support to Thousands of Homeless Vets","WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric K. Shinseki announced today that HUD will provide $46.2 million to public housing agencies in all 50 states and the District of Columbia to supply permanent housing and case management for 6,790 homeless veterans in America.
This funding, from HUD's Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing Program (HUD-VASH), is a coordinated effort by HUD, VA, and local housing agencies to provide permanent housing for homeless veterans. Read a complete local breakdown of the rental vouchers announced today.
""Over the past three years, HUD helped thousands of homeless veterans find a permanent place to call home while VA provided medical treatment, case management and other services to address their specific needs,"" said HUD Secretary Donovan. ""We have no greater mission than to prevent and end homelessness, especially for those brave men and women who risked their lives to protect our nation.""
""This initiative will strengthen our ongoing efforts to eliminate veteran homelessness by 2015 and improve quality of life for veterans,"" said VA Secretary Shinseki. ""Working with our partners at HUD and in Congress, we continue to make good progress to reduce veteran homelessness though much work remains. VA is committed to providing veterans and their families with access to affordable housing and medical services that will help them get back on their feet.""
""This is a great step forward in our effort to get veterans off the streets and into permanent housing,"" said Senator Murray, Chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee. ""Growing up during the Vietnam War, I saw a generation of soldiers left behind because they weren't given the support they needed during their transition home, and I have worked to ensure that veterans today don't face a similar fate. These vouchers will provide critical support to thousands of veterans whose needs went unmet for too long, so that they will finally get the services they need and a permanent place to call home. HUD-VASH vouchers are a key reason why we are making real progress toward goals to finally end veterans homelessness.""
This funding to local housing agencies is part of the Obama Administration's commitment to end Veteran and long-term chronic homelessness by 2015. Opening Doors: Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness (www.usich.gov/PDF/FactSheetVeterans.pdf) serves as a roadmap for how the federal government will work with state and local agreements to confront the root causes of homelessness, especially among former servicemen and women.
The grants announced today are part of $50 million appropriated for Fiscal Year 2011 to support the housing needs of 6,900 homeless veterans. VA Medical Centers (VAMC) provide supportive services and case management to eligible homeless veterans. This is the first of two rounds of the 2011 HUD-VASH funding. HUD expects to announce the remaining funding by the end of this summer.
Homeless veterans are referred to the public housing agencies for these vouchers, based upon a variety of factors, most importantly the need for and willingness to participate in case management. The HUD-VASH program includes both the rental assistance the voucher provides and the comprehensive case management that VAMC staff provides.
Veterans participating in the HUD-VASH program rent privately owned housing and generally contribute no more than 30 percent of their income toward rent. VA offers eligible homeless veterans clinical and supportive services through its medical centers across the U.S., Guam and Puerto Rico."

07/20/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-153.cfm,HUD Charges Wisconsin Property Owners with Discriminating Against Single Mother and Her Son,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is charging James and Julia Norton, a couple who owns rental property in Brown County, Wisconsin, with violating the Fair Housing Act for allegedly establishing different terms for a single mother's tenancy, including requiring her to be at home when her teenage son had visitors. HUD's charge also claims that the Nortons' lease agreement included policies and rules restricting and imposing limitations on families with children.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to refuse to rent to families with children, express a preference or otherwise discriminate or impose different rules and restrictions on families with children.
""Treating families with children differently from other tenants is against the law,"" said John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will continue to take action against property owners who violate the Fair Housing Act by imposing extra burdens on families because they have children.""
According to HUD's charge, shortly after James Norton accepted her deposit and informed the mother that she had been approved for an apartment, he sought to impose an additional requirement that she promise to be present at home when her 17-year-old son had visitors. Unwilling to agree to this new requirement, the mother alleges that she was denied the apartment. HUD's investigation found that around the time the mother and her son had planned to move in, the Nortons rented a unit to two elderly tenants without children.
In addition, HUD alleges that the Nortons published statements in their lease agreements that singled out families with children for burdensome restrictions. For example, the lease stated, ""No children are allowed to play in the common areas of the building,"" and threatened $100 fines and eviction for violations.
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages to aggrieved persons for the damages caused them by the discrimination.
The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief to deter further discrimination, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose fines in order to vindicate the public interest. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages to aggrieved persons.
FHEO and its partners in the Fair Housing Assistance Program investigate more than 10,000 housing discrimination complaints annually. People who believe they are the victims of housing discrimination should contact HUD at 1-800-669-9777 (voice), 800-927-9275 (TTY)."
07/21/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-154.cfm,HUD Charges Owner and Manager of Cincinnati Apartment Complex with Race Discrimination,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is charging the owner and the manager of the 63-unit, Valley Woods Apartments in Cincinnati, OH, with violating the Fair Housing Act for allegedly denying rental opportunities to African Americans. HUD brings the charge on behalf of Housing Opportunities Made Equal (HOME), a non-profit fair housing organization, which filed a complaint with the Department based on the experiences of two African American testers.
According to the charge, HOME conducted two sets of paired tests in response to allegations that Valley Woods Apartments was rapidly changing from being predominantly black to predominantly Hispanic. The first African American tester called three times in four days, and was given different reasons each time for the manager being unable to schedule an appointment to view an apartment. The final time the tester called, the apartment manager allegedly informed him that she was waiting for another applicant to pay the deposit on the only available unit and suggested he call back in a week. In contrast, on the next day when a Hispanic tester called to inquire about an available apartment, the apartment manager allegedly offered to show him the unit that day. The Hispanic tester followed up with two more phone calls, during which the apartment manager provided him with information about the unit and suggested how he could reserve it for himself. The Hispanic tester then scheduled an appointment and was able to tour a two-bedroom apartment.
Two weeks later, the same two-bedroom apartment was still available when a second African American tester called the apartment complex to inquire about available units. The apartment manager returned his call and informed him that the two-bedroom apartment had been rented and that she did not know when any other unit would be available, and advised him to call back in two weeks. According to the Charge, when the second Hispanic tester called the next day, the apartment manager offered to show him the two-bedroom apartment immediately.
""Fair housing testers are specially trained and are critical to uncovering patterns of different treatment by housing providers. An estimated one in five black and Hispanic housing seekers faces different treatment,"" said John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Without paired testing, people may not know they've experienced discrimination.""
The HUD charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages to HOME aggrieved for the damages caused it by the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief to deter further discrimination, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose fines in order to vindicate the public interest. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages to aggrieved persons.

The FIRST Program provides training and technical guidance to help architects and builders comply with the accessibility requirements of the Fair Housing Act. The Fair Housing Act requires certain features of accessible design in all residential buildings with four or more units built after March 13, 1991, including, for example, an accessible route, wider doors, and kitchens and bathrooms that are usable for a wheelchair user.
""Having housing that is accessible makes a real day-to-day difference to people with disabilities,"" said John Trasviña, Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""We offer training geared to architects and builders, but open to all, for greater legal compliance and living standards.""
HUD's Fair Housing Accessibility FIRST Program will kick off the first of at least 10 training events across the country starting at the Mississippi Housing Conference on August 22, 2011. This training will take place at the Lake Terrace Convention Center in Hattiesburg, Mississippi and will include an overview of design and construction requirements and other resources to help local communities and developers comply with the Fair Housing Act. To read more about this training and how to register, go to the Fair Housing Accessibility FIRST Website (www.fairhousingfirst.org/).
Launched in 2003, HUD's Fair Housing Accessibility FIRST program is a HUD-funded program that promotes compliance with the Fair Housing Act's accessible design and construction requirements.

07/28/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-160.cfm,HUD Secretary Announces Availability of $95 Million from Sustainable Communities Grant Programs,"WASHINGTON - Today, U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan announced the availability of $95 million to support sustainable local initiatives through the FY 2011 Regional Planning and Community Challenge Planning Grant Programs from HUD's Office of Sustainable Housing and Communities. Awarded competitively, both programs work to expand housing choices, improve connections between employment centers and homes, and reduce barriers to achieving affordable, economically vital, and sustainable communities.
""This funding renews an important commitment the Obama Administration made to American families with the announcement of the Administration's Partnership for Sustainable Communities in 2009,"" said Donovan. ""Connecting affordable housing choices with quality schools and jobs not only ensures families will be able to provide a safe environment for their children, but it also provides communities large and small with the resources they need to make a sustainable plan for their future.""
This year's Regional Planning Grant program will encourage grantees to support regional planning efforts that integrate housing, land-use, economic and workforce development, transportation, and infrastructure developments in a manner that empowers regions to consider how all of these factors work together to bring economic competitiveness and revitalization to a community. The program will place a priority on partnerships, including the collaboration of arts and culture, philanthropy, and innovative ideas to the regional planning process. Recognizing that areas are in different stages of sustainability planning, HUD will establish two funding categories for the Sustainable Communities Regional Planning Grant program.
Group 1 Funds: Can be used to support the preparation of Regional Plans for sustainable development. Group 2 Funds: Can be used to support efforts to modify existing regional plans so that they are in accordance with the Partnership for Sustainable Communities' six Livability Principles. Category 2 Funds also may be used to prepare more detailed execution plans for an adopted regional plan for sustainable development and limit predevelopment planning activities for catalytic projects.
• Group 1 Funds: Can be used to support the preparation of Regional Plans for sustainable development.

Category 2 Funds also may be used to prepare more detailed execution plans for an adopted regional plan for sustainable development and limit predevelopment planning activities for catalytic projects.
The Community Challenge Planning grant program will be competitively awarded to state, local and tribal governments for efforts such as amending or replacing local master plans, zoning and building codes to promote mixed-use development, building more affordable housing, and the rehabilitation of older buildings and structures with the goal of promoting sustainability at the local and neighborhood levels. In addition, this year's grant program will set aside $3 million for jurisdictions with populations under 50,000, and reward high scoring applicants with Preferred Sustainability Status (PSS), which will qualify them for several benefits, including access to capacity building resources and potential points in a number of funding opportunities managed by HUD
Both programs, now in their second year build on the Partnership for Sustainable Communities, an innovative interagency collaboration, launched by President Obama in June 2009, between HUD, the Department of Transportation (DOT) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to provide more sustainable housing and transportation choices for families and lay the foundation for a 21st century economy. Guided by six Livability Principles, the Partnership is designed to remove the traditional silos that exist between federal departments and strategically target the agencies' transportation, land use, environmental, housing and community development resources to provide communities the resources they need to build more livable, sustainable communities. Last month the Partnership marked its second anniversary through a website, www.sustainablecommunities.gov, which provides a one-stop shop for best practices, grant announcement and accomplishments of the Partnership. This year's grant awardees will join more than 80 communities around the country that have already used sustainable communities funding to plan their region's future. To read the full text of HUD's advance funding announcement, visit HUD's Sustainability website. Community Challenge Planning grant program applications are due September 9, 2011, and the pre-applications for the Regional Planning Grant Program are due August 25, 2011.
The Partnership's interagency collaboration gets better results for communities and uses taxpayer money more efficiently by coordinating federal investments in infrastructure, facilities, and services that meet multiple economic, environmental, and community objectives with each dollar spent. The Partnership is helping communities across the country to create more housing choices, make transportation more efficient and reliable, reinforce existing investments, and support vibrant and healthy neighborhoods that attract businesses. At a time when every dollar the federal government invests in jumpstarting the economy is critical, the President's plan ensures that all these agencies are coordinating efforts and targeting resources with precision. Community Planning Challenge grants will reinforce the principles of the Partnership, and provide the grantees with the necessary tools to build economic competitiveness in their regions."

MRB sanctions against lenders include reprimands, probations, suspensions, withdrawals of approval, and civil money penalties. Read the full text of MRB's Federal Register Notice (www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2011-07-29/pdf/2011-19293.pdf)
""It's never been more important that lenders doing business with FHA apply our standards to each and every loan they originate and underwrite,"" said Acting FHA Commissioner Carol Galante. ""FHA requirements ensure homeowners are put on a path of sustainable homeownership and that ultimately helps stabilize entire neighborhoods and communities.""
Since 2009, the MRB took more than 2,300 administrative actions against lenders, including a record 1,600 last year alone. Meanwhile, FHA instituted a number of new rules designed to strengthen risk management including increasing net worth requirements of FHA-approved lenders, strengthening lender approval criteria, and making lenders liable for the oversight of mortgage brokers.
FHA's Mortgagee Review Board sanctions FHA-approved lenders for violations of the agency's program requirements. For serious violations, the Board can withdraw a lender's FHA approval so that the lender cannot participate in FHA programs. In less serious cases, the Board enters into settlement agreements with lenders to bring them into compliance. The Board can also impose civil money penalties, probation, suspension, and issue letters of reprimand. The MRB publishes these actions after all appeals are exhausted and final determinations can be announced publicly. For a full listing of the actions taken by the Board, visit HUD's website."
08/01/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-164.cfm,HUD Charges Pennsylvania Landlord with Discriminating Against Families with Children,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has charged the owner and manager of Breckenridge Plaza Apartments in Phoenixville, PA, with violating the Fair Housing Act by discriminating against families with children. Breckenridge Plaza, Inc., and Morris Zelikovsky were charged with making discriminatory statements, including in advertisements on craigslist.org, indicating a preference against families with children, offering different rental terms and conditions to families with children, and discouraging families with children from applying for housing.
HUD brings the charge on behalf of the Fair Housing Council of Suburban Philadelphia (FHCSP), a non-profit fair housing organization, which filed a complaint with HUD after FHCSP testers determined that manager Zelikovsky treated same-size households differently by imposing different rental charges when one member of a family was a child. One of the ads placed by Zelikovsky stated: ""Winter Special Price for Two Adults."" The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to make statements that express a preference or otherwise discriminate and to impose different rules and restrictions on families with children.
""Charging higher rent to a family because they have children unjustly saddles them with an extra financial burden and violates the Fair Housing Act,"" said John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will continue to take swift action against owners and landlords who impose different terms and conditions on families with children.""
According to HUD's charge, after FHCSP noticed ads on craigslist.org and in the local newspaper, The Phoenix, indicating that families with children were being charged higher rents than same-size households without children, FHCSP conducted several rental tests. Zelikovsky told a FHCSP tester posing as a mother with a son that she would have to pay $775 for a two-bedroom apartment that had been advertised as renting for $740. Later that same day, Zelikovsky told a different tester posing as a married woman with no children that a two-bedroom apartment rented for $745 a month.
During a different test conducted by FHCSP, Zelikovsky told a tester posing as a married woman with no children that a two-bedroom apartment was $740 a month. Later that day, a tester posing as a mother with a child contacted Zelikovsky about a two-bedroom apartment. When the tester asked Zelikovsky if having a child was going to be a problem, he allegedly said, ""It's just going to be higher at $775 a month.""
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages to aggrieved persons for the damages caused them by the discrimination.
The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief to deter further discrimination, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose fines in order to vindicate the public interest. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages to aggrieved persons.

08/05/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-165.cfm,Obama Administration Releases July Housing Scorecard,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of the Treasury today released the July edition of the Obama Administration's Housing Scorecard - a comprehensive report on the nation's housing market. The latest housing data offer continued mixed signals as home prices improved slightly but showed continued strain from foreclosures and distressed homes. Also, as more homeowners secure mortgage relief, fewer borrowers entered the foreclosure pipeline in June. The full report is available online at www.hud.gov/scorecard.
""This month's housing data paint a mixed picture of conditions in the market - despite growing evidence of progress in the broader economy,"" said HUD Assistant Secretary Raphael Bostic. ""We're continuing to see a slight improvement in home prices and a decline in mortgage defaults as our foreclosure prevention programs reach more borrowers upstream in the process. But we have much more work to do to help the market recover and to reach the many households there and across the nation who still face trouble.""
""Tens of thousands of additional homeowners are getting real relief from the Administration's programs every month,"" said Treasury Assistant Secretary for Financial Stability Tim Massad. ""These programs are setting standards across the industry that are yielding more sustainable assistance for homeowners in the face of the worst housing crisis in a generation.""
The July Housing Scorecard features key data on the health of the housing market and the impact of the Administration's foreclosure prevention programs, including:
Fewer homeowners fell behind on their mortgages during the month of June. In June, 4.4 percent of prime mortgages were at least 30 days late - a significant decline from the peak of 5.9 percent seen in 2010. Moreover, seriously delinquent prime mortgages - those at least 90 days late or in foreclosure - remained approximately 22 percent below a high of 1.9 million recorded last year. As new delinquencies decrease across the nation, the number of new homeowners seeking assistance through the Administration's programs may also decrease. The Administration's recovery efforts have helped millions of families deal with the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. Nearly 5 million modification arrangements were started between April 2009 and the end of May 2011.This includes more than 1.6 million HAMP trial modification starts, more than 938,000 FHA loss mitigation and early delinquency interventions, and nearly 2.4 million HOPE Now proprietary modifications, reflecting the reach of standards developed in the Administration's programs. While some homeowners may have received help from more than one program, the total number of agreements offered continues to more than double the number of foreclosure completions for the same period (2.1 million). In June, nearly 32,000 additional homeowners received a permanent modification through the Administration's Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP); more than 760,000 homeowners across the country have received a HAMP permanent modification to date with a median payment reduction of 37 percent. Even as new delinquencies continue to fall, eligible homeowners entering HAMP have a high likelihood of earning a permanent modification and realizing long-term success. The rate of modifications moving from trial to permanent is up to 74 percent, and the average time to convert from a trial to permanent modification is down to 3.5 months. Homeowners in HAMP modifications continue to perform well over time, with re-default rates lower than those on industry modifications. At one year, more than 84 percent of homeowners remain in their HAMP permanent modification.

The Riverside metropolitan statistical area (MSA) was among the nation's hardest hit areas following the housing market downturn and a region where the Administration's broad approach to stabilizing the housing market has been very active.
""Our Regional Spotlight shows that after years of rapidly rising home prices fueled in part by widely available - but ultimately unsustainable - adjustable rate mortgages, Riverside neighborhoods suffered a steep drop in property values and many severely underwater mortgages,"" added Bostic. ""However, we also show how the Administration's approach to stabilizing the housing market has been a source of real help to local families - helping more than 131,000 homeowners to avoid foreclosure.""
The Housing Scorecard Regional Spotlight features data on the health of the Riverside housing market and impact of efforts to help homeowners at the local level including:
The Administration's mortgage assistance programs have helped tens of thousands of Riverside families avoid foreclosure. Through May 2011, approximately 131,000 mortgage assistance interventions have been offered to homeowners in the Riverside metropolitan area, including more than 75,500 interventions offered through HAMP and FHA loss mitigation and early delinquency intervention programs. An estimated 56,000 additional proprietary modifications have been offered through Hope Now Alliance servicers. While some homeowners may have received help from more than one program, the number of times assistance has been offered in the Riverside MSA is two-thirds higher than the number of foreclosures completed during this period (80,000). Riverside homeowners are starting to see relief after struggling with some of the highest levels of mortgage delinquency and foreclosure in the nation. The share of area mortgages 90 or more days delinquent dropped from 17 percent to 12 percent over the past year - an improvement over the national decline of 1 percent over the same period. Completed foreclosures also declined from 9,400 in the first quarter of 2010 to 7,600 in the first quarter of 2011, although lender process reviews continue to affect foreclosure completions locally and nationally. However, many homeowners and loans remain at risk as nearly half of all mortgages in the Riverside area (47 percent) are in negative equity - more than twice the national rate (23 percent). The Administration's Hardest Hit Fund and Neighborhood Stabilization Programs have fueled local foreclosure prevention efforts and market stability. California has received nearly $2 billion through the Hardest Hit Fund to implement local solutions to borrower mortgage defaults and address the range of factors that contribute to a family's financial problems. Moreover, approximately $191 million has been awarded to sixteen jurisdictions through the Neighborhood Stabilization Program to help purchase or redevelop residential properties and address the effects of abandoned and foreclosed housing. Both programs have helped provide stability to the Riverside housing market.

08/10/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-166.cfm,HUD Unveils New Web-Based Mapping Tool to Display Nearly Half of U.S. Foreclosed Properties,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today launched a new web-based mapping tool displaying the location of all foreclosed properties held by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). These foreclosed homes collectively account for nearly half of all real estate-owned or REO properties in the U.S. HUD's REO Portal is intended to help local communities, homebuyers and responsible investors to acquire these properties and accelerate efforts to stabilize local housing markets.
This new mapping tool will be of particular help to those communities employing HUD's Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) in the targeted acquisition, rehabilitation and/or demolition of these REO properties. The REO Portal's consolidated graphic listing includes properties held by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). The tool enables users to search a specific address or neighborhood, as well as estimated delinquency counts based on HUD analysis for local NSP program activities.
""In this case, a picture is worth more than a thousand words,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""This new mapping tool gives local communities a much clearer picture of where these foreclosed properties are so they can focus their energies in especially hard-hit neighborhoods.""
""HUD's REO Portal gives prospective homebuyers and local community development organizations a comprehensive view of housing opportunities in their desired neighborhood,"" said Ed Neill, Senior Vice President of Credit Loss Management at Fannie Mae. ""The REO Portal supports Fannie Mae's ongoing commitment to stabilizing neighborhoods by allowing buyers to search through a vast selection of houses and find one they can call their home.""
Anthony Renzi, executive vice president of single family business and information technology at Freddie Mac added, ""The HUD REO Portal gives buyers a terrific new tool for comparison shopping affordable homes, including Freddie Mac's HomeSteps homes, in the neighborhood of their choice. I want to thank Secretary Donovan for giving Freddie Mac the opportunity to help develop the REO Portal, which underscores our mission to foster stable communities and support the nation's housing markets.""
In partnership with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, FHA, and the Federal Housing Finance Agency, HUD's Office of Policy Development and Research developed this REO web portal allowing users to map available REO properties in their local community. In addition to mapping individual properties, the portal provides consolidated listing for user-defined neighborhoods with details such as list date, price, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and links to Homepath (Fannie Mae), Homesteps (Freddie Mac), and HUD Homestore (FHA) to connect potential buyers to the acquisition process. The REO Portal supports more efficient disposition of REO properties to support the stabilization of neighborhoods and recovery of local housing markets by enabling a neighborhood-focused, strategic approach to acquisition."
08/10/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-167.cfm,"FHFA, Treasury, HUD Seek Input on Disposition of Real Estate Owned Properties","WASHINGTON - The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), in consultation with the U.S. Department of the Treasury and Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), has announced a Request For Information (RFI), seeking input on new options for selling single-family real estate owned (REO) properties held by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the Enterprises), and the Federal Housing Administration (FHA).
The RFI's objective is to help address current and future REO inventory. It will explore alternatives for maximizing value to taxpayers and increasing private investment in the housing market, including approaches that support rental and affordable housing needs.
""While the Enterprises will continue to market individual REO properties for sale, FHFA and the Enterprises seek input on possible pooling of REO properties in situations where such pooling, combined with private management, may reduce Enterprise credit losses and help stabilize neighborhoods and home values,"" said FHFA Acting Director Edward J. DeMarco. ""Partnerships involving Enterprise properties may reduce taxpayer losses and meet the Enterprises' responsibility to bring stability and liquidity to housing markets. We seek input on these important questions.""
""As we continue moving forward on housing finance reform, it's critical that we support the process of repair and recovery in the housing market,"" said Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner. ""Exploring new options for selling these foreclosed properties will help expand access to affordable rental housing, promote private investment in local housing markets, and support neighborhood and home price stability.""
""Millions of families nationwide have seen their home values impacted as their neighbors' homes fall into foreclosure or become abandoned,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""At the same time, with half of all renters spending more than a third of their income on housing and a quarter spending more than half, we have to find and promote new ways to alleviate the strain on the affordable rental market. Taking steps to encourage private investment in REO properties and transition them into productive use will help stabilize neighborhoods and home values at a critical time for our economy.""
The RFI calls for approaches that achieve the following objectives:
reduce the REO portfolios of the Enterprises and FHA in a cost-effective manner; reduce average loan loss severities to the Enterprises and FHA relative to individual distressed property sales; address property repair and rehabilitation needs; respond to economic and real estate conditions in specific geographies; assist in neighborhood and home price stabilization efforts; and suggest analytic approaches to determine the appropriate disposition strategy for individual properties, whether sale, rental, or, in certain instances, demolition. FHFA, Treasury and HUD anticipate respondents may best address these objectives through REO to rental structures, but respondents are encouraged to propose strategies they believe best accomplish the RFI's objectives. Proposed strategies, transactions, and venture structures may also include: programs for previous homeowners to rent properties or for current renters to become owners (""lease-to-own""); strategies through which REO assets could be used to support markets with a strong demand for rental units and a substantial volume of REO; a mechanism for private owners of REO inventory to eventually participate in the transactions; and support for affordable housing.

08/16/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-168.cfm,"HUD Announces Unprecedented Assistance for Alabama, Missouri Storm Victims","WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan announced today that HUD will provide assistance to families affected by this spring's catastrophic tornadoes in Joplin, MO, and central Alabama, by entering into an unprecedented purchase agreement to sell real estate owned properties (REO) to public housing authorities in the affected areas.
As part of a pilot program, HUD will sell nearly 90 ""move-in ready"" REO properties in both Missouri and Alabama to public housing authorities at a discount in an effort to quickly provide housing for families that were displaced by the tornadoes. The public housing authority will then make the properties available for lease or sale to any impacted person within two months.
""After witnessing first-hand the size and scope of the devastation in Alabama, I knew we must do more,"" said Donovan. ""For the first-time, HUD has designed a pilot program that will bring families affected by a significant disaster closer to stability by quickly providing them with an opportunity to purchase or lease a home. We hope to be able to use this draft purchase agreement as a model to assist other families displaced after a disaster.""
Nearly 90 REO properties in both Alabama and Missouri are available as part of the draft purchase agreement. Due to the proximity of Joplin, MO, to neighboring states, HUD is offering REO properties within a 20-mile radius of the city limits. The REO properties are available in the following counties:
Alabama: Autauga, Calhoun, Elmore, Jefferson, Limestone, Madison, Marion, Marshall and Tallapoosa Kansas: Cherokee Missouri: Jasper and Newton Oklahoma: Ottawa
• Alabama: Autauga, Calhoun, Elmore, Jefferson, Limestone, Madison, Marion, Marshall and Tallapoosa
• Kansas: Cherokee
• Missouri: Jasper and Newton
• Oklahoma: Ottawa
To date, HUD has provided $350,000 each to Birmingham and Tuscaloosa, AL, and Joplin, MO, through the Community Development Block Grant Sanctions Fund, which helps communities to address their long-term recovery needs following the impacts of recent disasters.
Individuals interested in purchasing one of these properties may contact their local public housing authority for information on how to apply. A list of public housing authorities can be found on HUD's website."
08/17/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-169.cfm,HUD and EPA Announce Awardees in a Historic Collaborative Effort to Invest in Sustainable Communities,"WASHINGTON - In an historic collaborative effort to assure the success of previous federal investments, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) today competitively awarded $5.65 million to eight organizations to help existing federal grantees work together to solve common problems. These organizations will form capacity-building networks among the grantees to exchange ideas on successful strategies, lessons learned, emerging tools, and public engagement plans. This work will strengthen the capacity grantee communities to create more housing choices, make transportation more efficient and reliable, make more efficient investments in water and wastewater infrastructure, and build vibrant, healthy and economically prosperous neighborhoods for American families.
Each award will go to a team or teams of organizations with the collective expertise and experience to build the capacity of sustainable communities grantees in six outcome areas. The lead organization or organizations for each outcome area is below:
The Institute for Sustainable Communities (Montpelier, VT) will create a National Sustainability Learning Network; The University of Louisville Research Foundation, Inc. (Louisville, KY) will address the need for incorporating water infrastructure planning and investments with other planning efforts; The Coalition for Utah's Future/Project 2000 (Salt Lake City, UT) will work to build skills in Scenario Planning techniques and tools; Reconnecting America (Washington, DC) will develop effective implementation strategies for economic development and local and regional plans; PolicyLink (Oakland, CA) and Place Matters, Inc. (Denver, CO) will work with communities to advance social equity in planning, participation, and decision making; and The NADO Research Foundation (Washington, DC) and the Minnesota Housing Partnership (St. Paul, MN) will target their efforts in strengthening sustainability practices for tribes, small towns, and rural places.

• The NADO Research Foundation (Washington, DC) and the Minnesota Housing Partnership (St. Paul, MN) will target their efforts in strengthening sustainability practices for tribes, small towns, and rural places.
The awards build upon the work of the Partnership for Sustainable Communities, an innovative interagency collaboration, launched by President Obama in June 2009, between HUD, EPA and the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) to lay the foundation for a 21st century economy by creating more financially, environmentally and socially sustainable communities. Award recipients will form a national leadership network of existing and future HUD and EPA grantees that are advancing sustainable local and regional planning and development in their respective areas. The Capacity Building for Sustainable Communities grant program will award funds to capacity building service providers who will work directly with grant recipients from the FY2010, and FY 2011 HUD Sustainable Communities Regional Planning and Community Challenge, HUD Preferred Sustainability Status Communities, and EPA Brownfield Area Wide Planning grant programs and technical assistance from EPA's office of Sustainable Communities.
The Partnership's interagency collaboration gets better results for communities and uses taxpayer money more efficiently by coordinating federal investments in infrastructure, facilities, and services that meet multiple economic, environmental, and community objectives with each dollar spent. The Partnership is helping communities across the country to create more housing choices, make transportation more efficient and reliable, reinforce existing investments, and support vibrant and healthy neighborhoods that attract businesses. At a time when every dollar the federal government invests in jumpstarting the economy is critical, the President's plan ensures that all these agencies are coordinating efforts and aligning resources. This grant program will reinforce the principles of the Partnership, and provide the grantees with the necessary tools to build economic competitiveness in their regions.
HUD took the lead in administering the notice of funding availability (NOFA) while both agencies collaborated in the review and selection process. The awardees demonstrated significant knowledge, skills, experience, and a cohesive plan for delivering the specific skills and tactics necessary to build the capacity of existing sustainability grantees. Both HUD and EPA contributed funding to the grant opportunity."
08/19/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-170.cfm,FHA Announces New Loan Limits to take Effect October 1st,"WASHINGTON - On October 1, 2011, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) will implement new single-family loan limits as specified by the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA). As a result, FHA will reduce loan limits in the highest cost metropolitan areas of the country while limits would remain unchanged in most other parts of the nation. Read FHA's mortgagee letter detailing the agency's new loan limits.
These new loan limits were scheduled to take effect in January of 2009 but continuing strains in credit markets led the Congress to delay implementation. The result has been nearly three years of higher loan limits for some areas based on the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 (ESA).
Forward Mortgages
Barring any new action by the Congress, many affected areas will have lower FHA loan limits on October 1, 2011. The current standard (floor) loan limit for areas where housing costs are relatively low will remain unchanged at $271,050 for one-unit properties. The new ""ceiling"" loan limit for higher cost areas will be reduced from $729,750 to $625,500 for one-unit properties. FHA loan limits vary based on area median home price, but all will fall within the range of $271,050 and $625,500 for one unit properties. Additional information and loan limits for two-, three-, and four-unit properties are noted in FHA's mortgagee letter. As in previous years, Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, and the Virgin Islands may have higher loan limits.
FHA estimates that only a fraction of borrowers living in the nation's highest cost areas will be impacted by the new loan limits announced today. For example, last year only three percent of FHA-insured borrowers lived in these high-cost areas.
The change in FHA loan limits will affect 669 counties across the country, out of a total of 3,234 jurisdictions in which FHA insures home loans. Most loan applications with an FHA case number assigned on or after October 1, 2011, will be subject to the new limits. However, there are some exceptions for FHA-insured to FHA-insured refinances that are noted in HUD's Mortgagee Letter. In addition, there are exceptions for loans that were issued case numbers on or before 9/30/11 and meet all of the credit approval criteria detailed in Mortgagee Letter 2011 -29.
Home Equity Conversion Mortgages
The mortgage loan limit and maximum claim amount for FHA-insured reverse mortgages will remain unchanged. The FHA product known as the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) will continue to have a maximum claim amount of $625,500.
Reverse mortgages allow homeowners age 62 and older to borrow against the value of their homes without selling them. Homeowners can select a lump-sum payment, monthly payments or tap into a line of credit. No repayment is required as long as a homeowner lives in a home with a reverse mortgage. The reverse mortgage is repaid, with interest, when a homeowner sells the home or dies.

08/22/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-171.cfm,"HUD Announces New Strong Cities, Strong Communities Fellowship Program","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today published a notice seeking a qualified partner to help launch, and then manage, a pilot fellowship program to support the Administration's Strong Cities, Strong Communities Initiative. Initially funded through a $2.5 million donation from the Rockefeller Foundation, HUD's partner will select, train, and place public service-minded 'social innovators' to serve multi-year terms in local government positions to help stimulate economic development and employment.
HUD's Request for Qualifications broadly considers a qualified partner to be an educational institution, private and for-profit entity, or private or public nonprofit organization. A partnership can be comprised of two or more of these entities. Read the full text of HUD's notice at www.ofr.gov/.
""Today, we take an important first step in the development of a fellowship program that will help local communities reignite their economies,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""Ultimately, highly skilled and motivated fellows will be deployed into six cities where they will roll up their sleeves and work shoulder-to-shoulder with local leaders in a broader effort to spark economic growth.""
""The Rockefeller Foundation looks forward to the lasting impact we know this effort will achieve. HUD's fellowship program will bring the innovators and innovations we need in public service. We think the Strong Cities, Sustainable Communities initiative will help build long-term economic resilience to the kinds of daunting challenges communities have faced in the last few years,"" said Peter Madonia, Chief Operating Officer of the Rockefeller Foundation.
Strong Cities, Strong Communities (SC2) is a new and customized pilot initiative to strengthen local capacity and spark economic growth in local communities, while ensuring taxpayer dollars are used wisely and efficiently. To accomplish this, federal agencies will provide experienced staff to work directly with six cities: Chester, Pennsylvania; Cleveland; Detroit; Fresno, California; Memphis, Tennessee; and New Orleans. HUD hopes that approximately 30 competitively selected fellows will work with local governments, the private sector, and other institutions to leverage federal dollars and support the work being done at the local level to encourage economic growth community development.
Additionally, as part of the SC2 initiative and under the U.S. Department of Commerce, communities nationwide will be eligible to compete for a comprehensive economic planning assistance through a grant competition designed to spark local innovation. By integrating government investments and partnering with local communities, SC2 channels the resources of the federal government to help empower cities as they develop and implement their vision for economic growth.
As part of its ongoing effort to cultivate philanthropic involvement in this initiative, HUD will seek further support from other foundations to amplify the impact of this fellowship pilot program in the six SC2 cities.
The Fellowship Placement Pilot Program is modeled after a successful program from the University of Pennsylvania's Center for Urban Redevelopment Excellence (CUREx), which placed young professionals in redevelopment agencies across the nation for two-year stints to support the long-term objectives of their host organizations. Fellows were trained and later integrated into their host organizations where they managed and completed large-scale redevelopment projects. The success of the program led to the development of the Rockefeller Foundation Redevelopment Fellowship, a similar engagement that focused its efforts on improving the conditions for the city of New Orleans."
08/22/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-172.cfm,FHA Multifamily Loan Volume Sets New Record,"WASHINGTON - Never in the history of the Federal Housing Administration has there been such demand for FHA-insured financing to build, rehabilitate or refinance multifamily apartment properties. FHA today announced that it has endorsed $10.5 billion in multifamily rental housing loans since last October, with another month-and-a-half remaining in the fiscal year.
So far this fiscal year, FHA has endorsed nearly 1,100 multifamily loans, more than seven times the number of loans the agency endorsed just three years ago. This historic loan activity also breaks the $10 billion threshold for only the second time in FHA's history of endorsing multifamily loans. To help meet this growing demand, FHA today published updated underwriting and program guidance to help accelerate and coordinate the processing of new loan applications.
""FHA has never been more relevant in making sure the multifamily apartment marketplace continues to function even during these tough economic times,"" said Carol Galante, FHA's acting commissioner. ""While we're seeing record volume, we also recognize we have to accelerate the time it takes us to process these applications so we continue to meet this demand at the very time the market needs us the most.""
Meanwhile, FHA today published its revised Multifamily Accelerated Processing (MAP) Guide which is intended to cut the time required to approve loan applications and to assure consistent application of program requirements and credit standards across all HUD processing offices. FHA's new MAP Guide delegates more underwriting responsibility to approved ""MAP lenders"" and includes all relevant guidance published by FHA since the MAP Guide was last updated in 2002. This new Guide consolidates all necessary underwriting and program requirements in one document and addresses concerns raised by those seeking updated standards.
Earlier this year, FHA issued new multifamily loan closing documents which had not been updated in 40 years. The loan documents required updating to ensure that they would be consistent with modern real estate and lending practices. The new MAP Guide is fully coordinated with the new loan closing documents."
08/23/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-173.cfm,HUD Awards More Than $28 Million in Grants to Promote Affordable Housing and Economic Development in Rural Communities,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today awarded more than $28 million to 46 rural and tribal communities throughout the nation to address distressed housing conditions and concentrated poverty. HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan said the grants from HUD's new Rural Innovation Fund promote an 'entrepreneurial approach' to affordable housing and economic development in rural areas (see list of grants by the state of their service area below).
""Rural America is vast and diverse, and different communities face different challenges and opportunities,"" said Donovan. ""Because there is no 'one-size-fits-all' approach to strengthening rural communities, this funding provides flexible resources to address either housing or economic development needs, or both. This is especially important for communities that may have more limited access to resources because of their distant locations. These are catalytic projects that will have an impact on their communities for generations to come.""
For example, the Atmautluak Traditional Council in Alaska will train a construction workforce in green, energy-efficient new construction. Habitat for Humanity Lake County in California will repair and renovate 30 homes as part of its Jobs-for-Homes Project and hire local workers in the process. The Midwest Minnesota Community Development Corporation in Minnesota will provide business financing to redevelop an abandoned commercial facility for the production of biomass heating pellets, capitalizing on the area's supply of wood and logging residue, and linking in low-skilled area workers in the process. The Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians in Wisconsin will create a visitors center to promote tribal businesses and provide a venue for the work of local crafts and tradespersons.
HUD's new Rural Innovation Fund offers grants of up to $2 million to support innovative housing and economic development activities in 19 states throughout the country. HUD received 307 applications from 48 states for over $236 million, almost 10 times the amount available. Eligible applicants were federally recognized Indian tribes, state housing finance agencies (HFAs), state community development agencies, local rural non-profit organizations, community development corporations, or consortia of these groups. Grantees can use their grant funding to support a variety of housing and economic development activities including construction, preparation of plans, land acquisition, demolition, homeownership counseling, and financial assistance.
HUD awarded Rural Innovation Fund grants in three categories:
Comprehensive Grants - 7 Comprehensive grants, in which grantees have examined the social, housing and economic needs and resources of their target areas and made proposals that address these needs through activities that will have sustained benefit and resources after HUD assistance is used. The maximum grant amount was $2,000,000 for this category. Single Purpose Grants - 31 Single Purpose grants, for more targeted initiatives, which typically focus primarily on either housing or economic development. The maximum award amount was $300,000 for this category. Economic Development and Entrepreneurship for Federally Recognized Tribes - 8 Indian Economic Development and Entrepreneurship grants, awarded from $5 million set aside for applications for federally recognized Indian tribes. The maximum award amount was $800,000 for this category.

08/24/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-175.cfm,HUD Charges New York Co-Op and Two of its Employees with Discriminating Against Tenant with Disabilities,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is charging RiverBay Corporation, a housing cooperative located in the Bronx, and two of its employees with violating the Fair Housing Act for denying a disabled man's reasonable accommodation request. HUD brings the charge on behalf of the disabled tenant, claiming that RiverBay refused to allow the tenant to have a medically prescribed emotional support animal and that the cooperative's security officers harassed the tenant because of the service animal.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful for a housing provider to refuse to make a reasonable accommodation in its rules, policies, practices, or services when needed to provide persons with disabilities an equal opportunity to use or enjoy a dwelling. It is also illegal to intimidate, threaten or interfere with any person for exercising their fair housing rights.
""Housing providers have a legal obligation to grant people with disabilities reasonable accommodations,"" said John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD is committed to ensuring that tenants with disabilities have what they need to live comfortably.""
According to the charge, when the tenant first moved into the Co-op, he signed an occupancy agreement that had a ""no pets"" provision. A number of years later, the tenant requested a reasonable accommodation to the Co-op's ""no pets"" policy so that he could keep a service animal his doctor had prescribed to assist with his daily living. The tenant had letters from his doctor and the City of New York's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene verifying the animal's service status and the tenant's need to retain his service dog. Still, RiverBay allegedly denied the tenant's request for an accommodation, stating that there was no evidence to show his disability required a support animal. RiverBay then refused to accept the tenant's rent payments, threatened to suspend his garage privileges, and attempted to evict him from his apartment. Eventually, RiverBay stopped trying to evict the tenant, but continued to deny his request for a reasonable accommodation.
HUD's charge further alleges that the Co-op's security director failed to ensure that the security officers he supervised did not harass the tenant and his wife for keeping the service animal, even though the tenant specifically asked him to do so.
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages to aggrieved persons for the damages caused them by the discrimination.
The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief to deter further discrimination, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose fines in order to vindicate the public interest. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages to aggrieved persons."

08/29/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-177.cfm,HUD and Neighborworks® America Accepting Additional Applications for Emergency Homeowners' Loan Program,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and NeighborWorks® America today reopened the application process for the Emergency Homeowners' Loan Program (EHLP) (http://findehlp.org/) in 27 states and Puerto Rico to give homeowners at risk of foreclosure more time to apply for the program. While the original application deadline was July 27, HUD estimates that resources will be available to reach more struggling homeowners and will accept applications submitted through September 15, 2011.
Additional applications for this emergency bridge loan program will be accepted in the following states: Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
EHLP will assist homeowners in these states who have experienced a reduction in income and are at risk of foreclosure due to involuntary unemployment or underemployment, due to economic conditions or a medical condition. Eligible homeowners can qualify for an interest-free loan, which pays a portion of their monthly mortgage for up to two years, or up to $50,000, whichever comes first.
Homeowners are encouraged to visit www.FindEHLP.org to find contact information for all participating counseling agencies, to access the Applicant Screening Worksheet, the required Documents for All Applicants Checklist and more information on the EHLP assistance and its eligibility requirements. Homeowners may also call the toll free hotline, (855) FIND-EHLP (346-3345).
In addition, Homeowners must contact a participating counseling agency for more information in order to determine their eligibility for the program and to apply for mortgage assistance. Only participating counseling agencies can accept applications from homeowners.
Since EHLP funds are provided to qualified homeowners on a first-come, first-served basis, it is critical homeowners provide all required documents in a timely manner or risk losing the opportunity to apply for assistance under the program. There is no cost to apply for this program.
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act authorizes HUD to administer a $1 billion Emergency Homeowners Loan Program nationwide. EHLP provides up to 24 months of assistance to homeowners who have experienced a substantial reduction in income due to involuntary unemployment, underemployment, or a medical condition and are at-risk of foreclosure. Qualified families can receive a zero-percent loan to help them pay their mortgage. This emergency bridge loan will gradually be forgiven provided the homeowner remains in their property for five years.
HUD is aggressively promoting this emergency mortgage assistance program to nearly 80,000 homeowners in these 27 states and Puerto Rico with mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and who are at least 90-days delinquent on their loan payments.

08/29/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-179.cfm,Fair Housing Report Demonstrates HUD's Efforts to End Housing Discrimination,"WASHINGTON - A report released today by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) shows that the agency is resolving individual housing discrimination complaints faster, increasing its focus on complaints that affect multiple people, and launching more investigations using its authority to initiate cases on behalf of discrimination victims where no one has filed a complaint. HUD's Annual State of Fair Housing Report also illustrates how the agency is helping municipalities and state and local agencies receiving HUD funding to comply with civil rights requirements and holding non-compliant recipients accountable.
""Our goal is to put an end to unlawful housing discrimination,"" said John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""We have made progress in reducing housing discrimination, but more work needs to be done to make 'fair housing…part of the American way of life,' as President Johnson said in 1968 when he signed the Fair Housing Act into law.""
More than 10,000 fair housing discrimination complaints were filed in fiscal year 2010, according to the report. Discrimination based on a person's disability continued to be the largest single category of complaints. Of the 10,155 complaints filed with HUD and its Fair Housing Assistance Program partner agencies, 48 percent alleged disability discrimination, 34 percent alleged discrimination based on race, and 15 percent alleged discrimination based on family status - consistent with the number and type of complaints received during the previous three years.
The report shows that in fiscal year 2010, HUD and its Fair Housing Assistance Program partner agencies processed 4,494 new complaints within 100 days, 328 more than in 2009 and 583 more than in 2008. The report also shows that HUD proactively pursued its own Secretary-initiated investigations, charging four and conciliating eight cases that developed from such investigations, and launching another 10 such investigations.
This year's report shows that HUD has placed greater emphasis on ensuring that recipients of HUD funding create greater housing opportunities for minorities, families with children, and people with disabilities. In 2009, Westchester County, New York, a recipient of HUD funding, entered into a settlement agreement with HUD and others to resolve claims that the county had falsely certified compliance with the requirement to affirmatively further fair housing. HUD continues to work with the federal monitor and the county to ensure the county's full compliance with the agreement.
HUD's activities in fiscal year 2010 have led to significant relief for victims of housing discrimination, including:
African Americans in whose neighborhoods a bank did not locate branches or provide banking services. A conciliation agreement between HUD, the Metropolitan St. Louis Equal Housing Opportunity Council, and the First National Bank of St. Louis, Missouri, provides that the bank will increase its commitment to minority and low-income communities by, among other things, investing more than $2.5 million over four years in St. Louis City, North St. Louis County, and St. Clair County, Illinois. Women on maternity leave who were denied mortgage loans and insurance. HUD launched a landmark maternity leave case investigation that resulted in a settlement with Cornerstone Mortgage Company and a charge against Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Corporation (MGIC). In the settlement, a Washington state woman was awarded $15,000 based on her claims that she was denied a mortgage loan even though she was on paid maternity leave and planned to return to work. The settlement also created a $750,000 victims' fund to compensate other borrowers who experienced discrimination because they were on pregnancy or maternity leave at the time they were applying for a loan. In a separate action, HUD charged MGIC with discriminating against a Pennsylvania family by denying their application for mortgage insurance unless and until the wife returned to work from maternity leave. African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, and families with children who were tenants or prospective tenants of an apartment complex that engaged in widespread discriminatory rental practices. In 2010, HUD charged the owners and managers of the subject apartment complex in Renton, Washington. In 2011, the Department of Justice reached a settlement agreement that provides that the housing provider will, among other things, pay $85,000 in damages and $25,000 in civil penalties and maintain a common recreational area for all tenants, including children. Six families with children who were charged fees for using the common recreational areas of a condominium. In 2009, HUD charged the owners and managers of the subject condominium in Methuen, Massachusetts. In 2010, the Department of Justice obtained a consent decree under which the housing provider must, among other things, pay $130,000 in damages and $20,000 in civil penalties.

In addition, the report highlights how HUD, through its Section 3 program, is creating jobs for low-income residents of areas where HUD-funded construction is taking place, and contracting opportunities for the businesses that hire them. Between 2009 and 2010, the program provided jobs to more than 16,000 residents and contracts to 2,900 Section 3 businesses. HUD also announced, in June, that it was providing $600,000 in competitive grants to enable public housing authorities and state and local agencies that receive Section 3 funding to hire a program coordinator to help report on the success of their job creation and training efforts.
Going forward, HUD will continue to reach out to groups that have historically lacked sufficient protection from housing discrimination, such as lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender persons. HUD has announced that it will issue a rule to clarify that the term ""family,"" when used in HUD programs, includes all eligible LGBT couples and individuals.
Furthermore, the Department is expanding its education and outreach to immigrants. HUD is conducting fair housing conferences throughout the nation to raise awareness of fair housing rights among advocacy and social service organizations working with immigrant communities. Also, as part of HUD's efforts to make its programs accessible to all, the agency has translated more than 100 vital documents into 17 different languages.

FHEO and its partners in the Fair Housing Assistance Program investigate more than 10,000 housing discrimination complaints annually. People who believe they are the victims of housing discrimination should contact HUD at 1-800-669-9777 (voice), 800-927-9275 (TTY)."
08/30/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-180.cfm,HUD Launches Development of a National Housing and Transportation Affordability Index,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced it has awarded The Manhattan Strategy Group, LLC and its subcontractor the Center for Neighborhood Technology (CNT) a $3.2 million contract to create a national Housing and Transportation Affordability Index. The groundbreaking index will provide potential homebuyers with a true estimate of both housing and transportation costs that can in turn help them make a more educated decision.
""Affordability is much more than just paying the mortgage, it involves other costs like transportation, gas, and utilities. The availability of a national affordability index will provide consumers better information about the true costs of a home by accounting for that housing's proximity to jobs, schools and other services. Our goal with the creation of this housing and transportation index is to provide American families with a tool that can help them save money and have a better understanding of their expenses and household budget,"" said Shaun Donovan, Secretary of U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
Traditionally, affordability indices determined cost of living by factoring the percentage of a family's income devoted to housing and dividing the average housing costs by the median family income. Transportation, which is usually a household's second most significant expense, has not been part of this equation.
""Unfortunately, many people believe that in order to qualify for a mortgage they have to buy a house far away from their work. People may think they are saving money by buying a house that is cheaper, but the transportation costs could end up making their total costs more expensive in the long run,"" said Shelley Poticha, Director of the Office of Sustainable Housing and Communities at HUD.
According to a recent study of 28 metropolitan areas done by the Center for Housing Policy and CNT, the average household pays 27% of its income for housing and 20.2% of its income to transportation. For working families earning $50,000, these costs account for 57% of the household income.
""Manhattan Strategy Group (MSG) is pleased to partner with HUD to develop and test a Housing and Transportation Affordability Index Tool to build greater transparency into the true cost of housing,"" stated Shezad Habib, Director of MSG. ""Over the next two years we will work collaboratively with HUD and our partner, the Center for Neighborhood Technology (CNT), to enable HUD programs, affordable housing and transportation practitioners, policy-makers, developers, and the public-at-large to make informed planning and land use decisions and investments. We commend HUD on this initiative which is aimed at helping local housing and transportation officials develop, implement, and improve the delivery of affordable housing in their jurisdictions.""
""Transportation costs are the second largest expense in a household budget, but they are often not considered when people choose where to live or developers choose where to invest,"" said Kathryn Tholin, CEO of the Center for Neighborhood Technology (CNT). ""The H+T Affordability Index helps make those costs transparent so people and policy makers can make more-informed housing choices and investment decisions. CNT is excited to work with the Manhattan Strategy Group to assist HUD in exploring how to incorporate this metric into its work.""
The creation of a national housing and transportation affordability index will also help analyze the impacts of HUD programs on the combined cost of housing and transportation in HUD-supported communities and assess the feasibility of improving outcomes and making programs and policies more efficient. The contract announced by HUD will build upon previous work done in this research area, but also establish a peer review panel of federal and industry stakeholders. HUD is committed to ensuring a transparent and rigorous process of developing a national housing and transportation affordability index, and ensuring comprehensive input regarding potential policy applications."

Chicago, Boston, New Orleans, San Francisco and Seattle will receive the first-ever Implementation Grants awarded under HUD's Choice Neighborhoods Initiative, a new strategy and tools to support local leaders in transforming high-poverty, distressed neighborhoods into neighborhoods with healthy, affordable housing, safe streets, and access to quality educational opportunities.
The grants announced today include:
Read a complete summary of each grant announced today.
""We'll win the future only if we can ensure that people in every community - even those living in our most troubled neighborhoods - have access to the American Dream,"" said President Barack Obama. ""With HUD's Choice Neighborhoods grants, my Administration has brought local communities an innovative new tool to ensure that all families can access the quality affordable housing, safe streets, and good schools they need to compete in the 21st century economy.""
""This is a great day for these communities and the countless people who will benefit from the transformation this funding will bring to their neighborhoods,"" said Donovan, who announced the grants today. ""Choice Neighborhoods recognizes that we must link affordable housing with quality education, public transportation, good jobs and safe streets. It is the next generation of neighborhood revitalization that not only transforms distressed housing, but heals entire communities.""
""Choice Neighborhoods provides funds to improve the lives of children and families in our most distressed neighborhoods and we're pleased to see their work continue through these implementation grants,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan. ""The White House Neighborhood Revitalization Initiative, which includes our Promise Neighborhoods program together with Choice and other initiatives, has created a cross agency effort that combats poverty by ensuring there are great schools and systems of support at the center of every community.""
Choice Neighborhoods (Choice) promotes a comprehensive approach to transforming distressed areas of concentrated poverty into viable and sustainable mixed-income neighborhoods. Building on the successes of HUD's HOPE VI Program, Choice links housing improvements with a wide variety of public services and neighborhood improvements to create neighborhoods of opportunity.
These grantees have completed comprehensive local planning processes, and are now implementing plans to redevelop their neighborhoods. They had to demonstrate their ability to revitalize severely distressed public and/or assisted housing while bringing together the partnerships and resources to create high-quality public schools, outstanding education and early learning programs, public assets, public transportation, and improved access to jobs and well-functioning services.
The Choice Neighborhoods Initiative is a centerpiece of the Obama Administration's interagency Neighborhood Revitalization Initiative - a collaboration between the Departments of Housing and Urban Development, Education (ED), Justice, Treasury and Health and Human Services (HHS) to support the ability of local leaders from the public and private sectors and attract the private investment needed to transform distressed neighborhoods into sustainable, mixed-income neighborhoods with the affordable housing, safe streets and good schools every family needs.
As a result of partnerships across those agencies, the Obama Administration has made it easier for local leaders using Choice Neighborhoods to redevelop their neighborhoods to also access support for cradle-to-career educational programs through the Education Department's Promise Neighborhoods, public safety strategies through the Justice Department, and community health center improvements through HHS."

Dick Durbin and Rep. Bobby Rush today announced that the city of Chicago will receive $30.5 million to redevelop the distressed housing at Grove Parc Plaza and revitalize the Woodlawn neighborhood on the city's south side.
Chicago is one of just five cities nationwide to receive the first-ever Implementation Grants awarded under HUD's Choice Neighborhoods Initiative, a new strategic approach intended to help transform high-poverty, distressed neighborhoods into communities with healthy, affordable housing, safe streets, and access to quality educational opportunities.

""I am committed to protecting and investing in Chicago's communities,"" said Mayor Emanuel. ""This important program will create safe and affordable housing for hard-working families in the Woodlawn community, and will have lasting impact on our neighborhoods.""
Sen. Dick Durbin said, ""The federal funding announced today, along with commitments from more than a dozen public and private sector partners, will provide more than $272 million in direct investments to transform the Woodlawn Neighborhood. But this forward-looking program goes beyond simply renovating public and assisted housing projects. It provides a platform for revitalizing entire neighborhoods with the promise of long-term sustainability and affordability.""
Rep. Bobby Rush added, ""This is a vitally important investment of American tax payer dollars. On its face it is an investment in affordable housing but what we're really talking about here is an investment in the upward mobility of people. I am proud to have been able to work with the tenants and POAH for almost a decade as we sought to end the decline of Grove Parc while respecting the aspirations of stakeholders large and small. I congratulate Secretary Donovan for his vision and deep understanding of the quality of life issues integral to all housing development. Chicago's Woodlawn Community is indeed the neighborhood of choice for many of our citizens and deserves this Choice Neighborhoods Award.""
Preservation of Affordable Housing Inc. (POAH) (www.poah.org/about/mission.htm), a non-profit housing developer, and the city of Chicago will redevelop Grove Parc Plaza, a 504-unit HUD-assisted housing development built in the 1960s on a 12-acre site in the Woodlawn neighborhood on the south side of Chicago. Crime, vacant homes and lots, poor schools, unemployment, and lack of access to needed services and amenities plagued the site and broader neighborhood. After being threatened with foreclosure because of poor conditions in 2007, Grove Parc residents invited the nonprofit development company, POAH, to intervene to preserve the affordable housing. POAH formed a partnership with the city of Chicago, the Jane Adams Hull House, the University of Chicago, LISC Chicago, and other community partners to redevelop Grove Parc Plaza and revitalize the surrounding Woodlawn neighborhood.
In addition to a wide ranging set of services and neighborhood investments, a total of 965 units are now planned, including replacing the original affordable units, and integrating them with additional workforce, market rate rental and homeownership units. The total direct investment associated with the Choice Neighborhoods funding is estimated to be $272 million.

08/31/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-190.cfm,HUD Makes $1.63 Billion in Grants Available for Homeless Programs,"WASHINGTON - Today, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan announced that HUD will award $1.63 billion for Fiscal Year 2011 to support nearly 7,000 existing homeless assistance programs currently operating and create additional new homeless assistance programs with the Continuum of Care (CoC) Homeless Assistance Program Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA).
The funding, for which the notice was published today, will provide permanent and transitional housing to homeless persons as well as services including job training, health care, mental health counseling, substance abuse treatment and child care. Continuum of Care grants are awarded competitively to local programs to meet the needs of their homeless clients. These grants fund a wide variety of programs from street outreach and assessment programs to transitional and permanent housing for homeless persons and families.
""Supporting funding to our homeless programs helps the federal government save taxpayer dollars by ending the costly cycling through shelters, emergency rooms, detox centers, and hospitals,"" said Secretary Donovan. ""We mustn't forget the nation's most vulnerable citizens and I am glad that Congress has also recognized the importance and success of our homeless work by continuing to fully fund this effort.""
HUD's homeless assistance grants are reducing long-term or chronic homelessness in America. Based on the Department's latest homeless assessment, chronic homelessness has declined since 2005 due to significant investments to produce thousands of units of permanent supportive housing for those who had been living on the streets. While the total number of homeless persons in America dropped slightly between 2008 and 2009, the number of homeless families increased for the second consecutive year, almost certainly due to the ongoing effects of the recession.
In addition to HUD's annual grant awards, HUD allocated $1.5 billion through its new Homeless Prevention and Rapid Re-housing (HPRP) Program. Made possible through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, HPRP is intended to prevent persons from falling into homelessness or to rapidly re-house them if they do. To date, nearly 1 million people have been assisted through HPRP.
Last year, 19 federal agencies in the Obama Administration announced a plan to end all homelessness through, Opening Doors, an unprecedented federal strategy to end veteran and chronic homelessness by 2015, and to end homelessness among children, families, and youth by 2020. In addition to the Continuum of Care grant program, HUD's new Homelessness Prevention and Rapid Re-housing (HPRP) Program made possible through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 is making a major contribution to the Opening Doors strategy. To date, HPRP has allocated $1.5 billion to prevent more than 875,000 people from falling into homelessness or to rapidly re-house them if they do.
Project applications are available today and can be found at www.hud.gov/esnaps. For entities needing assistance with grant applications, online training is available at www.hudhre.info/esnaps/. Applications are due no later than Friday, October 28, 2011."
08/31/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-191.cfm,HUD Charges Iowa Landlords with Discriminating Against Child with Cerebral Palsy and Her Mother,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced that it is charging John and Nancy Meany, owners of an apartment building in Traer, Iowa, with violating the Fair Housing Act for refusing to accommodate a request from a family with a child with cerebral palsy. HUD brings the charge on behalf of the child and her mother, claiming the owners refused to allow the seven-year-old girl to have a medically-prescribed emotional support animal. Additionally, the owners allegedly told the mother that if she got the animal, she would have to either move or pay more money to stay.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful for landlords to refuse a reasonable accommodation in their rules, policies, practices, or services when needed to provide persons with disabilities an equal opportunity to use or enjoy a dwelling. It is also against the law to impose different rules and restrictions on those who make such request, including charging them extra.
""Threatening parents with eviction for requesting an emotional support animal for a child with disabilities or charging more for having one is against the law,"" said John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD is committed to ensuring that landlords comply with fair housing laws and provide the accommodations that may be necessary for tenants with disabilities to have the same opportunities to enjoy their homes.""
According to HUD's charge, the mother and her daughter were aware of the housing provider's ""no-pet policy"" when they moved in and did not contest it at that time. Later, recalling that the Labrador retriever who previously lived with them had alleviated stress for her daughter, the mother asked the owners to permit the daughter to have a dog live with them, and provided documentation of the need for the animal from the daughter's pediatrician and therapist. The owners denied the request, stating, ""We are not intending to modify the 'no pet policy' on our property."" The owners further stated that if the mother insisted on bringing the dog in to help her daughter to better cope with her condition, they would collect a $200 deposit and charge an extra $25 per month more for rent.
The mother and child eventually moved out of the building to another apartment, which cost more and was much farther from the child's school.
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages to aggrieved persons for the discrimination.
The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief to deter further discrimination, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose fines in order to vindicate the public interest. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages to aggrieved persons.
FHEO and its partners in the Fair Housing Assistance Program investigate more than 10,000 housing discrimination complaints annually. People who believe they are the victims of housing discrimination should contact HUD at 1-800-669-9777 (voice), (800) 927-9275 (TTY)."
09/01/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-186.cfm,HUD Awards $30.5 Million to New Orleans to Redevelop Iberville,"NEW ORLEANS - U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Assistant Secretary Sandra B. Henriquez joined Mayor Mitchell J. Landrieu today to announce that the Housing Authority of New Orleans (HANO) and the city of New Orleans will receive $30.5 million to redevelop the distressed housing at the Iberville Housing Development and revitalize the Treme neighborhood.
New Orleans is one of just five cities nationwide to receive the first-ever Implementation Grants awarded under HUD's Choice Neighborhoods Initiative (Choice), a new strategic approach intended to help transform high-poverty, distressed neighborhoods into communities with healthy, affordable housing, safe streets, and access to quality educational opportunities. New Orleans joins Boston, Chicago, San Francisco and Seattle to receive a combined $122 million.
""We'll win the future only if we can ensure that people in every community--even those living in our most troubled neighborhoods--have access to the American Dream,"" said President Barack Obama. With HUD's Choice Neighborhoods grants, my Administration has brought local communities an innovative new tool to ensure that all families can access the quality affordable housing, safe streets, and good schools they need to compete in the 21st century economy.
""This is a great day for the housing authority, New Orleans and the countless families who will benefit from the transformation this funding will bring to the Treme community,"" said Henriquez. ""Choice Neighborhoods recognizes that we must link affordable housing with quality schools, public transportation, good jobs and safe streets. This is the next generation of neighborhood revitalization that not only transforms distressed housing, but heals entire communities.""
""We are proud that the Obama Administration chose New Orleans for this new initiative,"" said Landrieu. ""The Treme community plays a vital role in the city's heritage and cultural identity. This grant provides us with an essential tool to transform lives and revitalize one of the greatest neighborhoods in the country.""
""Working on the Iberville/Treme Choice Neighborhoods Initiatives application has been a moving experience for me,"" said HANO Administrative Receiver David Gilmore. ""I can't imagine another city that deserves the grant more or will make better use of the benefits it will bring. I'm especially delighted at the opportunity this process has provided for HANO to reconnect with the city it serves and I'm proud of the partnerships we are forging with the administration, Iberville residents, the Recovery School District, the development teams, the community at large, and so many other great organizations. The future holds so many good things for us and the Choice grant will help us achieve them.""
""We're moving beyond restoring buildings. We're restoring whole communities. Families need affordable housing and they also need neighborhoods with resources that support their growth--such as job training centers and child learning centers,"" said Congressman Cedric Richmond (LA-02). ""With this Choice grant we can develop Iberville and Treme to be a community that helps folks fully access their rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.""
""Choice Neighborhoods provides funds to improve the lives of children and families in our most distressed neighborhoods and we're pleased to see their work continue through these implementation grants,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan. ""The White House Neighborhood Revitalization Initiative, which includes our Promise Neighborhoods program together with Choice and other initiatives, has created a cross agency effort that combats poverty by ensuring there are great schools and systems of support at the center of every community.""
Though adjacent to the thriving French Quarter and Central Business District, the Treme neighborhood has a household poverty rate that tops 52 percent. To help revitalize the community and combat poverty, the Iberville/Treme Transformation Plan will target the Iberville public housing project's 821 distressed units. Built in 1940 as a superblock of 74 two- and three-story buildings, only 441 of these units are currently occupied. Fifty buildings will be replaced, and the remaining 24 will be reconfigured and restored. Once complete, the new development will boast 913 units, 304 of which will be public housing available to current Iberville development residents. The rmaining 609 units will be split evenly between market rate and low-income housing tax credits. Moreover, another 1,518 rental units will be built in the neighborhood, more than a third of which will be project-based public housing. Another 15 sites will become homeownership units.
In addition to rehabilitating and revitalizing housing, the Iberville/Treme Transformation Plan will implement a number of social and supportive services to help promote safer, better-educated community with the tools its residents need to achieve self-sufficiency. A partnership among HRI Properties, McCormack Baron Salazar, Inc., Urban Strategies, Recovery School District, Workforce Investment Authority, Covenant Huose, Tulane Community Health Clinic, the New Orleans Police Department, and the Early Childhood & Family Learning Foundation, the Iberville/Treme Transformation Plan is projected to cost $662 million in total.
Choice Neighborhoods promotes a comprehensive approach to transforming distressed areas of concentrated poverty into viable and sustainable mixed-income neighborhoods. Building on the successes of HUD's HOPE VI Program, Choice links housing improvements with a wide variety of public services and neighborhood improvements to create neighborhoods of opportunity.
New Orleans as well as the other four grantees have completed comprehensive local planning processes, and are now implementing plans to redevelop their neighborhoods. They had to demonstrate their ability to revitalize severely distressed public and/or assisted housing while bringing together the partnerships and resources to create high-quality public schools, outstanding education and early learning programs, public assets, public transportation, and improved access to jobs and well-functioning services.
The Choice Neighborhoods Initiative is a centerpiece of the Obama Administration's interagency Neighborhood Revitalization Initiative--a collaboration between the Departments of Housing and Urban Development, Education, Justice, Treasury, and Health and Human Services (HHS) to support the ability of local leaders from the public and private sectors and attract the private investment needed to transform distressed neighborhoods into sustainable, mixed-income neighborhoods with the affordable housing, safe streets and good schools every family needs.
As a result of partnerships across those agencies, the Obama Administration has made it easier for local leaders using Choice Neighborhoods to redevelop their neighborhoods to also access support for cradle-to-career educational programs through the Education Department's Promise Neighborhoods, public safety strategies through the Justice Department, and community health center improvements through HHS."

09/01/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-193.cfm,Obama Administration Releases August Housing Scorecard Featuring Making Home Affordable Servicer Assessments,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of the Treasury today released the August edition of the Obama Administration's Housing Scorecard. Included in this month's report are detailed assessments for the 10 largest mortgage servicers participating in the Making Home Affordable Program with results from the second quarter of 2011. In addition to providing greater transparency about servicer performance in the program, the servicer assessments - first introduced in June and published quarterly - are intended to set a new industry benchmark for disclosure around servicer efforts to assist struggling homeowners, while prompting them to correct identified deficiencies. The full report is available online at www.hud.gov/scorecard.
""While tens of thousands of additional homeowners benefit from the Administration's programs each month, we need to keep the pressure on servicers to effectively assist those homeowners who are still struggling and eligible for assistance,"" said Treasury Assistant Secretary for Financial Stability Tim Massad. ""These assessments provide an unprecedented level of information about servicer performance and are designed to help more eligible homeowners walk away from this process with better results.""
""The Obama Administration is dedicated to helping homeowners who were negatively affected by the housing crisis and this month's scorecard shows signs of these programs working,"" said HUD Assistant Secretary Raphael Bostic. ""Data shows improvements in home prices, which have increased three months in a row, and a reduction in foreclosure starts and completions, which have been trending downward since fall 2010. Although the data suggests improvement, we are still continuing to work with homeowners, lenders, servicers, and others so that this positive trend continues.""
As the Administration continues to take steps to prompt servicers to provide more effective assistance to struggling homeowners through its foreclosure prevention programs, the continued fragility of the housing market demonstrates the need for the Administration's recovery efforts in hard hit communities:
Administration efforts have helped improve servicer performance in assisting struggling homeowners. While more progress needs to be made, servicers have been focusing attention on areas of need identified through regular compliance and program reviews, with results published in the Administration's quarterly Servicer Assessments. Since inception of the voluntary Making Home Affordable Program, Treasury has required participating servicers to take specific actions to improve their servicing processes to more effectively assist struggling homeowners. As a result, there are more options for assistance available to struggling homeowners today than have ever been available before. The Administration's efforts have helped millions of families deal with the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. More than 5 million mortgage aid arrangements were started between April 2009 and the end of July 2011. While some homeowners may have received help from more than one program, the total number of aid offers is more than double the number of foreclosure completions for the same period (2.2 million). In July, more than 28,000 additional homeowners received a permanent modification through the Administration's Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP); more than 790,000 homeowners across the country have now received a HAMP permanent modification with a median payment reduction of 37 percent. To date, homeowners in permanent modifications have realized aggregate savings in monthly mortgage payments of nearly $7.8 billion. View the July HAMP Servicer Performance Report. (www.treasury.gov/initiatives/financial-stability/results/MHA-Reports/Pages/default.aspx) Housing market remains fragile as data through July paint a mixed picture of recovery. Home prices as reported by S&P/Case-Shiller and FHFA were up for the third consecutive month in July after several previous months of decline. Foreclosure starts and completions continued a downward trend, as mortgage aid programs are helping homeowners, although some of the decline remains due to lender processing issues delaying some foreclosure actions. The fragility of the market is underscored by the fact mortgage delinquencies rose slightly in July.

The Servicer Assessments summarize performance for the 10 largest Making Home Affordable participating servicers from reviews largely conducted throughout the second quarter of 2011 on three categories of program implementation: identifying and contacting homeowners; homeowner evaluation and assistance; and program reporting, management and governance. Although some improvements have been made, based on the reviews for this quarter, Bank of America, NA and J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, NA remain in need of substantial improvement. Both servicers were subject to withholding of financial incentives under the program based on results from the first quarter and will continue to have their incentives withheld until their performance improves.
While Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC and Wells Fargo Bank, NA were both found to be in need of substantial improvement in the first quarter of 2011, compliance activities conducted to follow up on their progress and assess other areas of program implementation found that both mortgage servicers have corrected identified deficiencies from the first quarter. Both servicers were found to be in need of moderate improvement in the second quarter.
Details on the review process and more information on the Administration's Servicer Assessments, which will be issued on a quarterly basis, can be found at http://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/financial-stability/results/MHA-Reports/Pages/default.aspx."

This is unspent funding from the 2010 appropriation that was re-competed and awarded to HUD-approved counseling agencies.
""The funding announced today is specifically earmarked to provide counseling assistance relating to mortgage modification, avoiding potential mortgage scams, and assisting victims of scams,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""It is crucial that we support these agencies in helping struggling families do whatever is possible to avoid foreclosure without being victimized by so called mortgage 'rescue' companies.""
HUD is awarding $3 million to 139 local housing counseling agencies nationwide, and more than $7 million to 23 housing counseling intermediary agencies. These funds are designed to serve residents in the nation's top 100 metropolitan areas that are experiencing the worse foreclosure problems.
The funding is predominately for foreclosure prevention counseling, assistance with application to Federal and other mortgage modification and loss mitigation programs, and related outreach. It will also support outreach and counseling efforts designed to identify and assist victims of mortgage modification scams, and report those cases to the applicable authorities.
HUD awards grants under the housing counseling program through a competitive process. Organizations that apply for grants must be HUD-approved and are subject to performance reviews to maintain their HUD-approved status.

09/02/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-196.cfm,HUD Announces $25 Million in Available Grants for New Energy Innovation Fund Multifamily Pilot Program,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today announced that $25 million is available through HUD's new Multifamily Energy Efficiency Pilot program. Once awarded, these grants will help develop new innovative approaches for multifamily residential properties to reduce their energy consumption, lower greenhouse gas emissions, while saving money for the residents, property owners and taxpayers. Read the full text of the funding notice published today on HUD's website.
""HUD is extremely excited about this pilot program because it aligns with the goals of the Administration to create green jobs and build sustainable communities,"" said Acting Federal Housing Commissioner Carol Galante. ""The innovations that flow from this pilot program will serve as models to create future industry standards in energy efficiency.""
""Rather than tell applicants what we want to see, we are asking the private sector to develop new innovative approaches to create jobs and help people save energy and save money. Since these grants will be complemented by private capital, the investors will also have a unique opportunity to become leaders in helping make affordable multifamily homes greener,"" said Theodore Toon, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary for HUD's Office of Affordable Housing Preservation.
The goal of the pilot program is to develop ideas and mechanisms that could potentially be replicated nationally, as well as help create industry standards in the home energy efficiency retrofit market. In addition, the pilot program will create a public/private partnership as a result of capital investments from private industries and create green jobs in construction, property management, and technical analysis (e.g. energy audits and building commissioning), including opportunities for low income residents."
09/06/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-197.cfm,HUD Awards $52.6 Million to Native American Communities for Housing and Economic Development for Low-Income Families,"WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development awarded more than $52 million in grants to tribal communities in 21 states to improve or create housing and economic development opportunities for low- to moderate-income families. The competitive grants are provided through HUD's Indian Community Development Block Grant (ICDBG) Program to support a wide variety of community development and affordable housing activities.
""These funds will help American Indian and Alaska Native tribal governments create sustainable and community-driven solutions,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""Housing and infrastructure needs in Indian Country are severe and widespread. I'm inspired by the work the tribal communities are taking on to leverage these funds and get their communities on the right track.""
For example, the Comanche Nation Housing Authority of Oklahoma will rehab more than two dozen houses for families currently living in substandard homes, including new roofs, doors, windows, insulation, electrical system and plumbing repairs, siding, flooring, cabinets and counters, and HVAC upgrades. In White Earth, New Mexico, a new 12,800-square-foot Workforce Development Center will provide workforce skills and vocational training to assist tribal members in obtaining employment.
In California, the Quechan Tribe will improve roads and sidewalks in a neighborhood with predominantly low and very-low income families with high amounts of foot traffic. In California, the Yurok Reservation will get multipurpose park and recreation facility. In Montana, families at the Mutual Help project in Northern Cheyenne will have their homes rehabbed to reduce the amount of substandard housing in the community.
The ICDBG program was established in 1977 to help Indian tribes and Alaska Native villages to meet their community development needs. Federally recognized Indian tribes, bands, groups or nations (including Alaska Indian, Aleuts and Eskimos,) or Alaska Native villages compete for this funding. The recipients use the funding to develop viable communities, including rehabilitating housing or building new housing or to buy land to support new housing construction.
The funding can also be used to build infrastructure such as roads, water and sewer facilities, and to create suitable living environments. To spur economic development, recipients have used the grants to establish a wide variety of commercial, industrial and agricultural projects. The grants have been used to build community and health centers, or to start businesses to support the community, such as shopping centers, manufacturing plants, restaurants or convenient stores/gas stations."
09/06/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-198.cfm,"HUD Charges Connecticut Property Owner, Manager with Denying Housing to African American Family","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced that it is charging Merline and Clifton Hylton, the owner and manager of a rental home in Windsor Locks, Connecticut with violating the Fair Housing Act for denying a request by biracial tenants to sublease their home to an African American family. The current tenants allege that Mr. Hylton told them he was rejecting the prospective sub-tenants because he ""did not want too many blacks at the property.""
HUD brings the charge on behalf of the tenants and the African-American family denied the sublease. The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing discrimination based on race or color, including making discriminatory statements, establishing a preference, or imposing different terms and conditions based on race or color.
""Despite the progress we've made as a nation, overt acts of discrimination still occur today,"" said John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Whether discrimination is hidden or out in the open, HUD will combat it and hold those who violate the law accountable.""
According to HUD's charge, the current residents notified Mr. Hylton, president of Hylton Real Estate Management, Inc., that they needed to move, requiring them to break their lease agreement. They informed Mr. Hylton that they would find a suitable renter to sublease the house. Subsequently, when the husband told Mr. Hylton that he had found someone, Hylton asked if the person is white. When the husband said that the prospective tenant is black, Hylton allegedly stated that he ""did not want too many blacks at the property"" and that ""the neighbors would not want to see too many blacks there."" Hylton also allegedly told the husband that the only reason he rented the house to him was because his wife is white and it was ""a good mix.""
The husband subsequently told the prospective tenant that the owner had refused to approve subletting the house to her and her family. When the current residents moved out and sought their security deposit, Mr. Hylton refused without explanation.
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages to aggrieved persons for the damages caused them by the discrimination.
The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief to deter further discrimination, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose fines in order to vindicate the public interest. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages to aggrieved persons.
FHEO and its partners in the Fair Housing Assistance Program investigate more than 10,000 housing discrimination complaints annually. People who believe they are the victims of housing discrimination should contact HUD at 1-800-669-9777 (voice), (800) 927-9275 (TTY)."

09/08/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-206.cfm,"HUD Awards $13.3 Million to Bring Jobs, Revitalize 'Brownfields' in Six Cities","WASHINGTON - In six cities across the country, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is awarding $13.3 million to stimulate job growth and revitalize unproductive industrial areas known as 'brownfields.' The grants announced today, combined with an addition $35 million in federal loan guarantees, will generate total public and private investment in these areas to more than $166 million.
Philadelphia; Cleveland; Toledo, Ohio; Santa Rosa, California; Taunton, Massachusetts; and Ranson; West Virginia will each receive grants under HUD's Brownfields Economic Development Initiative (BEDI) and expect to create nearly 2,000 jobs as part of their redevelopment strategies.
""These grants, and the other investments they generate, will not only help redevelop environmentally distressed areas in these cities, they'll put people to work!"" said HUD Secretary Donovan. ""This is a win-win for these cities. The funding we announce today creates jobs while reversing years of neglect in areas that are ripe for economic development and even more job growth in the future.""
HUD is announcing the following grants:
Often perceived as unproductive eyesores in their communities, brownfields hold tremendous potential as sites for community revitalization. Many of these brownfield sites are strategically located in or around key areas and were, in many cases, the economic centers of their communities. Redevelopment of these sites is both a challenge and an opportunity and returning them to productive use can serve as a catalyst for local economic recovery.
These six cities will amplify the grants they receive today through HUD's Section 108 Loan Guarantee Assistance Program which enables local governments to borrow money at reduced interest rates to promote economic development, stimulate job growth and improve public facilities. Such public investment is often needed to secure private investment in the projects and catalyze markets for continued growth in affected communities and businesses.
Donovan added, ""These are tough times for cities looking to invest in growth-oriented development and to kick start their economies. It's our job to help them in any way we can as we focus on job growth for those invested in remaking their home towns.""
The Following are summaries of the projects that received BEDI funds:
The City of Toledo, Ohio will receive a BEDI grant of $2 million and a Section 108 Loan for $10 million for The Tower on the Maumee. This mixed-use project will revitalize the former Owens Corning building and create 140,371 square feet of office space on 11 floors, a 96-room Marriott Courtyard on seven floors, and 81 apartments on nine floors, with retail and restaurants in the lobby area. The building is a significant landmark, designed by the architecture firm of Harrison and Abramowitz, which also designed the United Nations headquarters. This project will create 368 permanent jobs. The BEDI will leverage $6.4 million in other funds already committed to the project. The total project cost is $29.4 million.
The City of Santa Rosa, California will receive a BEDI grant of $1.5 million and apply for a Section 108 Loan for $5.6 million for the first phase of a three phase transit oriented development called New Railroad Square. The project will develop a Club One Health facility within the historic walls of the 1908 Santa Rosa Cannery. It is projected that the health club will generate 232 full time positions. The BEDI will leverage $779,000 in other funds already committed to the project. The total project cost is $19.9 million.
The City of Cleveland, Ohio will receive a BEDI grant of $3 million and a Section 108 Loan for $10 million for the cleanup and redevelopment of the former Warner and Swasey Facility. The project will transform the property into over 180,000 square feet of office, lab, warehouse and light manufacturing and post incubator space in support of the Health-Tech Corridor. HUD funding will result in the creation of up to 360 permanent full time equivalent positions. The total project cost is estimated to be more than $19 million.
The City of Ranson, West Virginia will receive a BEDI grant of $1.5 million and a Section 108 Loan for $3 million to redevelop the former Kiddie Fire Fighting foundry. The project is part of the Obama Administration's Partnership for Sustainable Communities and will prepare a 6-acre site for development of an anchor building in the Powhatan Place Town Center project, by demolishing dilapidated buildings and remediating environmental contamination. This project will create 150 jobs in downtown Ranson. Total project cost is $7.8 million.
The City of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania will receive a BEDI grant of $1.25 million and will apply for a Section 108 Loan for $1.75 million for the first phase of the Edison Square Project. The project entails demolishing a high school that has been vacant for more than 9 years, and construction of a retail center. Phase one of the project will include a grocery store, stores selling electronics and general merchandise, and restaurants. The second phase of the project will be an affordable housing development. The project will create 100 permanent full-time jobs in a community where poverty and unemployment are currently more than twice the national rates. The total project cost is approximately $11 million.
The City of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania will receive a BEDI grant of $3 million and will apply for a Section 108 Loan for $3 million for the Bakers Centre Project. The project will involve new construction of a 219,000 square foot community shopping center anchored by a supermarket, on a 30-acre parcel vacated by Tasty Baking. This development addresses community needs in a ""food desert"" and will also include benefits such as a preventive-care health clinic and credit union. It is projected that this project will create 650 permanent jobs. Unemployment and poverty levels in the surrounding community are currently more than twice the national rates. The BEDI will leverage $12 million in other funds already committed to the project. The total project cost is approximately $53 million.
The City of Taunton, Massachusetts will receive a BEDI grant of $1 million and will apply for a Section 108 Loan for $2 million for the remediation of a vacant parcel as part of Fairfax Gardens, a transit-oriented mixed income housing project. The project will create 86 jobs of which 67 - more than the required 51% - will benefit low- and moderate income persons in the project area. The BEDI will leverage $8.3 million in other funds already committed to the project. The total project cost is $26 million."
09/08/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-207.cfm,HUD Charges Wisconsin Landlord for Insisting on a Man in the House,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is charging a La Crosse County, Wisconsin landlord with violating the Fair Housing Act for refusing to rent a house to a single mother because there was no adult male to live with her. HUD brings the charge on behalf of the single woman, claiming that the owner of the property, Dovenberg Investments, LLC and property manager Darlene Dovenberg refused to rent a house in rural Bangor to the woman because she, among other things, did not have a man ""to shovel the snow.""
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing discrimination of any sort based on sex and family status.
""Fairness dictates, and the Fair Housing Act requires, that housing decisions not be based on outmoded stereotypes of people's 'place' in our society,"" stated John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will enforce the law whenever a housing provider seeks to limit a woman's housing choices because of her gender or family composition.""
According to HUD's charge, when the single woman called to inquire about renting the home, Dovenberg told her that she could not show her the property or rent to her because she did not have a man ""to shovel the snow and stuff,"" and abruptly terminated the call with the woman.
During HUD's investigation, Dovenberg admitted that she believed a single woman would not be able to handle the seclusion and the snow removal, and that she didn't want the woman calling her all the time to come out to fix things or to plow her out. Dovenberg also told a HUD investigator that she never rents to single women with children, ""especially not in the country."" Dovenberg went on to offer her opinions regarding single women to HUD staff several times during the investigation.
Dovenberg subsequently rented the property to two men.
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages to aggrieved persons for the damages caused them by the discrimination.
The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief to deter further discrimination, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose fines in order to vindicate the public interest. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages to aggrieved persons.
FHEO and its partners in the Fair Housing Assistance Program investigate more than 10,000 housing discrimination complaints annually. People who believe they are the victims of housing discrimination should contact HUD at 1-800-669-9777 (voice), (800) 927-9275 (TTY)."
09/13/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-208.cfm,"Obama Administration Prevented, Ended Homelessness for One Million Americans","WASHINGTON - Today, U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Shaun Donovan announced that homelessness for 1 million Americans was prevented or ended, thanks to HUD's Homelessness Prevention and Rapid Re-housing Program (HPRP), funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Secretary Donovan made this announcement at a U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness meeting with U.S. Department of Labor Secretary Hilda Solis, who serves as the USICH Chair; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and USICH Vice Chair Kathleen Sebelius, U.S. Veteran's Administration Secretary Eric Shinseki, D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray, and USICH Director Barbara Poppe.

As a new program created specifically under the Recovery Act, HPRP provided $1.5 billion to local communities to keep families in their homes or help them find other affordable housing after a sudden financial crisis, which might have otherwise led to homelessness. These grants offer communities a resource to provide short- and medium-term rental assistance and services to prevent individuals and families from becoming homeless or to quickly re-house those who are experiencing homelessness.
""At a time when so many families were at the brink of homelessness due to the economic crisis, HPRP was able to step in and provide the assistance needed to keep families safe and off the streets,"" said Secretary Donovan. ""I am proud to announce this historic milestone and to continue to work on strategies with my partners within the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness to end homelessness for all Americans.""
Grants provided under HPRP are not intended to provide long-term support for individuals and families, nor do they provide mortgage assistance to homeowners facing foreclosure. Rather, HPRP offers short- and medium-term financial assistance and services to those who would otherwise become homeless, and those who are already in homeless shelters or living on the street, many due to sudden economic crisis. This can include short-term rental assistance (up to three months), medium-term rental assistance (up to 18 months), security deposits, utility deposits and/or utility payments, moving cost assistance, and hotel vouchers. Payments will not be made directly to households, but only to third parties, such as landlords or utility companies.
The goal of the program is to increase housing stability for those individuals and families served with HPRP assistance. HUD requires each grantee to participate in its local Homeless Management Information System (HMIS), where client-level data is entered and collected on the households served through HPRP on a quarterly basis. The grantee and/or subgrantee compiles the reported data and provides HUD with an unduplicated count of person and households served in the reporting quarter and date, as well as whether the household exited the program to stable housing. On an annual basis, HUD captures additional detailed data from the grantees that is published in the Annual Homelessness Assessment Report.
Also, last year 19 federal agencies in the Obama Administration announced a plan to end all homelessness through,Opening Doors, an unprecedented federal strategy to end veteran and chronic homelessness by 2015, and to end homelessness among children, families, and youth by 2020. In addition to the HPRP grant program, last month HUD announced that it would award $1.63 billion to support nearly 7,000 existing homeless assistance programs currently operating and create additional new homeless assistance programs with the Continuum of Care (CoC) Homeless Assistance Program Notice of Funding Availability for fiscal year 2011, which is making a major contribution to the Opening Doors strategy.
Secretary Donovan and the Department are committed to providing the highest level of transparency possible as Recovery Act funds are administered. It is vitally important that the American people are fully aware of how their tax dollars are being spent and can hold their federal leaders accountable. Every dollar of Recovery Act funds HUD spends can be reviewed and tracked at HUD's Recovery Act website. The full text of HUD's funding notices and tracking of future performance of these grants is also available at HUD's Recovery Act website."

09/14/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-210.cfm,"HUD Awards Nearly $100 Million to Promote Jobs, Self-Sufficiency, Independent Living for HUD-Assisted Housing Residents","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today awarded nearly $100 million in grants to help public and assisted housing residents find employment; connect with needed services; and help the elderly and people with disabilities maintain independent living. The funding also allows the grantees to retain or hire ""service coordinators"" or case workers to work directly with these HUD-assisted families to connect them to the supportive services that meet their individual needs. Read more about local impact of HUD's grant funding.
The funding announced today includes: Approximately $35 million through the Resident Opportunities and Self Sufficiency - Service Coordinators Program (ROSS-SC) Program; approximately $15 million through the Public Housing - Family Self-Sufficiency Program (PH-FSS); and $45 million through the Multifamily Housing Service Coordinator Program (MHSC).
""Providing housing assistance alone is often not enough to help individuals increase their independence,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""The service coordinators funded through these programs open doors that help HUD-assisted families find jobs, access services and assist the elderly and disabled to continue living as independently as possible in their homes.""
The ROSS-SC and PH-FSS programs allow grantees across the U.S. hire or retain service coordinators to work directly with residents to assess their needs to connect them with education, job training and placement programs and/or computer and financial literacy services available in their community to promote self-sufficiency. Only public housing authorities are eligible for PH-FSS grants. ROSS-SC grants can be awarded to public housing authorities, resident associations and non-profit organizations. Grantees that receive ROSS-SC grants can also use the funding for this purpose, which allows the elderly or persons with disabilities who live in public housing to maintain their independent lifestyle.
In a similar fashion, the MHSC program provides funding to owners of private housing developments under contract from HUD to house low-income individuals. These owners, or their management companies, hire or contract service coordinators with backgrounds in providing social services, especially to the elderly and people with disabilities, to assist their residents with special needs.
Combined, HUD estimates this funding will allow the grantees to hire new employees or retain approximately 650 service coordinators that are currently working with HUD-assisted individuals. The purpose of the ROSS-SC and PH-FSS programs is to encourage local, innovative strategies that link public housing assistance with public and private resources to enable participating families to increase earned income; reduce or eliminate the need for welfare assistance; and make progress toward achieving economic independence and housing self-sufficiency.
Public housing residents who participate in the PH-FSS program sign a contract with the housing authority, which outlines their responsibilities towards completion of training and employment objectives over a five-year period. For those families receiving welfare assistance, the housing authority must establish an interim goal that the participating family be independent from welfare assistance prior to the expiration of the contract. During their participation, residents may create an escrow account funded with their increasing income, which they may use in a variety of ways, including continuing their education or making major purchase.
HUD's Family Self Sufficiency (FSS) Program is a long-standing resource for increasing economic security and self-sufficiency among participants. HUD issued a new report (www.huduser.org/portal/publications/affhsg/eval_fssp.html)earlier this year that evaluated the effectiveness of the FSS Program. Conducted from 2005 to 2009, the study shows the financial benefits are substantial for participants who remain and complete the program. This study is the second of a three-part series by HUD that evaluate the effects of the FSS program. The first study (www.huduser.org/portal/publications/econdev/selfsufficiency.html) found individuals who participated in the FSS program fared better financially than those who did not enroll in the program. HUD's Office of Policy Development and Research (PD&R) will launch the third and final installment to complete the series this year.
The MFSC program allows multifamily housing owners to assist elderly individuals and nonelderly people with disabilities living in HUD-assisted housing and in the surrounding area to obtain needed supportive services from the community, to enable them to continue living independently. The grants are awarded for an initial three-year period to eligible owners of multifamily housing for the elderly or disabled, to enable them to hire and support a service coordinator. The funds cover such costs as salary, fringe benefits, quality assurance, training, office space, equipment, and other related administrative expenses. A report (www.huduser.org/portal/periodicals/ResearchWorks/june_09/RW_vol6num6t2.html) HUD released in 2009 noted that aging in place reduces rates of premature institutionalization for low-income elderly residents, thus reducing the costs borne by taxpayers."

09/14/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-223.cfm,"U.S. Department of the Treasury, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Ad Council Launch New PSAS to Prompt Homeowners Who Are Facing Mortgage Trouble to Reach Out for Help","WASHINGTON - The Ad Council, in partnership with the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), have joined together to launch a new phase of their Foreclosure Prevention Assistance Public Service Advertising (PSA) Campaign. The campaign aims to increase awareness of the Making Home Affordable® Program's free resources and assistance for homeowners who are struggling with their mortgage payments.
One in 11 homeowners nationwide has missed two or more mortgage payments. Many struggling homeowners delay conversations about their mortgage concerns and enter foreclosure without ever reaching out for assistance. The new PSAs notify homeowners facing mortgage trouble that options other than foreclosure are available, and the sooner they act, the more options they have for the best possible outcome.
The Foreclosure Prevention Assistance campaign encourages homeowners to call 888-995-HOPE (4673) to speak one-on-one with a HUD-approved housing expert to discuss the solutions that are available based on their individual circumstances. In addition, the program website, MakingHomeAffordable.gov, serves as an online resource for struggling homeowners to learn about options other than foreclosure.
Created pro bono by Schafer Condon Carter, a Chicago-based advertising agency, the new television, radio, print, out of home, and online PSAs have been created in English and Spanish. The PSAs aim to inspire homeowners who are unsure of where to turn to reach out for help as soon as possible.
""The Making Home Affordable Program has already assisted over a million homeowners,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""Housing counselors are ready to continue their work with homeowners to discuss specific solutions for their mortgage problems. Struggling homeowners do not need to work through their concerns alone. The key is encouraging homeowners to pick up the phone now to explore their options.""
Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner added: ""While the housing market is still distressed, the Administration's programs have helped establish better standards for the mortgage industry. As a result, struggling homeowners have more options today than ever before. We are continuing to do everything we can to help stabilize the market and to ease the burden on struggling homeowners. And that includes working to make sure families and individuals know about the resources available to them.""
""We are proud to continue our partnership with Treasury and HUD on this critical issue of home foreclosures that affects so many Americans,"" said Peggy Conlon, president and CEO, the Ad Council. ""We are confident that these new PSAs will resonate with homeowners struggling with their mortgages and encourage them to call 888-995-HOPE or visit the website to learn what they can do to prevent foreclosure.""
""All of us at Schafer Condon Carter have been honored to work with the Ad Council and its sponsors at Treasury and HUD on the Making Home Affordable campaign,"" said David Selby, president of Schafer Condon Carter. ""We know that the financial burdens currently facing many homeowners are paralyzing. We've captured this emotion with a creative treatment that shows people frozen in time while the world goes on around them. Speaking directly to these homeowners is key in getting them to get the help they need as soon as possible.""
The Ad Council will distribute the new PSAs to more than 33,000 media outlets nationwide. The new advertisements build on the successful nationwide campaign first launched between Treasury, HUD and the Ad Council in the summer of 2010. The PSAs will air in advertising space donated by the media.

09/15/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-205.cfm,HUD Awards $93 Million in Grants to Protect Thousands of Children from Lead and Other Home Hazards,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Dept. of Housing and Urban Development today awarded $93 million in grants to 39 local projects to conduct a wide range of activities intended to protect children and families from potentially dangerous lead-based paint and other home health and safety hazards. Read a complete project-by-project summary of the programs awarded grants today.
The grant funding announced today will clean up lead and other health hazards in nearly 7,000 high-risk homes, train workers in lead safety methods, and increase public awareness about childhood lead poisoning. Lead is a known toxin that can impair children's development and have effects lasting into adulthood.
""Protecting the health and well-being of children is a top priority for HUD. We know that housing conditions directly affect the health of its occupants,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""These grants will help communities around the nation to protect families from lead exposure and other significant health and safety hazards.""
With these grant awards, HUD makes it clear that providing healthy and safe homes for families and children is a priority. It's simple: you can't be healthy if your home is sick. HUD is committed to protecting children from these hazards, as part of the Department's effort to help make the nation's housing healthy and sustainable. Along with lead hazard control work, HUD is awarding funds to promote and develop programs to identify and address multiple housing-related health hazards with lead hazard control intervention work.
Through its grant programs, HUD's Office of Healthy Homes and Lead Hazard Control promotes local efforts to eliminate dangerous lead hazards from lower income homes; stimulates private sector investment in lead hazard control; and educates the public about the dangers of lead-based paint.
Lead Hazard Control Grant Programs
Even though lead-based paint was banned for residential use in 1978, HUD estimates that approximately 24 million homes still have significant lead-based paint hazards today. Lead-contaminated dust is the primary cause of lead exposure and can lead to a variety of health problems in young children, including reduced IQ, learning disabilities, developmental delays, reduced height, and impaired hearing. At higher levels, lead can damage a child's kidneys and central nervous system and cause anemia, coma, convulsions and even death.
The funding announced today directs critical funds to cities, counties and states to eliminate dangerous lead paint hazards in thousands of privately-owned, low-income housing units. These funds are provided through HUD's Lead-Based Paint Hazard Control and Lead Hazard Reduction Demonstration grant programs. To expand the reach of HUD's Lead Hazard Control Program, more than $4 million of this funding will support new grantees. HUD is also providing nearly $2.3 million to help communities transform their lead hazard control programs to address multiple housing-related hazards.
The following is a state-by-state breakdown of the funding announced today:"
09/15/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-216.cfm,CPSC Completes Final Studies to Help Affected Homeowners Remediate Problem Drywall,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today released updated remediation guidance for homeowners with problem drywall. The guidance calls for the replacement of all: problem drywall; smoke and carbon monoxide (CO) alarms; electrical distribution components, including receptacles, switches and circuit breakers, but not necessarily wiring; and fusible-type fire sprinkler heads.
The updated remediation guidance is based on studies just completed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) on potential long term corrosion effects of problem drywall on select gas components, fire sprinkler heads and smoke alarms.
CPSC and HUD staffs believe these final studies that resulted in an update of the remediation guidance, along with previously-issued identification guidance, will enable homeowners to comprehensively remediate those homes containing problem drywall with potentially lower costs than by following the previous remediation guidance.
KEY FINDINGS
The key finding is that none of the studies performed at NIST on smoke alarms, fire sprinkler heads, or gas service piping found corrosion associated with problem drywall that provided evidence of a substantial product safety hazard, as defined by the Consumer Product Safety Act. Corrosion of gas service piping was uniform and minimal compared to the thickness of pipes. Some smoke alarms and fire sprinkler heads showed small changes in performance due to accelerated corrosion, but these changes were generally within accepted industry standards.
As a result, CPSC and HUD no longer recommend the removal of gas service piping in homes with problem drywall. This change may reduce the cost of remediation for many homes. In addition, the agencies no longer recommend that glass bulb fire sprinkler heads be replaced in homes. However, the agencies recommend that both glass bulb sprinkler heads and gas distribution piping in affected homes be inspected and tested as part of the remediation to make sure they are working properly; any test failures should be corrected according to all applicable building codes.
The agencies do recommend the replacement of all fusible-type fire sprinkler heads, because one fusible-type sprinkler head sample that had been exposed to accelerated corrosion did not activate when tested. The agencies note that this type of sprinkler head is generally found in commercial, rather than residential, applications and that the sole failure could not be causally linked to the problem drywall.
In addition, CPSC staff continues to recommend that homeowners replace smoke alarms and carbon monoxide alarms as part of remediation.
EXHAUSTIVE INVESTIGATION
CPSC's investigation into problem drywall to help affected homeowners began in early 2009 and involved significant agency resources. CPSC's investigation of problem drywall has been driven by sound science and has involved HUD, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as members of the Federal Interagency Task Force on Problem Drywall.
CPSC and HUD met with deeply-impacted homeowners, responded to correspondence, and kept members of Congress informed about our progress during this time period.
CPSC developed contracts to research and test problem drywall, visited Chinese mines and manufacturers, hosted a public website to keep the public informed about new developments, and devoted thousands of staff hours and millions of dollars to these activities.
As part of the effort to determine if there were any health or safety effects associated with problem drywall, the agency contracted with several highly-respected technical organizations, including Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Environmental Health & Engineering Inc. (EH&E), Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), NIST, and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).
LBNL used specially-built chambers to measure chemical emissions from drywall samples. In the second phase of its work, which is being released today, LBNL evaluated the effects of different temperature and humidity conditions, as well as the effects of time and coatings of paint or plaster, on the emissions. A prior LBNL study found considerably higher hydrogen sulfide emission rates from some, but not all, Chinese drywall samples compared to North American samples. The current LBNL study found that increases in temperature and humidity corresponded with increased emission rates of the most reactive sulfur gases, that emissions were significantly reduced over time (compared with its prior testing), and that coating the problem drywall samples did not result in differences in emissions compared to uncoated samples.
EH&E conducted CPSC's 51-home study on emissions and corrosion in problem drywall homes. The studies identified elevated levels of hydrogen sulfide in problem drywall homes. The studies also showed a strong association between the presence of hydrogen sulfide and metal corrosion in the problem drywall homes.
SNL exposed smoke alarms, electrical components, gas piping, and sprinkler heads to concentrated levels of gases representative of problem drywall emissions, to simulate decades of exposure. SNL analyzed the effects of corrosion on the electrical components and found no degradation in performance and no acute safety events during testing.
NIST analyzed the type and depth of corrosion resulting from the simulated aging, as well as other samples taken from homes with problem drywall, and evaluated whether the corrosion would impact the proper functioning of smoke alarms, gas distribution piping, and fire sprinklers.
Another study being released today, that was conducted by the USGS, found no evidence of microbiological activity or a microbiological source of sulfur-gas emissions from gypsum rock or problem drywall, including samples taken from affected homes .
As part of the investigation, CPSC requested that CDC consider undertaking a comprehensive study of any possible long-term health effects. In February 2011, CDC indicated that the best scientific evidence available at that time did not support undertaking a long-term health study.
CONCLUDING OUR INVESTIGATION
To date, CPSC has received 3,905 reports from residents of 42 states and the District of Columbia, American Samoa, and Puerto Rico, who believe their health symptoms or the corrosion of certain metal components in their homes are related to problem drywall. CPSC believes there may be as many as 6,300 U.S. homes with problem drywall.
CPSC has been focused on providing answers and guidance for homeowners based on its scientific work, and other federal agencies have worked to provide relief to homeowners. For example, based on information provided by CPSC, the IRS allows certain impacted taxpayers whose homes meet the CPSC's problem drywall identification criteria to treat damages from corrosive drywall as a casualty loss, and provides a ""safe harbor"" formula for determining the amount of the loss. In addition, HUD advised its Federal Housing Administration-approved mortgage lenders that they may offer forbearance for borrowers confronted with the sudden effects of damaging drywall in their homes.
Going forward, CPSC staff continues to work with voluntary standards organizations to develop improved standards for drywall to prevent this type of problem from reemerging. The standard setting body ASTM International Inc. is also moving to require that all drywall sheets are marked with the manufacturer's name or a unique identification code, the manufacture date, and the source materials.
As the federal investigation into problem drywall concludes, CPSC staff believes that the extensive research and testing have been successful in defining the scope of the problem drywall issue, in producing identification and remediation protocols, and in providing homeowners with all the assistance possible within the agency's jurisdiction and appropriated funds authority. The agency will continue to provide information to and work with members of Congress and agency partners to support policy options that may be beneficial to impacted homeowners.

09/19/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-222.cfm,HUD Awards $8.3 Million to Native American Communities for Housing and Economic Development for Low-Income Families,"WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development awarded more than $8.3 million in grants to tribal communities in nine states to improve or create housing and economic development opportunities for low- to moderate-income families. The competitive grants are provided through HUD's Indian Community Development Block Grant (ICDBG) Program to support a wide variety of community development and affordable housing activities.
""These funds will help American Indian and Alaska Native tribal governments create sustainable and community-driven solutions,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""Housing and infrastructure needs in Indian Country are severe and widespread. I'm inspired by the work the tribal communities are taking on to leverage these funds and get their communities on the right track.""
For example, the native village of Kwinhagak in Alaska will expand its stock of energy-efficient, Arctic-appropriate housing, using both modern and native building technologies. Comanche Nation Housing Authority of Oklahoma will rehab more than two dozen houses for families currently living in substandard homes, including new roofs, doors, windows, insulation, electrical system and plumbing repairs, siding, flooring, cabinets and counters, and HVAC upgrades. In White Earth, New Mexico, a new 12,800-square-foot Workforce Development Center will provide workforce skills and vocational training to assist tribal members in obtaining employment.
In California, the Quechan Tribe will improve roads and sidewalks in a neighborhood with predominantly low and very-low income families with high amounts of foot traffic. In California, the Yurok Reservation will get multipurpose park and recreation facility. In Montana, families at the Mutual Help project in Northern Cheyenne will have their homes rehabbed to reduce the amount of substandard housing in the community.
The ICDBG program was established in 1977 to help Indian tribes and Alaska Native villages to meet their community development needs. Federally recognized Indian tribes, bands, groups or nations (including Alaska Indian, Aleuts and Eskimos,) or Alaska Native villages compete for this funding. The recipients use the funding to develop viable communities, including rehabilitating housing or building new housing or to buy land to support new housing construction.
The funding can also be used to build infrastructure such as roads, water and sewer facilities, and to create suitable living environments. To spur economic development, recipients have used the grants to establish a wide variety of commercial, industrial and agricultural projects. The grants have been used to build community and health centers, or to start businesses to support the community, such as shopping centers, manufacturing plants, restaurants or convenient stores/gas stations."

09/21/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-225.cfm,HUD Awards $8.8 Million to Improve Housing and Services for Families and Individuals Living with AIDS,"WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development awarded nearly $9 million to projects in seven cities and states that will offer permanent and transitional housing and support services to more than 200 households with families and individuals living with HIV/AIDS. Provided through HUD's Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) Program, these projects will also develop new cross program approaches in HIV care by creating an Integrated HIV/AIDS Housing Plan in their communities.
""These resources will allow public agencies, nonprofits and housing authorities to forge new partnerships so that together, we can deliver comprehensive housing solutions and services for low-income families dealing with HIV,"" HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan said. ""These communities will be innovating to more effectively and efficiently assist vulnerable households with HIV and serve as models for others to improve health outcomes and reduce risks of homelessness.""
HUD's grant funding will support the following cities and organizations: (see project-by-project summaries below.)
In collaboration with other parties, these groups will offer supportive housing over the next three years to 208 households. Grants funded under this initiative advance HUD's implementation of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy (NHAS) (http://aids.gov/federal-resources/policies/national-hiv-aids-strategy/) and will demonstrate models for a next generation of improved coordination of housing and care for a vulnerable population. This better integration of housing support will also help achieve the Obama Administration's Opening Doors Strategy (www.usich.gov/PDF/OpeningDoors_2010_FSPPreventEndHomeless.pdf) to prevent and end homelessness.
The seven projects were selected through a national HOPWA competition to identify Special Projects of National Significance that will help advance understanding and improve the delivery of housing and care for persons with HIV. HUD received 46 proposals under this competition. The projects will provide housing assistance to eligible persons in their communities during the next three years. Planning efforts will also concurrently examine new approaches for comprehensively integrating local services and in coordinating and streamlining where possible the delivery of those services in their community."
09/22/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-226.cfm,HUD and National Association of Real Estate Brokers Form Partnership to Promote Fair Housing,"WASHINGTON - In an effort to end discriminatory treatment African Americans and other people of color often experience, HUD and the National Association of Real Estate Brokers (NAREB) today announced a new partnership to work together to promote fair housing in minority communities. In Fiscal Year 2010, 27.8% (2,820) of the 10,157 fair housing complaints HUD and its fair housing partner agencies received alleged race discrimination against blacks. At the same time, a recent HUD report showed that the nation's ""worst case housing needs"" increased by 3.2 percentage points among African American families.
The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) HUD and NAREB signed will help end discrimination by informing consumers in African American and other minority communities and public and private industry members about their fair housing rights and responsibilities under the Fair Housing Act.
""This partnership advances HUD's and NAREB's joint vision and commitment to end housing discrimination,"" said John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity (FHEO). ""We have turned to the nation's oldest minority real estate trade association to bring our message of fair housing education and enforcement to neighborhoods across America. With NAREB, we also promote industry compliance and a better consumer service.""
""NAREB has fought the battle over the last 64 years to make sure that people of all colors have access to fair and equal opportunities in housing, which we believe is in the forefront of what America represents,"" said Julius Cartwright, president of the National Association of Real Estate Brokers. ""We are extremely proud to partner with and have the additional reinforcement of HUD on this very important initiative designed to preserve and stabilize minority neighborhoods and communities across the United States.""
Under the MOU, HUD and NAREB will conduct joint seminars, workshops, and forums on ways to identify unlawful sales, rental and lending and related government contracting discrimination. Additionally, they will work together to educate people in all communities about their fair housing and related government contracting rights and avenues available to them should they experience discrimination.
Furthermore, NAREB will emphasize the importance of fair housing and equal opportunity to real estate professionals as well as work with other organizations and institutions in African American communities, including faith-based groups, government agencies.
NAREB, the oldest minority real estate trade association in America, was founded to create equal housing and government contracting opportunities for every resident of the nation, regardless of race, creed, or color. Its 18,000 members, 12 regional offices, and 92 chapters work to help stabilize the nation's housing and urban community real estate markets, expand consumer protections, and stop the spiral of urban decay and foreclosure-related losses in minority communities.
FHEO and its partners in the Fair Housing Assistance Program investigate more than 10,000 housing discrimination complaints annually. People who believe they are the victims of housing discrimination should contact HUD at 1-800-669-9777 (voice), (800) 927-9275 (TTY)."
09/22/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-227.cfm,"HUD Awards Nearly $60 Million to Help Low-Income Families Receive Job Training, Employment","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today awarded nearly $60 million to help public housing agencies across the U.S., the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico to retain or hire service coordinators to work directly with families who participate in HUD's Housing Choice Voucher program. The coordinators will assist these voucher recipients to find employment resources and job training opportunities to put them on a path toward self-sufficiency. Read more about local impact of HUD's grant funding.
""In today's economy, it's never been more critical to help families obtain the skills that lead to jobs,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""With HUD's help, these housing authorities will be able to assist families in finding employment, increasing their earning potential and putting them on a path to self sufficiency.""
HUD's Housing Choice Voucher Family Self-Sufficiency Program (HCV/FSS) supports public housing agencies (PHAs) to retain or hire family self-sufficiency coordinators. These coordinators in turn link adults in the HCV program with welfare agencies, schools, businesses and other local partners to develop the skills and experience to enable them to obtain jobs that pay a living wage. The local organizations typically provide participating individuals job training, childcare, counseling, transportation, job placement and homeownership counseling.
Participants in the HCV-FSS program sign a contract that requires the head of the household will get a job and the family will no longer receive welfare assistance at the end of the five-year term. As the family's income rises, a portion of that increased income is deposited in an interest-bearing escrow account. If the family completes its FSS contract, the family receives the escrow funds that it can use for any purpose, including a down payment on a home, paying educational expenses, starting a business or paying back debts.
HUD's Family Self Sufficiency (FSS) Program is a long-standing resource for increasing economic security and self-sufficiency among participants. HUD issued a new report (www.huduser.org/portal/publications/affhsg/eval_fssp.html) earlier this year that evaluated the effectiveness of the FSS Program. Conducted from 2005 to 2009, the study shows the financial benefits are substantial for participants who complete the program. This study is the second of a three-part series by HUD that evaluate the effects of the FSS program. The first study (www.huduser.org/portal/publications/econdev/selfsufficiency.html) found individuals who participated in the FSS program fared better financially than those who did not enroll in the program. HUD's Office of Policy Development and Research (PD&R) will launch the third and final installment to complete the series this year."
09/23/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-228.cfm,HUD Charges Wisconsin Landlord with Refusing to Rent to African American Couple,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has charged a La Crosse, Wisconsin landlord with violating the Fair Housing Act for refusing to rent an apartment to an African American couple because of their race. HUD brings the charge on behalf of the couple, alleging that Geneva Terrace, Inc. and Victoria Gerrard, the owner of Geneva Terrace Apartments, and property manager Nicolai Quinn refused to show an apartment to the complainants. Additionally, they falsely represented to the couple and other black applicants that no units were available, while informing white applicants of available units and encouraging them to apply.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing discrimination based on race.
""Fairness dictates, and the Fair Housing Act requires, that housing providers not use race to deny anyone their housing choice,"" stated John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""While it's appalling that such discrimination still occurs in America today, HUD is there to counter it whenever it happens.""
According to HUD's charge, the husband of the couple called to inquire about renting a two-bedroom apartment after a white friend, who once lived at Geneva Terrace, recommended it to him. The husband spoke to Quinn, who told him that there was no apartment available at the time. The couple made several more inquiries over the next few months after noticing newspaper advertisements for apartments at the property and seeing a ""Now Renting"" sign outside the property. With each inquiry, Quinn allegedly told the couple that there were no vacancies. When a white friend of the couple called to inquire about apartments, however, Quinn told the white woman that a two-bedroom unit was available and offered to show it to her just fifteen minutes after he told the wife that there was no unit available.
The couple reported their experience to the Metropolitan Milwaukee Fair Housing Council, which initiated telephone and in-person testing at the building. The charge alleges that over a period of two months, the Council sent black and white testers to make inquiries about the availability of two-bedroom apartments at the complex. Quinn repeatedly told the black testers that there were no vacancies, while inviting white testers to view the apartments.
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that illegal discrimination has occurred, he may award monetary damages to the couple and their minor child.
The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief to deter further discrimination, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose fines in order to vindicate the public interest. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages to aggrieved persons.
FHEO and its partners in the Fair Housing Assistance Program investigate more than 10,000 housing discrimination complaints annually. People who believe they are the victims of housing discrimination should contact HUD at 1-800-669-9777 (voice), (800) 927-9275 (TTY)."
09/23/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-229.cfm,"HUD's New Edition of Evidence Matters, a Quarterly Publication on Research-Based Policy, Focuses on Sustainability","WASHINGTON - The summer edition of Evidence Matters (www.huduser.org/portal/evidence.html), HUD's quarterly publication that informs the public on issues related to housing and community development, is available today. This issue focuses on strengthening the evidence behind sustainability, a concept that while embraced by many businesses, government and families, still faces some skeptics.
""If we want sustainable policies and behaviors to be more widely adopted, advocacy is not enough. The justification for sustainability must be self-evident to everyone,"" said Raphael Bostic, HUD Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research. ""HUD has made sustainability one of its key strategic goals. This edition of Evidence Matters helps build the knowledge base necessary to foster private investment in technologies that make our homes and communities more sustainable.""
Reducing home energy consumption, which accounts for 22 percent of U.S. energy consumption, is key. The magazine's lead article, Quantifying Energy Efficiency in Multifamily Rental Housing, focuses on the sluggish pace of energy-efficiency improvements in the multifamily rental housing sector, an issue that continues to vex advocates of sustainability. The article looks at steps being taken to resolve these challenges, including efforts by HUD and its partners to increase and standardize the data on the impacts of retrofits.
In another feature, Measuring Sustainability, the authors review how sustainability has been defined and measured during its brief history, and how fast-moving advances in the field are allowing governments, businesses and individuals to look at it in a new and more comprehensive manner. For example, location efficiency is a thriving area of research regarding metrics because it ties together the travel and economic impacts of projects.
The article Confronting the Future: Case Studies in Regional Planning and Consensus-Building describes the techniques used by regional planning organizations in Salt Lake City and Sacramento to build strong and broad support for their sustainability initiatives. Their examples show how solid, credible data, combined with the ability to connect the data to people's values, go a long way.
In an effort to promote a new generation of data-driven and evidence-based policymaking, HUD's Office of Policy Development and Research launched Evidence Matters in February. It is a quarterly publication intended to inform housing and community development advocates, state and local policymakers, Congress and researchers on new approaches to issues related to housing and community development. Evidence Matters is an objective, unbiased publication intended to inform the broad housing and community development field on future policy directions based on research and data - in short, the evidence."

The grant is provided through HUD's HOPE VI Main Street Program that gives financial support to small towns to ensure they have the resources to include affordable housing in their ongoing effort to revitalize older, downtown business districts.
""HUD is delighted to have a role in bringing El Dorado's downtown back to life,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""This funding will create jobs and allow the city to include affordable housing into the efforts to rejuvenate the town center.""
El Dorado will use the funding to transform Ellet's Opera House and the Gish Building into affordable housing. Two developers - Gish Apartments, LLC and W&M Enterprises, LLC - formed WMS Partnership. The new entity will join the city and PKHLS Architects to oversee and design the construction of the new housing.
The project will create 12-upper-story, affordable one and two-bedroom housing units. Ten of the units will be reserved for low- to moderate-income residents. The remaining two units, one in each building, will be reserved for very low-income residents. The revitalization plan will upgrade the interior of each building, but maintain the historical integrity of the two sites. The partners also plan to incorporate Energy Star components, including installing - energy efficient windows; refurbishing original doors that will be Energy Star rated; installing high efficiency Energy Star rated appliances such as refrigerators, stoves, ovens, water heaters, heating and air systems, and washers/dryers.
Amenities in the opera house will include storage units, a common laundry facility, and an accessible elevator. Also, the YMCA, Salvation Army, and farmer's market are in close proximity to the project site. Although the first floor of the opera house has remained occupied, the second floor has been vacant for decades and was formerly used as a performance hall. The city will use other funding sources to remodel the first floor of the opera house for 5,000 square feet of commercial and retail space."
09/26/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-232.cfm,HUD Charges Washington State Property Owner with Disability Discrimination,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced that it has charged the owner and manager of a Lakewood, Washington trailer park with discriminating on the basis of disability. HUD brings the charge on behalf of the Fair Housing Center of Washington, alleging that Deidra Miller, the owner of Terrace Trailers, and property manager Claudia Welch refused to make a reasonable accommodation to their ""no pets"" policy for testers posing as applicants with disabilities who needed service dogs.
The Fair Housing Act requires landlords to make reasonable accommodations in their rules or policies if necessary to afford equal housing opportunities to persons with disabilities.
""The Fair Housing Act requires that landlords honor requests for animals like service dogs if a person with a disability requires that dog for daily life activities,"" said John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""In these cases, people with disabilities are not seeking special treatment; they are seeking the equal opportunity to enjoy their dwelling just as anyone else can.""
According to HUD's charge, the Fair Housing Center of Washington (FHCW), a local non-profit organization, initiated testing after seeing an advertisement for a rental unit at Terrace Trailers indicating a ""no pets"" policy during a random audit of online rental postings. The craigslist.com ad provided Welch's and Miller's names and telephone numbers. Testers posing as persons requiring service dogs called the numbers provided to inquire about the advertised rentals. In two separate tests, Welch told the testers that animals were not allowed even after the testers explained that their dogs were service animals. After checking with Miller, Welch confirmed to the second tester that Miller would not make a reasonable accommodation to allow the service dog. Welch allegedly told the testers that if their service animals were permitted, ""then everyone will want one.""
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that illegal discrimination has occurred, he may award monetary damages to the Fair Housing Center.
The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief to deter further discrimination, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose fines in order to vindicate the public interest. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages to aggrieved persons."

The ""Commitment to Action"" was announced at the CGI annual meeting in New York City. Known as Innovation 10 Thousand or ""I-10-K"" (www.clintonglobalinitiative.org/commitments/commitments_search.asp?id=732504%20.), this CGI commitment and the supporting partnership have been crafted to develop a replicable platform to engage sustainable development innovators towards the goal of creating new housing and employment opportunities in urban locations. I-10-K is a unique collaboration between HUD, the U.S. Department of State, American Planning Association, Context Partners, X PRIZE Foundation, Rockefeller Foundation, Un Techo Para Mi País, and Ashoka's Changemakers. The partners conceived of using competitions as a way of advancing housing and urban development innovations across public, private and nonprofit sectors. President Clinton has stated that he believes CGI can lift up and standardize such models, ultimately creating solutions for social and economic mega-challenges.
""Through this commitment at CGI, HUD continues to work toward being a world leader in the development of sustainable communities. This partnership reflects an ongoing desire to engage sustainable development innovators from throughout the world, with the goal of creating new, cutting edge, high quality urban housing and employment opportunities,"" said Dr. Raphael Bostic, HUD Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research.
The need for sustainable communities throughout the world has never been greater, as half of the world's population lives in urban areas and, according to the United Nations, it is projected that by 2050, three out of four people in the world will live in cities. HUD's Office for International and Philanthropic Innovation and Office of Sustainable Housing and Communities came together with the State Department and its partners to create new ways of finding innovations, sharing them on a global stage and influencing U.S. domestic products, policies and processes for creating livable, inclusive and sustainable communities.
Building on the success of the recent Sustainable Urban Housing: Collaborating for Livable and Inclusive Cities competition, ""I-10-K"" will further lift sustainable housing and urban development innovations in three ways: 1) A competition model for sourcing large-scale, multi-location sustainable housing solutions; 2) an in-country training and technical assistance program for innovators and their partners; and 3) an online community to further deepen collaboration and to continually engage new partners. This commitment focuses on using housing as a platform for creating inclusive and sustainable urban communities and will surface innovations to guide domestic housing and urban development policies.

09/27/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-235.cfm,HUD Charges Massachusetts Landlord with Discriminating Against Families with Children,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is charging Craig Robbins, a Springfield, Massachusetts landlord, with violating the Fair Housing Act for allegedly refusing to rent or show an apartment to families with children because he claimed he did not have certification that the apartment was free of lead-based paint.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits landlords from discriminating against families with children. Except where housing satisfies the Act's ""housing for older persons"" exemption, property owners may not indicate a preference against families with children in advertising, or discourage families with children from applying for housing.
""Landlords must disclose the presence of lead paint in housing units and, under Massachusetts law must remove it. They may not, however, use the existence of lead paint as an excuse not to rent to families with children,"" said John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity.
According to HUD's charge, Robbins first advertised the available one-bedroom apartment on craigslist.org, stating a preference for ""working singles/college grad."" In response to the ad, the Housing Discrimination Project, a HUD-supported fair housing group, sent in testers to determine whether Robbins was discriminating against families with children. The testers found that when they called to ask about the advertised apartment, Robbins repeatedly refused to show the unit once he learned that young children would also be occupying the apartment, claiming he did not have a ""lead free certificate."" When asked if he would consider obtaining a certificate, Robbins refused, and in one case, allegedly hung up the phone.
HUD, in publicly-released guidance on the investigation of Fair Housing Act cases and in the preamble (www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-1999-09-15/pdf/99-23016.pdf#page=19) to a 1999 regulation on lead-based hazards, makes clear that using the presence of lead-based paint as an excuse to refuse to rent to families with children is illegal. While a property owner may tell families of the danger of moving into a unit that has not been remediated for lead paint, an owner may not refuse to allow a family to occupy the unit because of the presence of a child.
The HUD Charge of Discrimination will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that illegal discrimination has occurred, the judge may award monetary damages to aggrieved persons for the harm they were caused by the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive and other equitable relief to deter further discrimination, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose fines in order to vindicate the public interest. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages to aggrieved persons.

These awards support local organizations serving diverse communities across the country that will help ensure persons who are limited English proficient (LEP) have access to information in their native languages on HUD housing, programs, services, and activities.
""Partnering with organizations that work directly with limited English proficient persons helps HUD provide more effective and efficient services to people who are limited English proficient,"" said John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""How well people speak English must not determine their access to safe, affordable, and decent housing free from discrimination.

The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) offers a Limited English Proficiency website to promote equal access to housing programs by providing important HUD documents in 12 different languages. HUD's expanded Limited English Proficiency (LEP) website features factsheets, housing brochures and other forms in Amharic, Arabic, Armenian, Cambodian, Chinese, Farsi, French, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, Tagalog, and Vietnamese in addition to English. The site offers brochures on fair housing, model lease agreements, information about HUD's Housing Choice Voucher Program (Section 8), and Resident Rights and Responsibilities.
The LEP initiative is in response to Executive Order 13166, which requires all federal, local and state agencies that receive federal funding to ensure that people with limited language skills have meaningful access to government programs and services."

HUD brings the charge on behalf of the tenants, alleging that the DeAngeli Family Trust and Peter DeAngeli, the respective owner and landlord of the property, engaged in unlawful discrimination by refusing to make a reasonable accommodation to the building's ""no pets policy"" for a person with a disability. HUD also alleges the housing providers retaliated against the tenants by evicting them when they protested the housing providers' refusal to grant the accommodation.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful for a housing provider to refuse a reasonable accommodation in its rules, policies, practices, or services when needed to provide persons with disabilities an equal opportunity to use or enjoy a dwelling. It is also against the law to threaten or intimidate residents, including evicting them, for exercising their fair housing rights.
""The Fair Housing Act protects individuals from discrimination because of their disabilities or those of their guests,"" said John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will enforce the law whenever housing providers deprive people of their equal opportunity to enjoy their housing, including the right to be free from harassment based on their or their guests' disability or other status under the Fair Housing Act.""
According to HUD's charge, two tenants residing at the apartments in Reno, NV, were visited by a friend accompanied by his medically authorized emotional support dog. After seeing a dog in the building, the landlord of the property told one of the tenants that the building's ""no-pets"" policy barred their visitors from bringing animals into the unit. The tenant explained that her visitor's dog is an emotional support animal and said she could provide documentation that the animal was necessary because of a disability. Nonetheless, one day after the tenants' friend and his support animal visited again, DeAngeli served the tenants with an eviction notice, and later posted a note near their unit stating, ""If harassed or bothered by tenants of these apartments call 911 immediately.""
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he may award to aggrieved persons the damages caused to them by the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief to deter further discrimination, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose fines in order to vindicate the public interest. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages to aggrieved persons.

The latest housing data offer continued mixed signals as home prices improved for the fourth consecutive month but showed continued strain from foreclosures and distressed sales. Also, mortgage defaults and foreclosure completions continued a downward trend as more homeowners were able to secure mortgage relief. The full report is available online at www.hud.gov/scorecard.
""We're encouraged by the continued decline in mortgage defaults and recent trend in home prices, but we have much more work to do to help the market recover and to reach the many households across the nation who still face trouble,"" said HUD Assistant Secretary Raphael Bostic. ""More than 11.5 million homeowners have refinanced their mortgages since April 2009, putting a total of $20 billion a year in real savings in the hands of American families. As the President announced in his recent speech to Congress, to help responsible homeowners, we must make it easier for more people refinance at interest rates that are now near 4%. That alone can put more than $2,000 a year in a family's pocket, and give a lift to our still-struggling economy.""
""Every month, tens of thousands of additional homeowners benefit directly from the Administration's programs to help prevent avoidable foreclosures,"" said Treasury Assistant Secretary for Financial Stability Tim Massad. ""These programs have now set standards for the industry that have led to millions more homeowners receiving assistance at no expense to taxpayers. We recognize that there are homeowners who are still struggling but eligible for assistance and remain committed to reaching those homeowners.""
The September Housing Scorecard features key data on the health of the housing market and the impact of the Administration's foreclosure prevention programs, including:
Housing data available through August underscore market fragility and paint a mixed picture of recovery. Though August home prices as reported by S&P/Case-Shiller and FHFA improved for the fourth consecutive month after several previous months of decline, the latest housing data is a mixed bag with home prices showing continued strain from foreclosures and distressed sales. Foreclosure completions continued a downward trend, as mortgage aid programs are helping homeowners, although some of the decline remains due to lender processing issues delaying some foreclosure actions. The Administration's recovery efforts continue to help millions of families deal with the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. More than 5.1 million modification arrangements were started between April 2009 and the end of August 2011 - including nearly 1.7 million HAMP trial modification starts, more than 1,020,000 FHA loss mitigation and early delinquency interventions, and more than 2.4 million proprietary modifications under HOPE Now. Many of these modifications are a direct result of the standards and processes the Administration's programs have established. While some homeowners may have received help from more than one program, the total number of agreements offered continues to more than double the number of foreclosure completions for the same period (2.3 million). In August, more than 26,000 additional homeowners received a permanent modification through the Administration's Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP); more than 816,000 homeowners across the country have received a HAMP permanent modification to date, saving a median of $525 per month - more than one-third of their median before-modification payment. Even as new delinquencies continue to fall, eligible homeowners entering HAMP have a high likelihood of earning a permanent modification and realizing long-term success. Seventy-six percent of eligible homeowners entering a HAMP trial modification since June 1, 2010 received a permanent modification, with an average trial period of 3.5 months.

Also featured is the bi-monthly Housing Scorecard Regional Spotlight reporting on market strength in Cleveland, Ohio and surrounding communities. The Cleveland metropolitan statistical area (MSA) was among the nation's hardest hit areas following the housing market downturn and a region where the Administration's broad approach to stabilizing the housing market has been very active.
""Our Regional Spotlight shows that Cleveland was, in many ways, an early warning of the crisis that rippled across the nation. Years of job and workforce losses made the economy in Cleveland and the surrounding areas especially vulnerable. That fragility was compounded by the region's high share of distressed mortgages and steep decline in property values,"" added Bostic. ""However, we also show how the Administration's approach to stabilizing the housing market has been a source of real help to local families - helping more than 32,000 homeowners to avoid foreclosure.""
The Housing Scorecard Regional Spotlight features data on the health of the Cleveland housing market and impact of efforts to help homeowners at the local level including:
The foreclosure crisis developed much earlier in the five-county Cleveland metropolitan area and across the Midwest than in other areas of the nation. As early as 2003, the share of distressed mortgages in Cleveland was above the national average and rising - the rise in distressed mortgage shares did not begin until 2007 in most other regions. By the start of the national mortgage crisis in 2007, Cleveland had already experienced several years of above average unemployment and population declines - and high cost or subprime loans were defaulting at eight times the rate of other mortgages. For all of these reasons, the housing market in Cleveland remains fragile - with low property values, deeply-discounted foreclosed properties affecting neighborhood values, and many severely underwater mortgages. The Administration's mortgage assistance programs have helped tens of thousands of Cleveland families avoid foreclosure. Through August 2011, approximately 32,000 mortgage assistance interventions have been offered to homeowners in the Cleveland metropolitan area -- nearly twice the number of foreclosures during that period (16,200). Nearly 17,700 interventions were offered through the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) and the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loss mitigation and early delinquency intervention programs. An estimated additional 14,600 proprietary modifications have been offered through Hope Now Alliance servicers. While some homeowners may have received help from more than one program, the number of times assistance has been offered is nearly double the number of foreclosures completed during this period (16,200) in the Cleveland MSA. The Administration's Hardest Hit Fund and Neighborhood Stabilization Programs have fueled local foreclosure prevention efforts and market stability. Ohio has received a $570 million allocation from the Administration's Hardest Hit Fund to help families dealing with a permanent or temporary loss of income avoid foreclosure. Furthermore, more than $90 million has been awarded to eight local jurisdictions through the Neighborhood Stabilization Program to help purchase or redevelop residential properties and address the effects of abandoned and foreclosed housing. Both programs continue to help provide stability to the Cleveland housing market.

10/05/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-241.cfm,HUD Secretary and Mayor Jones Highlight How American Jobs Act Will Further Expand On Success of Existing Neighborhood Stabilization Efforts,"The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Shaun Donovan and Richmond Mayor Dwight Jones toured the 800 block of North 27th Street in the Church Hill neighborhood to demonstrate how the President Obama's proposed American Jobs Act and Project Rebuild can help stabilize home prices, revitalize neighborhoods, create jobs, and support local economies throughout the City of Richmond.
""Project Rebuild is fundamentally an investment not just in hard hit communities, but also in the hardworking families of Church Hill who have watched their home values plummet on average by $5,000-to-$10,000 simply because they live on a block with a foreclosure sign. The Project Rebuild investment will not only help stabilize individual home prices on the block, but it sends neighbors a hopeful message - we believe in you, we are investing in you, stay here and raise your family,"" said Shaun Donovan, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. ""Our previous neighborhood stabilization efforts have worked and we can see that in neighborhoods like Church Hill, where once stood three foreclosed homes, we now see revitalized properties, new homebuyers and jobs being created,"" he added.
""Building unique, healthy and inclusive communities is part of our strategy for becoming a Tier One City, and to succeed we need to marshal all available resources to address issues related to affordable and diverse housing options,"" said Mayor Jones. ""The Neighborhood Stabilization Program has been instrumental in helping us implement the East End Transformation Plan, which we launched last year in partnership with Bon Secours Community Hospital. We've also been able to leverage these dollars for maximum private and non-City investment to help put vacant and derelict properties back to productive use as we are assuming a comprehensive approach to neighborhood economic revitalization. We are encouraged by the federal Administration's decision to establish Project Rebuild, and support full funding of the program.""
Recent HUD statistics have shown that communities with neighborhood stabilization investments have seen 67 percent better home sale price changes, 73 percent saw better vacancy rate improvements, and 47 percent saw better home sale and vacancy rate improvements, as compared to similar communities without neighborhood stabilization improvements.
The Commonwealth of Virginia has received over $51 million in previous neighborhood stabilization efforts and municipalities like the City of Richmond could benefit from the proposed $15 billion in funding for Project Rebuild.
The City of Richmond has been allocated $2.4 million in Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP1) funds from the Virginia Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) to address foreclosed and abandoned properties. Through NSP3, the City of Richmond was allocated a direct grant of $1.25 million and about $300,000 from the Commonwealth of Virginia's NSP3 program.
Building on the Neighborhood Stabilization Program, Project Rebuild incorporates new elements such as the inclusion of revitalization of commercial properties and partnerships with for-profit organizations and stronger partnerships with non-profit organizations to an already successful program, and that will help create more jobs and have a much more immediate impact to the local economy.
If approved by Congress, Project Rebuild would invest $15 billion in proven strategies that leverage private capital and expertise to rehabilitate hundreds of thousands of properties in communities across the country. Building on the successful ideas developed during the implementation of the Neighborhood Stabilization Project (NSP), Project Rebuild would include the following innovative ideas:
Allow for the revitalization of commercial properties Include For-Profit Entities to Gain Expertise, Leverage Federal Dollars and Speed Program Implementation Increase Support for ""Land Banking"" Create Jobs Maintaining Properties and Avoid Community Blight
• Allow for the revitalization of commercial properties
• Include For-Profit Entities to Gain Expertise, Leverage Federal Dollars and Speed Program Implementation
• Increase Support for ""Land Banking""
• Create Jobs Maintaining Properties and Avoid Community Blight
Project Rebuild will create nearly 200,000 jobs nationwide and is fundamentally an investment not just in hard hit places but also in the families who live there - the millions of homeowners who have seen their property values decline through no fault of their own, just for being near a foreclosed property. Its inclusion in the American Jobs Act reflects President Obama's belief that rebuilding neighborhoods is essential to rebuilding our economy."
10/05/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-242.cfm,HUD Charges Dallas-Area Property Owner with Discriminating Against Families with Children,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is charging a property owner, manager and management company of Creek Point Apartments, a 200-unit, low-income tax-credit affordable housing complex in McKinney, Texas, with violating the Fair Housing Act for its restrictive policies regarding families with children.
HUD brings the charges on behalf of two families who lived at Creek Point Apartments, alleging that Creek Point's ban on children playing outside without supervision discriminated against the families and forced them to move out. One of the families was fined for violating the rule, and management charged both families substantial move out fees.
The Fair Housing Act expressly prohibits housing discrimination on the basis of familial status, including setting restrictive terms and conditions on tenants with children.
""Overly restrictive rental policies targeted at children deprive families with children of basic enjoyment of their homes,"" said John Trasviña, Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will enforce the Fair Housing Act when unfair or overly restrictive rules discriminate against families with children.""
The charge alleges that Creek Point management sent a notice to tenants prohibiting children under age 16 and later age 18, from being outside without adult supervision. The notice stated, in part: ""THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT CHILDREN CAN BE WATCHED FROM WINDOWS AND BREEZEWAYS . . . IF YOUR CHILD IS CAUGHT OUTSIDE WITHOUT A PARENT RIGHT BESIDE THEM YOU WILL BE GIVEN A FINE OF $50.00 AND RENT WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED IF THIS IS NOT PAID IN FULL ASAP!""
The policy was strictly enforced. The charge alleges that the father of one of the families watched from the breezeway in front of his apartment as a staff member sent his son indoors because he was playing outside without his parent standing next to him. The mother of the other family felt compelled to drive her daughter 10 minutes to the park to avoid incurring a fine when her daughter wanted to play outside. Management fined one of the two families and issued notices of lease violations and fines to at least eight other residents.
According to the charge, several months after the policy was imposed, one of the two families wrote to management that the current policy was illegal, and requested that it be retracted. Management refused. Rather than be forced to keep their children cooped up inside, both families moved from their homes in Creek Point Apartments. Property management charged one of the families more than $2,200 in fees and costs, and charged the other approximately $500.
The HUD charge of Discrimination will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that illegal discrimination has occurred, the judge may award monetary damages to the families for the harm they were caused by the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive and other equitable relief to deter further discrimination, as well as payment of attorney's fees. In addition, the judge may impose fines in order to vindicate the public interest. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages to aggrieved persons.

10/06/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-243.cfm,"HUD Charges Minnesota Property Owner, Manager with Discriminating Against Elderly Couple","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is charging a Foley, Minnesota property owner, manager, and management company with violating the Fair Housing Act for forcing an elderly couple to vacate their apartment because of the manager's perception that they were unable to care for themselves. HUD brings the charge on behalf of the couple, alleging that Big Norway, LLC, Northern Management Real Estate Services, Inc., and its employee, Laura Schroden, pressured the couple to move to an assisted living facility even though there was no evidence that the couple was a safety threat to themselves or to others.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in housing because of a person's perceived disability.
""Seniors should not be forced to leave their homes because someone stereotypes them as being unable to live independently,"" said John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""It's not the role of property owners and managers to decide whether elderly persons can live on their own. HUD is committed to protecting the rights of seniors to make their own housing choices, free from discrimination.""
According to HUD's charge, Northern Management's Vice President of Operations, Laura Schroden, contacted the couple's children and grandchildren multiple times in a campaign to pressure the couple to move out of the building. Big Norway, Northern Management, and Schroden cited the couple's ""forgetfulness"" and how easily they ""would get agitated when involved in different situations"" as evidence of management's belief that the couple ""should be in assisted living."" Schroden described the couple as ""handicapped"" even though there had been no incidents involving the couple's health or safety in their more than three years of tenancy at the apartment complex. The family, who visited frequently, maintained that the couple was still active and capable of living on their own: they managed their own bills, shopping, and laundry, and frequently babysat for their great-grandchildren. After one of the couple's complaints to management, Schroden allegedly told their grandson that they should move ""right away or they may find themselves without housing.""
Although the couple repeatedly informed management that they did not want to move and did not need help, after more than three months of pressure they moved to a townhouse in a senior community 20 miles away, where they could no longer visit frequently with their family. The couple continues to live independently.
The HUD Charge of Discrimination will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that illegal discrimination has occurred, the judge may award monetary damages to the families for the harm they were caused by the discrimination.

HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing & Equal Opportunity, John Trasviña added: ""Last year, HUD filed more Fair Housing Act charges than any year since 2002. The Fair Housing Initiatives Program grantees play a vital role to enhance our civil rights law enforcement efforts.""
The categories of grants awarded today are:
Private Enforcement Initiative grants (PEI) - HUD awarded $17.5 million to help groups investigate alleged housing discrimination, and enforce the Fair Housing Act and state and local laws that are substantially equivalent to the Act.

10/07/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-246.cfm,"HUD Secretary, U.S. Senator Brown, Mayor Coleman to Highlight How American Jobs Act Will Complement Existing Neighborhood Stabilization Efforts","The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Shaun Donovan, U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown and Columbus Mayor Michael Coleman toured the Commons at Third project, adjacent to Grandview to demonstrate how the President Obama's proposed American Jobs Act and Project Rebuild can help stabilize home prices, revitalize neighborhoods, create jobs, and support local economies throughout the City of Columbus.
""Our previous neighborhood stabilization efforts have worked as evidenced by the over one hundred workers that the Commons at Third project has employed,"" said Shaun Donovan, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. ""Now we must continue to put more people to work revitalizing homes and businesses that were once foreclosed. The State of Ohio could receive over $577 million for Project Rebuild when the American Jobs Act and Project Rebuild is passed by Congress, that would help create more jobs for American workers and revitalized neighborhoods across the state.""
""By rebuilding neighborhoods devastated by the economic crisis, we will improve surrounding property values, create new jobs, and foster long-term economic growth,"" Brown said. ""Project Rebuild would put vacant properties to good use and target funds to the hardest-hit communities so we can jump start economic growth and strengthen our communities.""
Project Rebuild will create nearly 200,000 jobs, and at the same time stabilize home prices in neighborhoods hard hit by foreclosures. Previous neighborhood stabilization efforts enacted by Congress over the last three years since the housing crisis began are on track to support nearly 90,000 jobs and address more than 95,000 vacant and abandoned properties.
The City of Columbus has been allocated at total of $50.8 million in Neighborhood Stabilization Program Funds. 22.8 million in (NSP1), 22.2 in (NSP2) and $4.8 in (NSP3).
""If not for the support of President Obama and HUD, Columbus would not be in the strong position we're in today,"" Mayor Michael B. Coleman said. ""Thanks to the President and Secretary Donovan, we are creating jobs and improving the lives of our residents.""
Building on the Neighborhood Stabilization Program, Project Rebuild incorporates new elements such as the inclusion of revitalization of commercial properties and partnerships with for-profit organizations and stronger partnerships with non-profit organizations to an already successful program, and that will help create more jobs and have a much more immediate impact to the local economy.
If approved by Congress, Project Rebuild would invest $15 billion in proven strategies that leverage private capital and expertise to rehabilitate hundreds of thousands of properties in communities across the country. Building on the successful ideas developed during the implementation of the Neighborhood Stabilization Project (NSP), Project Rebuild would include the following innovative ideas:
Allow for the revitalization of commercial properties Include For-Profit Entities to Gain Expertise, Leverage Federal Dollars and Speed Program Implementation Increase Support for ""Land Banking"" Create Jobs Maintaining Properties and Avoiding Community Blight
• Allow for the revitalization of commercial properties
• Include For-Profit Entities to Gain Expertise, Leverage Federal Dollars and Speed Program Implementation
• Increase Support for ""Land Banking""
• Create Jobs Maintaining Properties and Avoiding Community Blight
Project Rebuild is fundamentally an investment not just in hard hit places but also in the families who live there - the millions of homeowners who have seen their property values decline through no fault of their own, just for being near a foreclosed property. Its inclusion in the American Jobs Act reflects President Obama's belief that rebuilding neighborhoods is essential to rebuilding our economy."
10/07/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-247.cfm,HUD Charges New York Real Estate Company and Salesperson with Discriminating Against Families with Children,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is charging Metro Net Realty, LLC, a Queens, NY, real estate agency, and a salesperson for the agency with violating the Fair Housing Act by placing advertisements on Craigslist that discriminated against families with children. HUD brings the charge on behalf of the National Fair Housing Alliance (NFHA), alleging that the advertisements that stated ""Looking For: Mature couple or single with no children"" were evidence of an effort to exclude children from housing.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to refuse to rent to a family because they have children, including posting or publishing online statements or advertisements that discriminate against families with children. Real estate companies and agents are prohibited from placing advertisements that exclude children from housing.
""Advertising that discriminates against families with children is against the law, whether it's in print or online. Real estate professionals are expected to know the law,"" said John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD is committed to protecting the right of families with children to choose housing free from illegal discrimination.""
According to HUD's charge, NFHA, a fair housing organization that works to promote equal opportunity in housing, noticed the ad on Craigslist for a two-bedroom apartment in Brooklyn. A few weeks later, NFHA saw the same ad again on Craigslist. HUD's investigation found that both ads were placed by Metro Net and its employee.
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages to aggrieved persons for the damages caused them by the discrimination.
The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief to deter further discrimination, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose fines in order to vindicate the public interest. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages to aggrieved persons.

10/11/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-248.cfm,HUD Charges University of Nebraska at Kearney with Discriminating Against Student with Disabilities,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced today that it is charging the University of Nebraska at Kearney and five of its employees with violating the Fair Housing Act when they refused to grant a student permission to have a therapy dog live in her University-owned apartment and illegally inquired into the nature and severity of the student's disabilities. The student, who required the dog in order to cope with depression and anxiety, was seeking an exception to the University's no-pet policy as a disability-related ""reasonable accommodation"" under the Fair Housing Act.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to refuse to make reasonable accommodations to rules, policies, practices or services when needed to provide persons with disabilities an equal opportunity to use or enjoy a dwelling. It is also unlawful under the Fair Housing Act to inquire whether an applicant for a dwelling has a disability or to inquire as to the nature or severity of a disability of such a person, with limited exceptions.
""Allowing a student to live with an assistance animal promotes independent living, and can mean the difference between having a college opportunity or not,"" said John Trasviña, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Like other housing providers, colleges and universities must follow the Fair Housing Act and make reasonable accommodations in housing for persons with disabilities.""
According to HUD's charge, the student provided the University with information from her medical provider establishing a need for a therapy animal. However, the University sought additional information that was unnecessary to evaluate the student's reasonable accommodation request including treatment information, her prescribed medications, and a clinical summary of her limitations. The University ultimately denied the student's request asserting that the Fair Housing Act did not apply to the University-owned apartment complex. As a result of the denial, the student was forced to move out of University housing and withdrew from the University.
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that illegal discrimination has occurred, she may award monetary damages to the aggrieved person. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief to deter further discrimination, as well as payment of attorney fees.

10/11/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-249.cfm,"HUD Charges Utah Homeowner Association, Condo Owners with Discriminating Against Veteran with A Disability","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced it is charging a Park City, Utah homeowner association, property management company, and a group of condominium owners with violating the Fair Housing Act for refusing to accommodate a tenant who required an emotional support dog because of a disability. HUD brings the charges on behalf of the tenant, a Gulf War veteran with a disability.
HUD is alleging Fox Point at Redstone, a multifamily housing complex, assessed illegal fees and fines against the tenant and the owners of his condominium unit for the presence of the assistance animal. HUD is also charging the condominium owners for their refusal to renew the tenant's lease unless he paid the charges. The Fair Housing Act requires landlords to make reasonable accommodations to no-pet rules for renters with disabilities who need emotional support animals.
""Today, many veterans return home with mobility impairments or other conditions that can be alleviated by a support animal,"" said John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will enforce the Fair Housing Act against policies that prevent people with disabilities from having a medically necessary assistance animal at home.""
According to HUD's charges, Fox Point's homeowner association required the tenant to pay a registration fee, provide proof of liability coverage, and sign a medical release for it to obtain his confidential medical records. The tenant provided medical documentation of his need for the assistance animal and obtained liability insurance, but refused to give Respondents access to his private medical information or to pay the $150 fee. Even after it acknowledged that the veteran's dog was a medically necessary assistance animal, the association continued to demand that he pay the fee. The association also assessed a number of fines against the condo owners for the presence of the support dog, and the condo owners refused to renew the tenant's lease until he paid the fee and the fines. The tenant and his wife moved away rather than pay. Such fees and fines are prohibited by the Fair Housing Act, as are requirements that persons with disabilities obtain liability insurance and provide their medical records.
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that illegal discrimination has occurred, the judge may award monetary damages to the complainant for the harm he was caused by the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive and other equitable relief to deter further discrimination, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose fines in order to vindicate the public interest. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages to complainant.

Specifically, Primeau pled guilty to charges he directed employees of Lend America, a former FHA-approved lender, to divert mortgage funds intended to pay off borrowers' first mortgages at refinance closings in order to pay company operating expenses.
""We take this action to protect the public,"" said HUD's General Counsel Helen Kanovsky. ""Beyond this particular suspension, the broader message to the lending community should be crystal clear - the federal government will not do business with those who fleece homeowners.""
Two years ago, HUD found that Ideal Mortgage Bankers, doing business as Lend America and Lending Key (""Ideal""), repeatedly violated the Federal Housing Administration's (FHA) origination and underwriting requirements, including submitting false certifications and failing to document borrower income and creditworthiness.
As a consequence, HUD withdrew the company's FHA approval, preventing Ideal from originating and underwriting new FHA-insured mortgages or from participating in the FHA single family insurance program. In addition, the Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae) terminated Lend America as an issuer and seized its portfolio. Read HUD's news release."
10/14/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-251.cfm,"HUD Charges Florida Property Owner, Managers with Disability Discrimination","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has charged an Ocala, Florida property owner, management company, and its employees with violating the Fair Housing Act for refusing to allow a resident to move to a different apartment after her neighbors' second-hand smoke twice sent her to the emergency room.
HUD brings the charge on behalf of the resident, alleging that managers at Magnolia Walk II, a 144-unit low income housing tax credit participant property, falsely claimed that tax law required that they treat the tenant's request like a new application, requiring new fees and deposits, before they could grant her request.
The Fair Housing Act requires landlords to make reasonable accommodations for renters with disabilities.
""Owners and managers of low-income housing tax credit properties, like others, must rent and manage apartments in a manner consistent with the Fair Housing Act,"" said John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""A transfer to another unit when it is medically necessary not only affords a person with a disability the same opportunity to enjoy her housing as others do, but may also be critical to that person's well-being. HUD will ensure through its enforcement of the law that people with disabilities have the opportunity to live in the housing of their choice.""
According to HUD's charge, the resident had to be transported to the emergency room twice from her apartment after complaining of difficulty breathing. First orally, and then formally in writing, the tenant informed Magnolia Walk II management that smoke was coming into her apartment from other units, and that her doctor had advised her to avoid exposure to cigarette smoke because it would exacerbate her chronic respiratory illness. She requested to move to a vacant apartment located between an elevator and a unit occupied by a non-smoker.
Managers claimed, falsely, that tax regulations prevented the tenant's transfer without her being treated as a new tenant, necessitating an application fee and additional security deposit, as well as an early termination fee for vacating her current unit. To avoid paying the early termination fee, the tenant waited to move to the requested unit until after her lease expired, nearly a year after her first request. Management still charged her the application fee and additional security deposit.
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that illegal discrimination has occurred, the judge may award monetary damages to the resident for the harm she was caused by the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive and other equitable relief to deter further discrimination, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose fines in order to vindicate the public interest. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages to the resident.

10/18/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-255.cfm,HUD Charges Philadelphia Condominium Association with Discriminating Against Residents with Disabilities,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced today that it is charging a Philadelphia condominium association with violating the Fair Housing Act for refusing to revise its ""no pets"" policy as a reasonable accommodation for condominium residents with disabilities who required assistance animals. HUD's charge alleges that The Philadelphian Owners' Association (POA), which manages the 776-unit Philadelphian condominium complex, required that residents provide burdensome and invasive medical documentation before requests for accommodation would be considered, severely limited access to the complex's facilities for residents accompanied by assistance animals, and failed to address several instances of harassment of residents requiring assistance animals.
The Fair Housing Act requires property managers, including condominium associations, to make reasonable accommodations to no-pet rules for persons with disabilities who require assistance animals.
""Assistance animals are not pets. They play a vital role in helping people with disabilities conduct everyday activities and fully enjoy their homes,"" said John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Condominium associations have a responsibility under the Fair Housing Act to grant reasonable accommodations when they are needed.""
HUD brings the charge on behalf of a resident who alleged that the POA denied her request for permission to have a medically-prescribed assistance dog, threatened her with fines and other sanctions for her failure to comply with the restrictive policy, and did not address her concerns over harassment she had experienced from her neighbors because of her assistance dog.
HUD's charge is also based on the results of a ""Secretary-initiated investigation,"" which HUD conducted to protect the interests of other residents who used or sought to use assistance animals, because the policies suggested systemic violations of the Fair Housing Act that went beyond the allegations of the individual who filed a complaint.
According to HUD's charge, the POA implemented increasingly restrictive and onerous policies over a twenty-year period. In a new 2011 policy, the POA issued detailed ""Instructions for Physicians for Documenting Disability Under the Federal Fair Housing Act,"" which required exhaustive documentation to support a doctor's opinion about the necessity of an assistance animal, and stated, ""it may be necessary for you to testify under oath in federal court about your opinion."" The 2011 policy banned persons using assistance animals from accessing the main lobby, shuttle bus, social rooms, fitness rooms, mail room, and laundry room, and required them to use the service elevator. HUD's charge alleges that, as a result of the restrictive policies of The Philadelphian, residents with disabilities have been discouraged from requesting needed assistance animals.
The case that is the subject of HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages to aggrieved persons for the damages caused them by the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief to deter further discrimination, as well as payment of attorney's fees. In addition, the judge may impose fines in order to vindicate the public interest. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages to aggrieved persons.

Funded through HUD's Self-Help Homeownership Opportunity Program (SHOP), the funding awarded today, along with the labor contributed by these households, will significantly lower the cost of homeownership.
""These grants are about families devoting their own sweat and labor into their American Dream,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""With the help of these organizations and volunteers, families are able to see that dream become reality brick by brick.""
The following organizations will receive SHOP funds:
The SHOP program provides federal grants on a competitive basis to national and regional nonprofit organizations and consortia that have experience in administering self-help housing programs. The SHOP grants must be used to purchase land and install or improve infrastructure, which together may not exceed an average investment of $15,000 per dwelling unit. Leveraged funds must be used for the construction or rehabilitation of these homeownership units. Grantees may carry out activities directly and/or distribute SHOP funds to local nonprofit affiliates that will develop the SHOP units, select homebuyers, coordinate the homebuyer sweat equity and volunteer efforts, and assist in the arrangement of interim and permanent financing for the homebuyers.
All newly constructed and gut rehabilitated units of 3 stories or less will receive certification as an ENERGY STAR Qualified New Home and all appliances and products or features which are installed or replaced will be ENERGY STAR qualified. Water usage products will bear the WaterSense label. Many units will also have ""Green"", ""Healthy Homes"" and ""Universal Design"" features
Homebuyers must contribute a minimum of 100 hours of sweat equity on the construction of their homes and/or the homes of other homebuyers participating in the local self-help housing program. Reasonable accommodations are made for homebuyers with disabilities. Sweat equity involves participation in the construction of the housing, which can include, but is not limited to, assisting in the painting, carpentry, trim work, drywall, roofing and siding for the housing. Labor is also contributed by community volunteers. The sweat equity and labor contributions by the homebuyers and volunteers significantly reduce the cost of the housing.
Most of the families who benefit from SHOP homes are first-time homeowners so the new home fulfills a lifelong dream. The organizations that receive the SHOP grants also ensure the new homeowners can afford to stay in their homes for the long term to provide a safe, healthy, stable environment to raise children, access jobs and build community.
Since 1996, when Congress first appropriated SHOP funds, the program and numerous volunteers has provided more than $360 million in federal grants to create more than 24,000 units of affordable, homeownership housing that have transformed lives and neighborhoods."

10/19/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-254.cfm,New HUD Study Finds Moving to Low-Poverty Neighborhoods Lowers Risk of Obesity and Diabetes for Poor Women,"WASHINGTON - Very-low income women who have the opportunity to move from high-poverty neighborhoods into lower poverty areas are significantly less likely to be extremely obese or to have diabetes. Those are among the key findings of a study by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. An article published today in the New England Journal of Medicine (www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa1103216) (NEJM) highlights the positive health findings, which the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development previewed today.
""This study proves that concentrated poverty is not only bad policy, it's bad for your health,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""Far too often, we can predict a family's overall health, even their life expectancy, by knowing their zip code. But it's not enough to simply move families into different neighborhoods. We must continue to look for innovative and strategic ways to connect families to the necessary supports they need to break the cycle of poverty that can quite literally make them sick.""
""Neighborhoods, Obesity, and Diabetes — A Randomized Social Experiment,"" will be published in the October 20th issue of NEJM. The article looks at the long-term impact of housing mobility on obesity and diabetes from the HUD study Moving to Opportunity for Fair Housing Demonstration Program: Final Evaluation. HUD's study tested the long-term health impacts of approximately 4,500 very low-income families living in public housing projects in high-poverty neighborhoods in Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles and New York.
""Where you live can be critical to your health, "" said Secretary for Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius. ""Families need quality housing and neighborhoods with clean air, safe places to play and exercise, and access to healthy and affordable foods to promote better health and wellness.""
The findings featured in the NEJM article showed that giving very poor families the opportunity to move to neighborhoods with lower poverty can have a positive impact on the physical health of adult women.
The women who were not offered vouchers through this study had a prevalence rate of 18 percent for extreme obesity, much larger than the national average for women of approximately 7 percent. Women who were given the opportunity to move with housing vouchers to low-poverty neighborhoods showed a significantly reduced rate of extreme obesity - 3.4 percentage points lower - than the women who did not receive vouchers. This means women with the opportunity to move were nearly one fifth less likely to be extremely obese than were women who were not offered a housing voucher through MTO. The prevalence rate for diabetes for the group of women who were not offered vouchers through the study was 20 percent, compared to the national average for women of 12 percent. For the group of women with the opportunity to move to low-poverty neighborhoods, the prevalence rate was 5.2 percentage points lower (as measured by glycated hemoglobin) than the women who did not receive housing vouchers. This means women with the opportunity to move were one fifth less likely to have diabetes than women who were not offered a housing voucher through the MTO study.

MacArthur Foundation, the National Institute on Aging (NIA), the National Institute for Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
HUD began the Moving to Opportunity for Fair Housing Demonstration Program (MTO) in 1994 to examine the effect of neighborhood on low-income families with children. Approximately 4,600 very low-income families living in public housing projects in five large cities - Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles and New York - enrolled in the demonstration.
Between 1994 and 1998 families were randomly assigned to one of three groups: the experimental group, which allowed families to only use the voucher in low-poverty neighborhoods; the Section 8 group, which allowed the families to use the voucher in any neighborhood; and the control group, which did not receive vouchers. All families had the option of remaining in their current neighborhood. HUD tracked and interviewed the families until 2010.
During the study years, HUD released a number of analyses that revealed experiences of MTO participants. In 2003, HUD released ""The Moving to Opportunity for Fair Housing Demonstration Interim Impacts Evaluation (www.huduser.org/Publications/pdf/MTOFullReport.pdf)."" HUD will release the final report early November."
11/01/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-258.cfm,HUD Suspends Allied Home Mortgage Corp. and CEO,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Mortgagee Review Board (MRB) today immediately suspended Allied Home Mortgage Corporation, thereby preventing the company from originating and underwriting new mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). HUD is also suspending the company's president and chief executive officer, James C. Hodge, and proposing to debar him as well as the company's executive vice president, Jeanne L. Stell.
In addition, the Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae) is suspending the Houston-based lender's ability to issue securities in its Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS) program.
The MRB's and Ginnie Mae's suspension of Allied comes as the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan filed a lawsuit against the company, Allied Home Mortgage Capital Corporation, Hodge and Stell on multiple charges of mortgage fraud and for violating numerous FHA requirements.
During a news conference in New York announcing the government's actions, HUD's General Counsel Helen Kanovsky said, ""We will not tolerate mortgage lenders who play fast and loose with FHA's standards. These defendants demonstrated a pattern of recklessness and utter disregard for how we do business. They've harmed FHA, hurt homeowners, and now they'll be held to account for their actions.""
FHA and Ginnie Mae are imposing these actions because Allied originated loans from un-approved branch offices in violation of FHA requirements and then concealed these violations by submitting knowingly false information. HUD's MRB found the following violations:
• Allied violated HUD/FHA requirements when it originated loans from branch offices that were not FHA-approved. HUD requires that all loans originated and submitted to HUD for FHA mortgage insurance must be originated at a branch office that has been approved by HUD. For every loan that a mortgagee submits to HUD for FHA mortgage insurance, the lender must provide the FHA ID of the branch where the loan was originated. Allied originated loans from branch offices that were not FHA-approved. Allied concealed its violations of HUD/FHA requirements by submitting the improperly-originated loans under the FHA ID of approved branch offices.
• Allied submitted false information to HUD when it submitted loan packages to HUD for FHA mortgage insurance that contained false information about where the loans were originated. Allied submitted false information to HUD when it submitted loan packages to HUD for FHA mortgage insurance that contained false information about where the loans were originated. HUD requires that all loans originated and submitted to HUD for FHA mortgage insurance must provide the FHA ID of the branch where the loan was originated. Allied submitted loans to HUD for FHA mortgage insurance that contained false representations about where the loans were originated.
• Allied violated HUD/FHA requirements when it failed to ensure that the corporate entity paid the operating expenses of the FHA-approved branch offices. HUD requires that lenders pay all of the operating expenses incurred at the branch offices involved in originating FHA-insured loans. Operating expenses include equipment, furniture, office rent, overhead, employee compensation, and similar expenses. Allied failed to pay the operating expenses for some of its approved branch offices.
• Allied failed to implement a Quality Control (""QC"") Plan in compliance with HUD/FHA requirements. Allied failed to implement a Quality Control (""QC"") Plan in compliance with HUD/FHA requirements. HUD requires that FHA-approved lenders review 10% of the loans it originates and all the loans that go into default into default within the first six payments. The findings from these reviews are required to be reported to the lender's senior management. HUD also requires that lenders conduct site reviews of their offices to ensure compliance with HUD requirements. Allied utilized inadequate and unqualified staff for its reviews.
• Allied submitted false certifications to HUD when it submitted its annual recertification materials to HUD for the years 2006-2011. Allied submitted false certifications to HUD when it submitted its annual recertification materials to HUD for the years 2006-2011. HUD requires that the lender, when seeking to renew its FHA approval status, certify that it ""complied with and agrees to continue to comply with HUD-FHA regulations, handbooks, Mortgagee Letters… policies, and terms of any agreements entered into with the Department."" The FHA-approved lender must also certify that it ""conforms to all HUD-FHA regulations necessary to maintain its HUD-FHA approval."" Allied made these certifications on a yearly basis from 2006 through 2011. Each of these certifications was false because Allied had failed to implement a Quality Control (""QC"") Plan in compliance with HUD/FHA requirements, as set forth more fully in Violation 4.
• Allied employed a principal, officer and director when such person was suspended."

MacArthur Foundation and the National Building Museum.
It was a day-long conference that explored the latest research and cross-disciplinary policies to connect safe, stable housing to innovative education, health and economic development services for families. The two Secretaries discussed Obama Administration priorities that speak to interagency collaboration to develop place-based strategies to support local communities in obtaining the tools they need to revitalize neighborhoods of concentrated poverty into neighborhoods of opportunity.
""Today's conversation was about how HUD, HHS and other agencies can continue to deepen the connection between housing and community development and health policy to improve the lives of families,"" said HUD Secretary Donovan. ""Research is continuing to show that housing is a public health intervention and a platform for improving the quality of life.""
""Health care is not only about what happens in the doctor's office or hospital. Good health begins in the home and the community,"" said HHS Secretary Sebelius. ""Our agencies share a commitment to creating safe, healthy environments for people to live, learn, work and play. Across the government, and with public and private partners represented at today's conference, we're moving toward a focus on wellness and prevention to ensure every American has the opportunity to live their healthiest life possible.""
Among the discussion topics were results from HUD's Moving to Opportunity for Fair Housing Demonstration Program: Final Impacts Evaluation Study (MTO Study) (www.huduser.org/portal/publications/pubasst/MTOFHD.html) released today.
The MTO Study is HUD's longest and most wide-ranging randomized research project. It tested the long-term impacts of the opportunity to move to low-poverty neighborhoods.
Approximately 4,600 very low-income families living in public housing projects in high-poverty neighborhoods in Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles and New York enrolled in the demonstration.
Key findings from the study show:
Assisting very poor families to live in neighborhoods with lower poverty and crime led to sustained improvements in housing quality and in many aspects of the neighborhood's environment, including neighborhood socioeconomic composition and safety. These MTO-induced changes translate into a number of important improvements in mental and physical health for adults, including lower rates of extreme obesity, diabetes, psychological distress, and major depression for adult women. Female youth in the experimental group had lower prevalence of mood disorder, and fewer serious emotional or behavioral difficulties. Male youth showed no similar benefits from moving. Impacts on risky and criminal behavior of youth were mixed: Male youth in families given the opportunity to move were more likely to smoke but less likely to have been arrested for drug sales; female youth in the experimental group were less likely to have tried alcohol; most other outcomes did not differ significantly from the control group. The study also shows no apparent impact on employment and earnings for adults or their now grown children as a result of the move to lower poverty neighborhoods 12 to 15 years earlier. The study also showed no impact on educational achievement among either male or female youth

11/03/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-260.cfm,Obama Administration Releases October Housing Scorecard,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of the Treasury today released the October edition of the Obama Administration's Housing Scorecard - a comprehensive report on the nation's housing market. The latest housing data offer continued mixed signals as new home sales rose compared to August, but were still slightly down from the prior year. Mortgage defaults and foreclosure sales continued a downward trend as more homeowners were able to secure mortgage relief. However, foreclosure completions ticked slightly upward in September after months of decline.
Also, beginning this month the Housing Scorecard will capture data on the Administration's Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP). The Federal Housing Finance Agency recently announced efforts to ease refinance guidelines for homeowners. The full report is available online at www.hud.gov/scorecard.
HUD Assistant Secretary Raphael Bostic said ""The housing data in this month's Scorecard illustrate how complex the market is and why the Obama Administration has chosen a variety of approaches to help spur recovery. Last month we saw a continued fall in mortgage defaults, due in part to our foreclosure prevention programs reaching more borrowers upstream in the process. And in the last quarter, a million more homeowners refinanced their loans under some of the lowest interest rates in history. But despite these signs of progress, we have much more work to do to reach the many households who still face trouble and to help the market recover. To help responsible homeowners, we have to make it easier for people to refinance at interest rates that are now near 4% - putting hundreds of dollars in real savings back in their pockets each month, and giving a boost to our fragile economy.""
""The Administration's programs continue to provide some of the most sustainable assistance available to tens of thousands of struggling homeowners every month,"" said Treasury Assistant Secretary for Financial Stability Tim Massad. ""The standards we have set are changing the industry and indirectly helping millions of additional families.""
The October Housing Scorecard features key data on the health of the housing market and the impact of the Administration's foreclosure prevention programs, including:
The Administration's recovery efforts continue to help millions of families deal with the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. More than 5.3 million modification arrangements were started between April 2009 and the end of September 2011 - including more than 1.7 million HAMP trial modification starts, more than 1,064,000 FHA loss mitigation and early delinquency interventions, and more than 2.5 million proprietary modifications under HOPE Now. Many of these modifications are a direct result of the standards and processes the Administration's programs have established. While some homeowners may have received help from more than one program, the total number of agreements offered continues to more than double the number of foreclosure completions for the same period (2.3 million). More than 850,000 homeowners have received a HAMP permanent modification to date, with a median payment reduction of over $520 each month. Even as new delinquencies continue to fall, eligible homeowners entering HAMP have a high likelihood of earning a permanent modification and realizing long-term success. Eighty percent of eligible homeowners entering a HAMP trial modification since June 1, 2010 received a permanent modification, with an average trial period of 3.5 months. After six months in the program, more than 94 percent of homeowners remain in their HAMP permanent modification. Homeowners in HAMP permanent modifications have saved an estimated $8.8 billion to date.

11/03/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-261.cfm,HUD Reaches Settlement with Connecticut Lender Accused of 'Maternity Discrimination',"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced today that it has reached an agreement with Luxury Mortgage Corporation (LMC), a mortgage lender based in Stamford, Connecticut, settling accusations that the lender discriminated against a woman by denying her mortgage loan because she was on maternity leave. Under the settlement, LMC agrees to pay the woman who was denied the mortgage $12,000.
The settlement is the result of a complaint that was filed by a couple who claimed LMC discriminated against them when it denied the woman a mortgage loan because she was on maternity leave. The woman alleges that even though her employer provided a letter stating that she was on paid maternity leave, LMC told her that the letter was not sufficient. The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing discrimination in sales, rental, and lending based on a person's sex, orfamily status.
""A woman's access to a mortgage loan shouldn't hinge on her maternity status,"" said John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Mortgage professionals have a right to protect their business interests, but lending practices that involve denying mortgages to expectant mothers, especially when they are on paid leave and plan to return to work, violate the law.""
In addition to compensating the woman who was denied the mortgage $12,000, LMC, while admitting no violation of the law, agrees to change its lending policy to approve mortgage loans to qualified women who are pregnant or on maternity/parental leave, including leave for adoptions."

HOME is the largest federal block grant to state and local governments designed exclusively to produce affordable housing for low-income families. Since 1992, the HOME Program has successfully assisted more than one million affordable homes for lower income families. However, Secretary Donovan believes the program can be strengthened to significantly boost the program's performance at the local level.
""The HOME program is a success story for housing low-income Americans and creating jobs,"" said Secretary Donovan. ""However, there's more we can do to boost the program's performance and accountability. Through these new steps, we want to expand HOME's impact and ensure that every dollar is used smartly to help families afford their homes. Since we took office, we have been committed to strengthening the HOME Program and ensuring that it creates affordable housing in an efficient and accountable way.""
In 2009, soon after taking office, the Obama Administration accelerated efforts to re-write some of the HOME's compliance rules. Today, HUD is presenting Congress a proposed rule for a required review period and will shortly publish full details of the proposed regulatory improvements in the Federal Register. HUD has found that there are areas in the program's underlying regulations that can improve program performance at the local level and ensure that high quality affordable housing is being provided for low-income families in a way that delivers the best value to the taxpayer.
Specifically, HUD's proposed rule would:
Require state and local governments to adopt policies and procedures to improve their oversight of projects, develop a system for assessing the relative risk of projects, and more closely monitor their HOME-funded sub-recipients; Require state and local governments to assess a developer's capacity and the long-term viability of the project, before they commit HOME funds to a project; Require more frequent reporting by state and local 'participating jurisdictions' to enable HUD to more closely track projects once they're under way; and Set a higher 'performance bar' by establishing specific timeframes for taking appropriate corrective actions against participating jurisdictions who fail to complete what they started.
• Require state and local governments to adopt policies and procedures to improve their oversight of projects, develop a system for assessing the relative risk of projects, and more closely monitor their HOME-funded sub-recipients;
• Require state and local governments to assess a developer's capacity and the long-term viability of the project, before they commit HOME funds to a project;
• Require more frequent reporting by state and local 'participating jurisdictions' to enable HUD to more closely track projects once they're under way; and
• Set a higher 'performance bar' by establishing specific timeframes for taking appropriate corrective actions against participating jurisdictions who fail to complete what they started.
Beyond improving the HOME program's underlying regulations, HUD is in the process of improving the Department's Integrated Disbursement and Information System (IDIS). IDIS is the primary data collection and reporting mechanism for tracking the commitment of HOME funds as well as the actual expenditure of these resources on a project-by-project basis. HUD is making significant changes to IDIS to improve grant management, reduce risk and address troubled projects."

HUD's Office of Native American Programs has worked with the group of leading national American Indian and Alaska Native organizations who have collaborated with tribal and federal government offices to mark the month with special programs and festivities.
""Native American Youth - Our Most Precious Resource,"" is the national theme of the month, and HUD will mark it with an event on Wednesday, November 30, at 11 a.m. its Washington headquarters. Ms. Derrith Watchman-Moore, HUD Region VII Administrator, will be the main speaker. Also invited are Mellor Willie, the Executive Director of the National American Indian Housing Council; and speakers from the Penobscot Nation Native Boys and Girls Club and the Center on Native American Youth at the Aspen Institute. The program will be emceed by Julie Potter, an intern from the Washington Internships for Native Students (WINS) Program at American University who produced a documentary about the impact of housing on Indian reservations. Her tribe is the Eastern Band of the Cherokee located in Cherokee, North Carolina.
""HUD is honored to help mark November as a time to reflect on our Native youth and how the generations of future leaders can help tribal communities keep moving forward on everything from housing to education, thanks to their tribal leadership and their proud legacies,"" said Rodger Boyd, HUD's Deputy Assistant Secretary for the Office of Native American Programs.
Young people under the age of 18 are a growing share of America's Native population, accounting for nearly 32 percent of the 5.2 million American Indian and Alaska Natives (2010 Census data). It's expected the growing Native youth population that will be more active in the nation's workforce, higher education and among the electorate.
Heritage Month 2011 will focus on Native youth living in both rural and urban communities. The group of participating Native organizations includes the Center for Native American Youth at the Aspen Institute (www.aspeninstitute.org/policy-work/native-american-youth); National American Indian Housing Council (NAIHC) (www.naihc.net/); Native American Contractors Association (http://nativecontractors.org/); National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) (www.ncai.org/); National Council of Urban Indian Health (NCUIH) (www.ncuih.org/); and the Washington Internships for Native Students (WINS) - American University (www.american.edu/spexs/wins/).

11/10/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-265.cfm,HUD Expands Job and Contracting Opportunities for Low-Income Individuals and the Businesses that Hire Them,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced that it is launching a Section 3 Business Registry pilot program in Washington, DC, New Orleans, Detroit, Los Angeles, and Miami that will expand job opportunities for low-income people and public housing residents by registering businesses that currently hire them.
Section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 promotes employment, training, and contracting opportunities to low-income residents who live in communities where HUD funds are spent. As a result, Section 3 promotes self-sufficiency for low-income persons, fosters the creation of small businesses, and helps build strong local economies. For the data received so far, 2010 HUD investments led to 38,000 new jobs- of which 47% were Section 3 hires. Almost 4000 Section 3 business concerns received $475 million in contracts. These numbers should increase as reporting continues.
Under the pilot, HUD's Section 3 Business Registry will offer a searchable online database that housing authorities, local government agencies, and contractors can use to identify firms that have self-certified their status as Section 3 businesses and that hire low-income individuals.
""The business registry is the latest HUD initiative to increase job and contracting opportunities for low-income people and the companies who hire them,"" said John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""What we learn from these five cities will enable local communities across the nation to expand job opportunities through HUD investments.""
Since 2009, HUD has increased Section 3 reporting from 20% to 80% of eligible HUD recipients. HUD has supported recipients by providing technical assistance and training in Section 3 compliance and conducted a listening session of stakeholders from various sectors to hear ideas for improvement. Recent HUD funding enabled 12 local recipients (public housing authorities, states, counties, and cities) to hire full-time Section 3 coordinators.
The Section 3 Business Registry's online database is also intended to make compliance easier for recipients. It will increase the visibility of Section 3 firms and afford them better access to contracting opportunities. In addition, Section 3 residents will be encouraged to use the Section 3 Business Registry to identify businesses that may have employment opportunities they can apply for.
The Section 3 business registry pilot program will run until the fall of 2012. For more information about or to search HUD's new Section 3 Business Registry, go to www.hud.gov/Sec3biz."
11/15/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-270.cfm,FHA Issues Annual Financial Status Report to Congress,"WASHINGTON - The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today released its annual report to Congress on the financial status of the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) Mutual Mortgage Insurance (MMI) Fund. This insurance Fund is the backbone of the FHA single-family and reverse mortgage programs. In reporting on findings of the annual independent actuarial study, HUD indicates that, in the midst of continued weakness in housing markets across the county, the MMI Fund capital ratio remains positive this year at 0.24 percent. With new risk controls and premiums put in place by the Obama Administration, the independent actuaries predict the Fund will return to the Congressionally-mandated threshold of two percent capital more quickly than was projected by last year's review. The economic value of new insurance endorsements in FY 2011 for the Fund was nearly double that of FY 2010 endorsements, being close to $11 billion.
As was the case last year, the new actuarial study shows that FHA is expected to sustain significant losses from loans insured prior to 2009, and thus its capital reserve remains below the congressionally mandated threshold of two percent of total insurance-in-force. However, the actuaries' report concludes that, barring a further significant downturn in home prices, the MMI Fund will start to rebuild capital in 2012, and return to a level of two percent by 2014 – outpacing last year's prediction. The actions taken by this Administration have put FHA into a position where the actuaries expect rapid growth in capital once the housing market begins a broad-based recovery.
""In the midst of a tough housing market the FHA MMI Fund continues to be actuarially sound,"" said Acting FHA Commissioner Carol Galante. ""Because of the Obama Administration's strategy to protect the FHA Fund - tightening of risk controls, increased premiums to stabilize near-term finances, and expanded loss mitigation assistance to avoid unnecessary claims - this past year's endorsements had the highest credit quality ever recorded, and will yield historically high levels of net receipts in the years ahead.""
FHA's capital reserve ratio measures reserves in excess of those needed to cover projected losses over the next 30 years. The independent actuarial reviews of the MMI Fund estimate FHA's capital reserve ratio to be 0.24 percent of total insurance-in-force this year, falling from 0.50 percent in 2010. FHA's total liquid assets (cash plus investments) grew by $800 million since last year, to $33.7 billion. That amount is $1.9 billion higher than at the end of FY 2009, and is also $7.7 billion higher than was predicted last year by the independent actuaries. At the same time, the economic net worth of the Fund fell by $2.1 billion this year, from $4.7 billion to $2.6 billion, as FHA continued to build loss reserves to prepare for greater claims in the coming years.
Losses on loans insured through the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 continue to place a significant strain on the Fund and are expected to reach $26 billion within a few more years. Though they were prohibited in 2009, the ongoing effect of so-called ""seller-funded downpayment assistance loans"" is still significant. The net expected cost of those loans, as projected by the independent actuaries, grew by $1.8 billion over the past year to $14.1 billion. Conversely, the actuaries found that the FY2010 and FY2011 books are expected to be very profitable, providing significant net revenues to offset losses on earlier books. Loans insured to-date under the Obama Administration are providing $18 billion in economic value for the MMI Fund. Under the base-case forecast used by the independent actuaries, the FY 2012 book will add an additional $9 billion in economic value to the Fund.
Since taking office in 2009, the Obama Administration has instituted sweeping reforms to strengthen the MMI Fund. New policies have improved loan quality, strengthened lender enforcement, and helped to protect future loan performance. This has been the most comprehensive update to FHA credit policies, risk management, lender monitoring, and consumer protections in its history. To emphasize this new commitment to risk management, HUD hired the first-ever FHA Chief Risk Officer and established a permanent Risk Office to expand FHA's capacity to assess financial and operational risk, perform more sophisticated data analysis, and respond to market developments. HUD also increased enforcement of FHA lenders, eliminated approval for loan correspondents, and increased net worth requirements for lenders wanting to underwrite FHA loans. Additionally, HUD introduced a new premium structure that better aligns with current market conditions, and it set underwriting minimums that combine credit score and down payment requirements to balance risk management with broad access to housing credit for borrowers who have historically met FHA credit quality standards. Specifically, a minimum down payment of 10 percent is now required of borrowers with credit scores below 580 and applicants with credit scores below 500 are no longer eligible for FHA insurance.
Over this past year, FHA:
Served more than 1.2 million households and insured $218 billion in single-family mortgages, bringing the active single family portfolio to more than $1 trillion. Enabled more than 585,000 families to become homeowners for the first time. This represents 56 percent of all first-time buyers in the nation. Helped more than 362,000 families avoid foreclosure through loss mitigation actions. Helped 440,000 families to refinance their mortgage at lower interest rates, saving households an average of more than $160 per month. Provided access to credit for close to 40 percent of all homebuyers needing mortgages, including 60 percent of all African-American and Hispanic homebuyers. Reduced mortgage payments for 142,000 distressed homeowners through loan modifications. While standard modifications reduced typical payment burdens by 11 percent ($85), FHA HAMP actions reduced average mortgage costs by 24 percent ($218).

11/16/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-266.cfm,Obama Administration Announces $749 Million to Fund Housing for Very Low-Income Seniors and Persons with Disabilities,"WASHINGTON - Thousands more very low-income senior citizens and persons with disabilities will have access to affordable supportive housing thanks to $749 million in housing assistance announced today by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). These grants will help non-profit organizations produce accessible housing, offer rental assistance, and facilitate supportive services for the elderly and persons with disabilities.
The grant funding awarded under HUD's Sections 202 and 811 Supportive Housing programs will kick start construction or major rehabilitation on more than 189 housing developments in 42 different states and Puerto Rico. When complete, more than 4,800 elderly households and persons with disabilities will be affordably housed with access to needed services. Read a detailed summary of each grant.
""The Obama Administration is committed to helping our senior citizens and persons with disabilities find an affordable place to live that is close to needed healthcare services and transportation,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""Recent bipartisan changes to these two supportive housing programs will allow us to better serve some of our more vulnerable populations who would otherwise be struggling to find a safe and decent home of their own.""
Enacted early this year with strong bipartisan support, the Frank Melville Supportive Housing Investment Act and the Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly Act provided needed enhancements and reforms to both programs. Nonprofit grant recipients will now receive federal assistance that is better connected to state and local health care investments, allowing greater numbers of vulnerable elderly and disabled individuals to access the housing they need even more quickly.
Section 202 Capital Advances will provide $545 million nationwide to 97 projects in 31 States and Puerto Rico. In addition to funding the construction, acquisition, and rehabilitation of multifamily developments, HUD's Section 202 program will also provide $54 million in rental assistance so that residents only pay 30 percent of their adjusted incomes. Section 202 provides very low-income elderly persons 62 years of age or older with the opportunity to live independently in an environment that provides support services to meet their unique needs (see attached funding chart).
Section 811 Capital Advances will provide $137 million nationwide to assist very low-income persons with disabilities through 92 projects in 34 states. An additional $12.6 million will be available for project rental assistance contracts (see attached funding chart). Most of the housing supported through the Section 811 Program will be newly constructed, typically small apartment buildings, group homes for three to four persons, or condominium units that are integrated into the larger community. Residents will pay 30 percent of their adjusted income for rent and the federal government will pay the rest.
HUD's Section 811 program provides housing for households with one or more very low-income individuals with a disability. Under this program at least one person must be 18 years or older and have a physical or developmental disability or chronic mental illness. The program provides persons with disabilities the opportunity to live independently in their communities by increasing the supply of rental housing with the availability of supportive services.
HUD provides these funds to non-profit organizations in two forms:
Capital Advances. This is funding that covers the cost of developing, acquiring, or rehabilitating the development. Repayment is not required as long as the housing remains available for occupancy by very low-income elderly persons for at least 40 years for (under Section 202) or very low-income persons with disabilities (under Section 811). Project Rental Assistance Contracts. This is funding that goes to each development to cover the difference between the residents' contributions toward rent and the cost of operating the project.
• Capital Advances. This is funding that covers the cost of developing, acquiring, or rehabilitating the development. Repayment is not required as long as the housing remains available for occupancy by very low-income elderly persons for at least 40 years for (under Section 202) or very low-income persons with disabilities (under Section 811).
• Project Rental Assistance Contracts. This is funding that goes to each development to cover the difference between the residents' contributions toward rent and the cost of operating the project.
Residents must be ""very low income"" with household incomes less than 50 percent of their median for that area. However, most households that receive Section 811 or Section 202 assistance earn less than 30 percent of the median for their area. Generally, this means that a one-person household will have an annual income of about $13,500."
11/16/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-271.cfm,HUD Clarifies Disaster Rules on 'Duplication of Benefits',"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today issued guidance to help state and local governments streamline their HUD-funded disaster recovery programs and ease the burden of complying with federal law prohibiting so-called 'duplication of benefits.' HUD's new guidance (www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2011-11-16/pdf/2011-29634.pdf) clarifies existing rules and offers states consistent direction on this issue.
The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act) requires that recipients of Federal disaster recovery funding make certain that no ""person, business concern or other entity"" will receive duplicative assistance. Because disaster assistance to each person varies widely based on their insurance coverage and eligibility for Federal funding, grantees cannot comply with the Stafford Act without first completing a duplication of benefits analysis specific to each applicant.
As a result, a common struggle for state and local jurisdictions, as well as individuals and businesses, is accounting for the multitude of sources providing assistance following a disaster, such as private insurance, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) grants, and Small Business Administration (SBA) loans. States have been asking for guidance to help improve their grant management and avoid the potential of having to repay federal funds for failure to comply with the Stafford Act's requirements.
Following major disasters, Congress may elect to provide supplemental disaster recovery assistance through HUD's Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program. This assistance is intended to supplement, not replace, other public, private, and nonprofit sector resources that have already been provided for the same need or loss. For example, if a family's damaged home costs $100,000 to repair and the homeowner received $100,000 in insurance proceeds, the homeowner could not also receive federal disaster recovery funds to repair the home. Any additional federal assistance would duplicate the assistance already provided which fully addressed the recovery need.
HUD's guidance responds to that challenge by providing basic frameworks by which state and local grantees can streamline and simplify their duplication of benefit analysis when processing an application for assistance using CDBG disaster recovery funds. It also provides a consistent basis upon which each grantee can develop its own policies and procedures unique to its own disaster recovery programs.
This guidance will also help grantees avoid cases of over-compensation which may result in the recapture and repayment of Federal funds. It also serves as a tool to help ease the administrative burden of administering disaster recovery funds so it can get to where it is needed as quickly as possible while reducing the risk of noncompliance.
HUD is working with its federal partners and developed the guidance in coordination with FEMA and SBA. In connection with today's issuance of this guidance, HUD is also signing a Memorandum of Agreement with the SBA to help ensure that staff and grantees from both agencies understand how CDBG disaster recovery funds may be used to meet disaster needs so that it does not supplant, replace, or duplicate SBA loan proceeds."
11/18/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-272.cfm,"HUD Assistant Secretary Henriquez, Governor De Jongh Cut Ribbon to Open New Affordable Housing on St. Croix","ST.CROIX (U.S. Virgin Islands) - U.S.Department of Housing & Urban Development (HUD) Assistant Secretary Sandra B. Henriquez and U.S.Virgin Islands Governor John de Jongh Jr. today opened the new Louis E. Brown public housing development, replacing the aging development that suffered from multiple hurricanes over the years. The new Louis E. Brown Villas is the Virgin Islands Housing Authority's first affordable housing development in 20 years.
""Cutting this ribbon today marks a new beginning for the residents and the surrounding community,"" said Henriquez. ""The Louis E. Brown redevelopment is kick-starting the local economy, creating hundreds of construction jobs, and providing a new community that St. Croix families will be able to call home.""
Joining Henriquez and the Governor today were Lieutenant Governor Gregory R. Francis; members of the U.S. Virgin Islands 29th Legislature, including Senator Celestino White of the Legislature's Housing Committee; HUD-appointed Board Chair KimberlyWize; and Virgin Islands Housing Authority Executive (VIHA) Director Robert Graham.
The 102 new units opened today are the first part of a three-phase redevelopment plan that will ultimately create 244 one- to three-bedroom units for families and seniors. The developer, Carlisle Development Group, included ""green"" features to conserve power and water which will significantly lower utility costs for residents. These power-saving features include solar thermal water heaters, energy efficient appliances, and rainfall cistern. The new community will also include a community room, library, pedestrian walkways, laundry facility, exercise room, computer lab, recreational area and a playground.
This project generated approximately $32 million worth of investment to the community, including 120 construction jobs for Cruzans. More than a third (37 percent) of all new hires are low- or very-low income neighborhood residents, and 89 percent are minority and women-owned businesses subcontractors. All of the housing will be available to local residents earning 60 percent of the area median income or less, which is $18,660 or less on St. Croix. The redevelopment is being financed with Low-Income Housing Tax Credits from the V.I. Housing Finance Authority, along with funds from HUD.
Founded in 1998, Carlisle Development Group (http://carlisledevelopmentgroup.com/) is one of the largest tax-credit developers in the U.S. With more than 80 projects representing $1.4 billion in total development costs, Carlisle's portfolio of assets includes LEED-certified, mixed-use, transit-oriented, urban infill, historic rehabilitation, as well as mixed-income and market-rate housing developments.
Hurricanes Hugo and Marilyn destroyed most of the 436 units on the 24-acre site. VIHA demolished the damaged units to redevelop the housing. HUD took over the agency in 2003 and brought on Robert Graham as the executive director in 2008."
11/21/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-274.cfm,HUD Announces 2011 Sustainable Communities Awards,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan today announced the recipients of the 2011 Sustainable Communities Grants, totaling nearly $96 million. Twenty-seven communities and organizations will receive Community Challenge grants and 29 regional areas will receive Regional Planning grants. The goal of HUD's Sustainable Communities grants is to help communities and regions improve their economic competitiveness by connecting housing with good jobs, quality schools and transportation (see attached grant chart).
""Our nation's ability to compete in a global economy and create jobs is dependent upon how quickly and efficiently we can connect our workers and families to education and employment opportunities,"" said HUD Secretary Donovan. ""This year we are especially proud that we had a particular focus on funding proposals that included more chambers of commerce and economic development corporations as core partners. These grants will be leveraged with local funds more than doubling the investment and, helping to create new visions for how communities and regions plan for housing, transportation, workforce development and the quality of life of their residents for generations to come. When more than half of the average working family's income is devoted to housing and transportation costs alone, we know that we have a responsibility to fix that and to provide housing and transportation options that can improve their quality of life and economic stability.""
HUD's Community Challenge Grants aim to reform and reduce barriers to achieving affordable, economically vital and sustainable communities. The funds are awarded to communities, large and small, to address local challenges to integrating transportation and housing. Such efforts may include amending or updating local master plans, zoning codes, and building codes to support private sector investment in mixed-use development, affordable housing and the re-use of older buildings. Other local efforts may include retrofitting main streets to provide safer routes for children and seniors, or preserving affordable housing and local businesses near new transit stations.
The Regional Planning Grant program encourages grantees to support regional planning efforts that integrate housing, land-use, economic and workforce development, transportation, and infrastructure developments in a manner that empowers regions to consider how all of these factors work together to create more jobs and economic opportunities. The program will place a priority on partnerships, including the collaboration of arts and culture, philanthropy, and innovative ideas to the regional planning process. Recognizing that areas are in different stages of sustainability planning, HUD has established two categories for the Regional Planning Grant program. The first supports communities that are beginning the conversation about how best to align their housing, transportation, environment, and other infrastructure investments. The second recognizes that some communities have already achieved significant momentum and are prepared to move toward completion and implementation of regional plans for sustainable development.
As was the case last year, the demand for both programs far exceeded the available funding. This year HUD received over $500 million in funding requests from communities in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico for the $96 million in available funding. This year's grants will impact 45.8 million Americans by helping their communities and regions become more efficient and competitive while improving quality of life. Combined with the 87 grants funded last year, this program is providing opportunities for the more than 133 million Americans who live in regions and communities working to shape local plans for how their communities will grow and develop over the next 50 years.
This year's grantees continue to reflect a diverse group of states, regions and communities that believe in sustainability. Grants were awarded in the states of Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Washington and Wyoming.
Community Challenge Grants and Regional Planning Grants are also significantly complimented and leveraged by local, state and private resources. This year, HUD's investment of $95.8 million is garnering $115 million in matching and in-kind contributions - which is over 120% of the Federal investment - from the 56 selected grantees. This brings to total public and private investment for this round of grants to over $211 million. These grants are part of the Partnership for Sustainable Communities, which is represents an association between HUD, the U.S. Department of Transportation, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to ensure that the agencies' policies, programs, and funding consider affordable housing, transportation, and environmental protection together. This interagency collaboration gets better results for communities and uses taxpayer money more efficiently.
Coordinating federal investments in infrastructure, facilities, and services meets multiple economic, environmental, and community objectives with each dollar spent. The Partnership is helping communities across the country to create more housing choices, make transportation more efficient and reliable, reinforce existing investments, and support vibrant and healthy neighborhoods that attract businesses.
""The demand for sustainability grants is very high; we would have needed $500 million to fund all proposals we received this year,"" said HUD Office of Sustainable Housing Communities (OSHC) Director, Shelley Poticha. ""We're confident that the mix of rural and urban proposals that we selected this year will have a great impact in their communities and will create thousands of jobs.""

11/28/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-277.cfm,HUD Secretary Tours Olneyville and Discusses New Housing Refinance Plan and Neighborhood Stabilization Efforts in Rhode Island,"PROVIDENCE - Today, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Shaun Donovan toured four Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) properties on Hyat and Joslin Streets in the Olneyville neighborhood of Providence, RI. Secretary Donovan was joined on the tour by U.S. Senators Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse, Congressmen Jim Langevin and David Cicilline, as well as Providence Mayor Angel Taveras. The tour was aimed at highlighting the success of neighborhood stabilization efforts as well as demonstrating how the American Jobs Act and Project Rebuild can help to revitalize neighborhoods, create jobs, and grow local economies throughout the Providence region. Additionally, the touring delegation discussed the new housing refinancing plan, which will provide a lifeline to many underwater borrowers and strengthen the U.S. housing market.
""Thanks to the City of Providence, the Olneyville Housing Corporation, the Neighborhood Stabilization Program and the vision of Rhode Island's congressional delegation, Olneyville is now well on its way to a successful revitalization,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""Because we can't wait for Congress to act the President recently announced new refinancing options to help underwater borrowers in Rhode Island. But now Congress must step up and pass the American Jobs Act to help rebuild neighborhoods and create jobs in Rhode Island and across the country.""
Four weeks ago the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) announced a set of steps which will help responsible borrowers with little or no equity in their homes take advantage of today's low mortgage rates. The FHFA removed caps for deeply underwater borrowers and cut costs and eliminated refinancing fees. That means more homeowners will have the ability to refinance and save hundreds of dollars each month. Additionally, those who are looking to refinance through this program will finally find competition for their business from other lenders, because the FHFA has removed key frictions that have made lenders reticent to offer new refinancing to underwater borrowers. This will mean better rates and lower costs for borrowers. FHFA also extended the date for homeowners to take advantage of this program through 2013.
""We can do more to help Rhode Island families and improve the housing market. There are too many Americans who have done all the right things - paid their bills on time and are current on their mortgage - but are still stuck in a high interest mortgage because home price declines have made them ineligible for refinancing. The new housing refinance plan includes a series of steps which will help responsible borrowers take advantage of today's record low mortgage rates,"" Secretary Donovan added. ""These new steps will save underwater homeowners thousands of dollars each year, and it will not take an act of Congress. However, there is more work to do by passing the American Jobs Act which includes Project Rebuild, a program which helps put construction workers to work rehabilitating vacant or abandoned homes and businesses. Project Rebuild is an important piece toward stregenthing the housing market and rebuilding our economy.""
Recent HUD statistics have shown that communities with neighborhood stabilization investments have seen 67 percent better home sale price changes, 73 percent saw better vacancy rate improvements, and 47 percent saw better home sale and vacancy rate improvements, as compared to similar communities without neighborhood stabilization improvements.
""I am pleased to have Secretary Donovan back in Rhode Island so he can see firsthand what we have accomplished with neighborhood stabilization funding and what more the state could achieve with additional federal support,"" said U.S. Senator Jack Reed (D-RI), a senior member of the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee.
""These homes tell the story of this neighborhood's hard times, and its fight for renewal. I applaud Secretary Donovan and the Administration for directing resources to the heart of the housing crisis. We need programs like Project Rebuild to help keep communities like Olneyville moving in the right direction,"" said U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI).
""Our economy will not fully turn around unless we stabilize our housing market and Project Rebuild takes an important step toward that goal through partnerships with private organizations, lowering the demand for stressed government resources,"" said U.S. Congressman Jim Langevin (D-RI). ""As the success of the Neighborhood Stabilization Program in Rhode Island has proven, we must support efforts that get our most vulnerable families into stable living situations and reduce blighted neighborhoods, while putting construction workers back on the job.""
""With so many Rhode Islanders and Americans struggling to make ends meet, we do not have a moment to lose. Project Rebuild will help to put Rhode Islanders back to work now making vital repairs and renovations to our communities. We need to invest in rebuilding in our communities now to create jobs and grow our economy,"" said U.S. Congressman David Cicilline (D-RI) who is an original co-sponsor of the Project Rebuild Act of 2011.
The State of Rhode Island has received over $26 million in previous neighborhood stabilization efforts and could receive up to $33 million in Project Rebuild funding.
If approved by Congress, Project Rebuild would invest $15 billion in proven strategies that leverage private capital and expertise to rehabilitate hundreds of thousands of properties in communities across the country. Building on the successful ideas developed during the implementation of the Neighborhood Stabilization Project (NSP), Project Rebuild would include the following innovative ideas:
Allow for the revitalization of commercial properties Include For-Profit Entities to Gain Expertise, Leverage Federal Dollars and Speed Program Implementation Increase Support for ""Land Banking"" Create Jobs Maintaining Properties and Avoid Community Blight
• Allow for the revitalization of commercial properties
• Include For-Profit Entities to Gain Expertise, Leverage Federal Dollars and Speed Program Implementation
• Increase Support for ""Land Banking""
• Create Jobs Maintaining Properties and Avoid Community Blight
Project Rebuild will create nearly 200,000 jobs nationwide and is fundamentally an investment not just in hard hit places but also in the families who live there – the millions of homeowners who have seen their property values decline through no fault of their own, just for being near a foreclosed property. Its inclusion in the American Jobs Act reflects President Obama's belief that rebuilding neighborhoods is essential to rebuilding our economy."
11/28/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-278.cfm,"HUD Launches Web Tool to Connect Best Community Development Efforts to Private, Philanthropic Dollars","WASHINGTON - In an effort to dramatically boost public/private partnerships and philanthropic support for strong community development plans across the country, the Department of Housing & Urban Development (HUD) today unveiled a new web feature to spotlight grantee and top-tier applicant efforts to create opportunity and revitalize regions, communities and neighborhoods around the country. Featured at www.hud.gov, the web tool displays contact information, partnerships, maps and funders for the most robust proposals to HUD's flagship community development initiatives, allowing users to easily find and support local transformation efforts.
""We know that there is an unfulfilled demand in this country for healthy, livable, and prosperous neighborhoods. HUD is committed to transforming how we approach community redevelopment to meet those needs,"" said HUD Assistant Secretary Raphael Bostic. ""Instead of applying a one-size-fits-all design, for the first time, we're seeking to lift up solutions developed at the local level that respond to local needs. This web tool will help the strongest applicants from across HUD's programs to connect with philanthropic partners - private foundations, corporations, and family and community foundations - and explore ways to leverage federal investment to increase impact in their neighborhoods.""
""Now more than ever, smart community development efforts require government, business, and foundations to combine their resources,"" said Mimi Corcoran, director of the Special Fund for Poverty Alleviation at the Open Society Foundations. ""HUD's new web tool facilitates these partnerships, helping people revitalize their neighborhoods across the country.""
The first applicants to be featured on http://Partner.HUD.gov come from HUD's Choice Neighborhoods Initiative - a centerpiece of the Obama Administration's interagency Neighborhood Revitalization Initiative. The partnership includes HUD , Education, Justice, Treasury and Health and Human Services and supports local leaders from the public and private sectors as they attract the private investment needed to transform distressed neighborhoods into sustainable, mixed-income neighborhoods with the affordable housing, safe streets and good schools every family needs. As part of the Administration's commitment to a more transparent grant process, later updates will include information on high-scoring applications from HUD's Sustainable Communities initiative and other programs to deepen the partnerships at the local level.
In 2011, HUD awarded over $129 million in Choice Neighborhoods funding to 22 communities preparing to take on this work. To date, the grantees have obtained a combined $7.3 million dollars in leveraged funding - nearly double their total grant award - as stakeholder partners committed their resources to planning the transformation of their neighborhoods. HUD's first Choice Neighborhoods Implementation Grants - awarded to Chicago, Boston, New Orleans, San Francisco and Seattle - received a combined $122 million in late August to redevelop distressed housing and bring comprehensive neighborhood revitalization to blighted areas. Thosegrantees have leveraged a additional $1.6 billion - more than 13 times their total grant award - including refocused and streamlined funds from private investors, cities, universities, and a range of local partners.
However, because Choice Neighborhoods is a competitive grant program, strong demand has outpaced available funding. HUD received over 150 applications from public, private, and nonprofit sponsors in 31 states and the District of Columbia. Due to the limited amount of funding, HUD was able to issue only five of implementation grants, and 17 smaller planning grants - leaving several strong applications that HUD was simply not able to fund and many more grantees eager to attract additional resources to their transformation plans.
In response, HUD is publishing - for the first time - comprehensive information about grantees and qualified applicants on an innovative online platform. The web-based tool includes winners of the first Choice Neighborhoods Planning and Implementation awards as well as high scoring runners-up from those competitions. The http://Partner.HUD.gov web feature is intended to provide information funders and other local stakeholders can use to propel applications that HUD deemed promising, but was unable to fund. It will also offer communities greater access to work happening around the country and best-practice models that might help shape their efforts."

The $37.1 million loan is made possible through the Federal Housing Administration's (FHA) Section 242 Hospital Mortgage Insurance Program.
Knox Community Hospital is a not-for-profit healthcare provider operating a 115-bed acute care facility. Proceeds from the loan will be used forrenovation of operating rooms, expansion of the catheterization laboratory for diagnostic and interventional cardiac services, and implementation of a hospital-wide electronic health records system. Construction cost is $21.2 million. In addition, $15.9 million of 2004 revenue bonds will be refinanced.
""By helping to make projects like this possible, FHA is not only improving the community's health care, it is also contributing to the area's financial well-being by creating jobs and supporting local economies,"" said FHA Acting Commissioner Carol Galante.
HUD estimates that the Knox Community Hospital construction project will support approximately 328 full-time jobs and provide an economic boost of $61 million to the community. HUD's estimates are based on results from an economic model used by public and private institutions to examine a variety of economic development issues. Knox Community Hospital representatives estimate that, following construction completion, the hospital will support a full-time employment base of approximately 730 jobs.
By insuring the mortgage loan, FHA is enabling the hospital to obtain lower cost financing that will save an estimated$8.5 million in interest costs over the life of the loan. Since 1968, FHA has insured 401 mortgage loans totaling $17.4 billion to hospitals in 43 states and Puerto Rico.
FHA's Section 242 Mortgage Insurance Program for Hospitals provides HUD-insured mortgages made by private lending institutions to finance construction or renovation of acute care hospitals including major equipment needed to operate the facility. Eligible applicants can be public, proprietary, or nonprofit hospitals certified by the responsible State agency."

These grants will be awarded competitively to hundreds of HUD-approved counseling agencies and State Housing Finance Agencies across the nation that offer a variety of services including how to avoid foreclosure, how to avoid mortgage scams, how to purchase or rent a home, how to improve credit scores, and how to qualify for a reverse mortgage.
""The HUD-approved counseling programs this funding will support not only help families make more informed choices about buying or renting, it is crucial in helping thousands of families avoid foreclosure and remain in their homes,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""We fought hard to persuade Congress to restore funding for housing counseling in HUD's Fiscal Year 2012 budget and I'm pleased that they did so. We will now work to make these important resources available to help families as quickly as possible.""
HUD-approved counseling agencies also provide counseling as well as financial literacy education to renters and homeless individuals and families. This year HUD's Housing Counseling Grant program will provide $36.05 million for comprehensive counseling and $4 million for Reverse Mortgage Counseling.
National and regional agencies distribute much of HUD's housing counseling grant funding to HUD- approved community-based housing counseling organizations that provide information and guidance to low- and moderate-income families seeking to improve their housing conditions. These larger organizations help improve the quality of housing counseling services and enhance coordination among their counseling providers. In addition, HUD approved counseling agencies provide services in a variety of languages to meet to the needs of the population in the service area as well as ensuring communications and access is provided for persons with disabilities.
HUD will award grants to approximately 500 applicants. Instructions are posted on Grants.gov. To apply, go to https://apply07.grants.gov/apply/forms_apps_idx.html and enter 14.169 in the CFDA field.

12/02/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-281.cfm,"HUD Selects German Marshall Fund to Manage Strong Cities, Strong Communities Fellowship Program","WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced its selection of the German Marshall Fund (GMF) partnership as the recipient of the $2.5 million award to manage the Strong Cities, Strong Communities (SC2) fellowship program for HUD. The partnership is comprised of the German Marshall Fund, Cleveland State University and Virginia Tech. The fellowship program is one of four capacity building strategies that are part of the White House-led, federal interagency SC2 initiative. SC2 is a pilot program focused on retooling and rebuilding the capacity of cities facing long-term economic challenges. Up to 30 fellows will be assigned to the six SC2 cities (Chester, PA; Detroit, MI; New Orleans, LA; Fresno, CA; Memphis, TN; and Cleveland, OH).
""The fellows participating in Strong Cities Strong Communities Initiative will bring with them a unique set of expertise which, combined with real hands-on experience responding to economic issues, will produce innovative result to help build local economies and create jobs,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""The six cities currently participating are critical to America's prosperity and future economic growth, and are currently undergoing economic, demographic and urban planning changes to which the assigned fellows will be able to significantly contribute.""
To fund the fellowship program, last year, the Rockefeller Foundation donated $2.5 million to HUD to manage and implement the fellowship program. In August 2011, HUD published a 30-day competition notice, ""Request for Qualification (RFQ) for the Fellowship Placement Pilot Program"" to identify a qualified third party, or a partnership of third parties to manage and administer the fellowship program. The GMF partnership was the winning proposal and will be responsible for implementing and administering the fellowship program, which includes the following tasks:
• Identifying, selecting and recruiting qualified candidates for the fellowship program;
• Coordinating with local organizations in each pilot city;
• Working with each pilot city to ensure that fellows are well integrated with their pilot city and working on strategic projects;
• Developing orientation materials for fellows entering the program;
• Developing or applying existing training curriculum that will equip fellows with the fundamental knowledge, tools and skills they would need to be successful in the program; and
• Identifying additional training and mentoring opportunities fellows may require as they progress through the program.
""The Strong Cities Strong Communities Initiative represents a new and innovative way for the federal government to work with local governments, the private sector, and institutions of higher learning to support local economic growth and encourage community development,"" said Melody Barnes, White House Domestic Policy Council Director. ""The Strong Cities Strong Communitiesfellowship program will give these cities a class of highly-skilled fellows who are committed to public service, and who will become our next generation of leaders.""
""The Rockefeller Foundation is thrilled to support the Strong Cities Strong Communities Initiative, as part of our commitment to help vulnerable populations build resilience,"" said Rockefeller Foundation President Judith Rodin. ""The selected fellows will bring new innovation to cities like New Orleans and Detroit in these rapidly changing times, and lend increased energy to communities that are already working to find ways to be resilient during a difficult economic period.""
The fellowship program will be a competitive program that provides funding for early to mid-career professionals to work for 24 months in pilot cities to supplement existing local capacity. HUD envisioned that through a national competitive process, up to 30 fellows who are strongly committed to public service will be selected for the initial fellowship class. Fellows will be deployed to one of the six pilot cities to support local governments in their economic revitalization efforts with the hopes that fellows will remain working in the city after the end of the program. The objectives of fellows assigned to selected pilot cities are as follows:
• Take on strategic responsibilities and be immersed in the core operations of the pilot city;
• Engage in peer-to-peer learning opportunities and become active leaders in their pilot city; and
• Be intensely engaged and committed to the redevelopment of the city so that they remain working in the city after the end of the program.
In addition to building the capacity of local governments, SC2 aims to encourage partnerships among local community organizations, anchor institutions, businesses, foundations and government agencies, to help leverage federal investments. In addition to the fellowship program, there are three other components to SC2:
SC2 Community Solutions Teams: Community Solutions Teams (CST) comprised of federal employees from several different agencies will work directly with the mayors of the six SC2 cities. These teams will assist cities with issues mayors have identified as vital to their economic strategies, including efforts to build on local assets, strengthen regional economies, develop transportation infrastructure, improve job-training programs and support community revitalization. In Detroit, CST will be composed of representatives from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, U.S. Department of Labor, U.S. Department of Transportation, U.S. Department of Commerce and the Small Business Administration SC2 Economic Planning Challenge: In addition to the six pilot locations, SC2 includes an Economic Planning Challenge designed to help additional cities develop economic blueprints. This national grant competition will enable cities to adopt and implement innovative economic development strategies to support comprehensive city and regional planning efforts. Six cities will be competitively selected to receive a grant of approximately $1 million that they will use to administer an ""X-prize style"" competition, whereby they will challenge multi-disciplinary teams of experts to develop comprehensive economic and land use proposals for their city. The competition will be administered by EDA. National Resource Network: Pending authorization of funding, the National Resource Network (NRN) will aggregate public and private resources to provide a broader set of cities, towns and regions with access to a one-stop portal of national experts to provide holistic policy and implementation support. Once funds are secured, HUD will host a competition to select an intermediary to manage the network. Cities, towns and regions will apply to get access to NRN, and outside experts will apply to be able to provide consulting services through NRN. A menu of customized and comprehensive technical assistance in a variety of policy areas will be available to communities, and will be delivered through on-site training and staff development. NRN will also foster peer-to-peer learning to strengthen the network of urban practitioners and thinkers.

SC2 pilot cities were selected on the basis of economic need, strong local leadership and collaboration, potential for economic growth, geographic diversity, and the ability to test the SC2 model across a range of environments. Federal assessment teams spent time on the ground working directly with mayors and other local officials to determine needs, opportunities and gather input for the pilot initiative."
12/02/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-283.cfm,Joplin Public Housing Authority Executive Director Honored with HUD Secretarial Award,"WASHINGTON - Immediately after a raging E-5 tornado destroyed thousands of homes in Joplin, Missouri last May, Matt Moran jumped into action. The executive director of the Housing Authority of Joplin immediately made certain residents were safe and worked quickly to provide housing for those forced from their homes.
Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development presented Moran with the prestigious HUD Secretarial Award for his commitment and dedication in the early hours and days following that killer storm.
""Matt went above and beyond the call of duty immediately following this deadly tornado,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""He is the epitome of what a public employee and a leader should be. His compassion and quick actions speak volumes about his devotion to Joplin and public service.""
Region VII Administrator Derrith Watchman-Moore added, ""There is no way to adequately describe Matt's contributions to the Joplin community. His leadership immediately following the tornado reveals the depth of his commitment and dedication to his neighbors.""
Soon after the tornado touched down in Joplin, Moran acted quickly and drove to public housing developments to locate residents, offering them assistance and directing them to safe temporary housing. He also located each one of his own employees to ensure they were all safe. The day after the storm, Moran and several public housing authority employees rallied to expedite the work of locating residents and provide temporary housing and rebuilding. Within days, he placed 11 vacant units back into service, a critical move when so many families faced the prospect of becoming homeless. Within two days, he worked to place insurance adjusters on the scene to assess the damage to public housing units and to formulate a plan and schedule for rebuilding.
The tornado destroyed 103 public housing units in Joplin, leaving 99 residents with no home of their own. In addition, the storm severely damaged the privately owned homes of 85 Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) recipients."
12/05/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-284.cfm,Obama Administration Awards $23.7 Million to Produce More Assisted Living Senior Housing in Five States,"WASHINGTON - Elderly Americans in Connecticut, Indiana, Minnesota, New York and Ohio will soon find themselves living in upgraded apartments equipped to meet their physical needs because of $23.7 million in grants from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. HUD today announced the grants to help convert existing multifamily projects into assisted living facility for the elderly. A detailed summary of each grant is attached to this release.
The funding is provided through HUD's Assisted Living Conversion Program which provides grants for the physical conversion of eligible multifamily assisted housing projects or portions of projects to assisted living facilities.
""The funding we announce today will allow the elderly an opportunity to age in place in familiar surroundings as they become older and require supportive services,"" said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan. ""These grants will provide an affordable option to nursing homes, helping seniors to live independently.""
Assisted living facilities are designed to accommodate low-income frail elderly persons and persons with disabilities who can live independently but need assistance with the activities of daily living such as help with eating, bathing, grooming, dressing and home management activities. These affordable facilities provide support services such as personal care, transportation, meals, and housekeeping.
The grants are awarded on a competitive basis. During the review process, HUD assesses several ranking factors including: the extent to which the conversion is needed by the persons that the project is intended to serve; the quality and effectiveness of the proposal in addressing the proposed conversion including the meals and supportive services which the project intends to provide; the ability of the project owner to secure other community resources which can be combined with the grant to achieve the program's purposes; and the capacity of the project owner to carry out the conversion in a timely and effective manner.
The owners are responsible for ensuring that converted units meet all local standards, codes and regulations governing assisted living facilities. The projects must also be licensed and regulated by the appropriate governing body."

Henriquez announced today that HUD is joining forces with GreatSchools, a national non-profit educational resource for parents. The intent of this new partnership is to give parents living in public housing or who receive HUD Housing Choice Voucher rental assistance greater access to local school information that will help them make more informed decisions about where to send their children to school.
""Every parent wants the best for their kids and the partnership we launch today will give families in our rental assistance programs the tools they need to find the very best educational opportunities for their children,"" said Henriquez. ""When a parent chooses a home, they also choose the teachers, parents and resources in their neighborhood school. This partnership uses housing as a platform for educational opportunity by providing parents with greater access to critical school information that will help put their kids on the path to success.""
""Education has always been the most assured path to opportunity and realizing the American Dream,"" said Jim Shelton, assistant deputy secretary for Innovation and Improvement at the U.S. Department of Education. ""We are proud to support this important partnership between HUD and GreatSchools to ensure that all families have access to the information and resources they need to find quality schools.""
""Choosing schools is one of the most important decisions parents make, and the opportunities for parents to choose among different schools continue to increase,"" said Bill Jackson, CEO and founder of GreatSchools. ""We are thrilled to partner with HUD to provide millions of American families with access to easy-to-understand information about schools in their communities. Together, HUD and GreatSchools can help many families discover and attend schools of their choice, which can make a real difference for their children's futures.""
Based in San Francisco, GreatSchools is a national non-profit organization that supports parents through a wide variety of web-based resources available at www.greatschools.org. The organization's flagship offering is a database of school performance information for more than 200,000 public, private and charter schools across the U.S. The user-friendly website also has information about how parents can help their children achieve success in PreK-12, including subject-area worksheets, homework help and college preparation.
GreatSchools and HUD are joining to give parents living in public housing or who receive rental assistance through HUD's Housing Choice Voucher Program the tools to make informed educational choices for their children and become even more involved in their children's education. For example, GreatSchools will provide housing authorities informational materials, including a video tutorial, tailored to housing authorities and parents. GreatSchools has also developed a factsheet outlining the essential steps to choosing the right school. HUD will encourage housing authorities' executive directors to offer these resources to parents and include a portal to GreatSchools on their agency website.
In a letter this month, HUD Assistant Secretary Henriquez asked the nation's 3,200 public housing authorities to support the partnership by making the GreatSchools website and supplemental materials about local schools easily accessible to HUD-assisted families with school-aged children. Providing these materials when families first obtain a voucher or during their annual recertification would give them timely access to information about schools, test scores and extracurricular activities in any community they live or choose to live. Information can also be shared in resident newsletters or at resident meetings.
The HUD-GreatSchools partnership is part of HUD's greater commitment to using housing assistance to improve educational outcomes of low-income families. HUD's Choice Neighborhoods Program, which awarded communities $65 million this year to transform distressed HUD-assisted housing into sustainable, mixed-income neighborhoods, extends the neighborhood transformation efforts beyond public housing to link housing intervention with education. Successful grantees were required to include in their applications plans to develop quality early childhood education programs. Congress recently showed bipartisan support for the Choice program with a $120 million appropriation for Fiscal Year 2012.
Earlier this year, HUD also awarded five public housing authorities a combined $15 million from HUD's Capital Fund Education and Training Community Facilities Program to create early childhood education and adult training facilities for public housing residents."

""Families who may have been forced from their homes need to know that help is available to begin the rebuilding process,"" said Donovan. ""Whether it's foreclosure relief for FHA-insured families or helping these counties to recover, HUD stands ready to help in any way we can.""
Offering the State of New Hampshire and other entitlement communities the ability to re-allocate existing federal resources toward disaster relief - HUD's Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and HOME programs give the State and communities the flexibility to redirect millions of dollars to address critical needs, including housing and services for disaster victims. HUD is currently contacting State and local officials to explore streamlining the Department's CDBG and HOME programs in order to expedite the repair and replacement of damaged housing; Granting immediate foreclosure relief - HUD granted a 90-day moratorium on foreclosures and forbearance on foreclosures of Federal Housing Administration (FHA)-insured home mortgages; Making mortgage insurance available - HUD's Section 203(h) program provides FHA insurance to disaster victims who have lost their homes and are facing the daunting task of rebuilding or buying another home. Borrowers from participating FHA-approved lenders are eligible for 100 percent financing, including closing costs; Making insurance available for both mortgages and home rehabilitation - HUD's Section 203(k) loan program enables those who have lost their homes to finance the purchase or refinance of a house along with its repair through a single mortgage. It also allows homeowners who have damaged houses to finance the rehabilitation of their existing single-family home; and Offering Section 108 loan guarantee assistance - HUD will offer state and local governments federally guaranteed loans for housing rehabilitation, economic development and repair of public infrastructure. Information on housing providers and HUD programs - The Department will share information with FEMA and the State on housing providers that may have available units in the impacted counties. This includes Public Housing Agencies and Multi-Family owners. The Department will also connect FEMA and the State to subject matter experts to provide information on HUD programs and providers.

12/07/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-287.cfm,Obama Administration Releases November Housing Scorecard,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of the Treasury today released the November edition of the Obama Administration's Housing Scorecard - a comprehensive report on the nation's housing market. Included in this month's report are detailed assessments for the 10 largest mortgage servicers participating in the Making Home Affordable Program with results from the third quarter of 2011. In addition to providing greater transparency about servicer performance in the program, the servicer assessments - first introduced in June 2011 and published quarterly - are intended to set a new industry benchmark for disclosure around servicer efforts to assist struggling homeowners, while prompting them to correct identified deficiencies.
""The mortgage servicing industry lacked accountability and transparency when this crisis started,"" said Treasury Assistant Secretary for Financial Stability Tim Massad. ""Publishing these servicer assessments is key to our efforts to hold servicers publicly accountable for their performance and keep necessary pressure on them to improve. We've seen movement in the right direction, and we will keep this up so that the industry continues to change its ways.""
Since the inception of the Making Home Affordable Program, Treasury has required participating servicers to take specific actions to improve their servicing processes to more effectively assist struggling homeowners. The latest Servicer Assessments summarize performance on three categories of program implementation: identifying and contacting homeowners; homeowner evaluation and assistance; and program reporting, management and governance. For the third quarter of 2011, only JPMorgan Chase, NA was found to be in need of substantial improvement under the program. While JPMorgan Chase demonstrated some progress in areas reported for the third quarter, the servicer has a number of outstanding items from previous quarters that have not yet been addressed and play a critical part in their broader execution of the program. For these reasons, Treasury will withhold servicer incentives from JPMorgan Chase for the third consecutive quarter and will permanently reduce incentives owed to JPMorgan Chase unless the outstanding items are addressed before the next assessment.
Bank of America, NA was found to be in need of moderate improvement for the third quarter of 2011 but will continue to have its servicer incentives for previous quarters withheld. Although Bank of America has not yet remediated all of the areas previously identified as requiring substantial improvement from the previous quarter, it has made progress in addressing a number of items.
The assessments indicate that servicers have been focusing attention on areas identified through regular compliance and program reviews. For example, the error rate with respect to servicers' calculations of homeowner income has declined from an average of 17.5 percent as of the first quarter of 2011 to 3.8 percent as of the third quarter (income calculation is used to determine eligibility and payment amount for the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP)). More information about the results reported in the Administration's Servicer Assessments for the third quarter of 2011 can be found at http://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/financial-stability/results/MHA-Reports/Pages/default.aspx.
As the Administration continues to push servicers to provide more effective assistance to struggling homeowners through its foreclosure prevention programs, the ongoing fragility of the housing market demonstrates the need for the Administration's recovery efforts in hard hit communities. The November Housing Scorecard features key data on the health of the housing market and the impact of the Administration's foreclosure prevention programs, including:
The Administration's recovery efforts continue to help millions of families deal with the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. More than 5.4 million modification arrangements were started between April 2009 and the end of October 2011 - including more than 1.7 million HAMP trial modification starts, more than 1.1 million FHA loss mitigation and early delinquency interventions, and more than 2.5 million proprietary modifications under HOPE Now. While some homeowners may have received help from more than one program, the total number of agreements offered continues to more than double the number of foreclosure completions for the same period (2.4 million). As of October, more than 880,000 permanent mortgage modifications have occurred through HAMP, with a median payment reduction for the homeowner of 37 percent. Eligible homeowners entering HAMP have a high likelihood of earning a permanent modification and realizing long-term success. Eighty-two percent of eligible homeowners entering a HAMP trial modification since June 1, 2010 received a permanent modification, with an average trial period of 3.5 months. Homeowners in HAMP permanent modifications have saved an estimated $9.4 billion to date. View the October MHA Performance Report.

Also featured this month is the Administration's Housing Scorecard Regional Spotlight on market strength in Atlanta, Georgia and surrounding communities. The Atlanta metro area was one of the hardest hit areas in the nation following the housing market downturn and an area where the Administration's broad approach to stabilizing the housing market has been very active.
Despite growing evidence of progress in the broader economy, the housing data in this month's Scorecard offer continued mixed signals and some signs of weakness in the market,"" said HUD Assistant Secretary Raphael Bostic. ""The Administration remains committed to helping all homeowners who have been hit hard during this housing crisis, and as the Regional Spotlight shows our efforts have helped over 135,000 families avoid foreclosure in Atlanta. But we have much more work to do to reach the many households who still face trouble and to help the market recover.
The bi-monthly Housing Scorecard Regional Spotlight features data on the health of the Atlanta housing market and impact of efforts to help homeowners at the local level including:
The Atlanta market is under pressure from a high percentage of distressed mortgages, deeply discounted foreclosed properties, low property values, and many severely underwater mortgages. Although the share of distressed mortgages in and around Atlanta - those 90 or more days delinquent, in foreclosure, or bank owned - has been above the national average since mid-2000, the local foreclosure crisis has generally mirrored that of the nation as a whole, with a significant rise in delinquencies and defaults among high-cost subprime loans beginning in 2007. Moreover, the home sales market remains sluggish in Atlanta as local home prices have shown signs of rebounding since early 2009, but remain at low levels not seen in more than a decade. More than 135,000 Atlanta households have received mortgage modifications, many through direct Administration programs. Since April 1, 2009 135,800 mortgage assistance interventions have been offered to homeowners in the Atlanta metropolitan area. More than 114,300 interventions were offered through HAMP and the FHA loss mitigation and early delinquency intervention programs. An estimated additional 21,500 proprietary modifications have been offered through HOPE Now Alliance servicers. While some homeowners may have received help from more than one program, more assistance has been offered than foreclosures completed during this period (92,800). The Administration's Hardest Hit Fund and Neighborhood Stabilization Programs have fueled local foreclosure prevention efforts and market stability. Georgia has received more than $339 million through the Hardest Hit Fund to implement local solutions to borrower mortgage defaults and address the range of factors that contribute to a family's financial problems. Moreover, approximately $91.2 million has been awarded to seven jurisdictions through the Neighborhood Stabilization Program to help purchase or redevelop residential properties and address the effects of abandoned and foreclosed housing. In addition, the State of Georgia has received an additional $97 million toward neighborhood stabilization. Both programs have helped provide stability to the Atlanta housing market.

12/13/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-288.cfm,Obama Administration Announces Decline in Homelessness in 2011,"WASHINGTON - On a single night last January, 636,017 people were homeless in the United States, a 2.1 percent decline from the year before. That's the key finding of a new count on homelessness announced today by U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan. Donovan made the announcement at a meeting of the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness where he was joined by HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius and Labor Secretary Hilda Solis.
HUD's annual ""point in time"" estimate of the number of homeless persons and families is based on data reported by more than 3,000 cities and counties. While number of homeless persons vary locally, these communities are reporting modest declines in homelessness in every category or subpopulation including individuals, families, veterans and those experiencing long-term or chronic homelessness.
Donovan, who personally participated in the 2011 nighttime count said, ""It's remarkable that in the wake of the most serious economic crisis since the Great Depression, we're witnessing an across-the-board drop in homelessness. This tells us that the Obama Administration's homelessness strategy is working and the results spur us to continue working to end homelessness in America once and for all.""
""These numbers are a step in the right direction, especially for some of our more vulnerable populations such as veterans,"" said Secretary Solis, who served as chair of the Interagency Council in 2011. ""With many working families continuing to struggle, the President's plan will allow us to redouble our efforts to end and prevent homelessness.""
""Reducing homelessness among Veterans by 12 percent since January 2010 is a clear sign of progress, but our work is not complete until no Veteran has to sleep on the street,"" said Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric K. Shinseki. ""We have been successful in achieving this milestone due to strong leadership from the President and hard work by countless community organizations and our federal, state, and local partners who are committed to helping Veterans and their families get back on their feet.""
During one night in late January of 2011, local planners or ""Continuums of Care"" across the nation conducted a one-night count of their sheltered and unsheltered homeless populations. These one-night 'snapshot' counts are then reported to HUD as part of state and local grant applications. While the data reported to HUD does not directly determine the level of a community's grant funding, these estimates, as well as full-year counts to be released later next year, are crucial in understanding the scope of homelessness and measuring progress in reducing it.
The Obama Administration's strategic plan to end homelessness is called Opening Doors - a roadmap by 19 federal member agencies of the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness along with local and state partners in the public and private sectors. The plan puts the country on a path to end veterans and chronic homelessness by 2015; and to ending homelessness among children, family, and youth by 2020. The Plan presents strategies building upon the lesson that mainstream housing, health, education, and human service programs must be fully engaged and coordinated to prevent and end homelessness.
""Over the last 18 months, we've seen unprecedented levels of collaboration within the federal government,"" said U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness Executive Director Barbara Poppe. ""The federal government is partnering more effectively with states and local communities across the nation to align our efforts to make progress on the goals of Opening Doors.""
The reductions reported today are attributed in part to the impact of HUD's $1.5 billion Homeless Prevention and Rapid Re-housing Program (HPRP), a program designed to assist individuals and families confronted by a sudden economic crisis. Funded through the Recovery Act, HPRP spared more than one million persons from homelessness by offering them short-term rent assistance, security and utility deposits, and moving expenses. The US Conference of Mayors has described HPRP as ""fundamentally changing"" the way communities respond to homelessness.
In addition, HUD and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs are collaborating on a joint program called HUD-VA Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH). To date, this targeted rental assistance program provided more than 33,000 homeless veterans permanent supportive housing through rental vouchers provided by HUD along with supportive services and case management by VA. The national estimate announced today reveal a particularly large decrease in the number of homeless veterans - nearly 12 percent.
Key Findings of HUD's estimate:
On a single night in January 2011, HUD and its partners found:
636,017 people were homeless, a reduction of 2.1 percent (649,917) from January 2010, and 5.3 percent (671,888) since 2007. Veteran homelessness fell by nearly 12 percent (or 8,834 persons) since January 2010. Homelessness among individuals declined 2 percent (or 13,900) from a year ago and 5.6 percent since 2007. Meanwhile, the number of homeless families fell 2.8 percent from last year and 8 percent since 2007. Street homelessness (the unsheltered homeless population) declined by 13 percent (or 36,786 people) since 2007. Persons experiencing long-term or chronic homelessness declined 2.4 percent (or 2,664) from last year and 13.5 percent (or 16,635 persons) since 2007. This steep reduction in chronic homelessness is largely attributed to the sharp growth in the supply of permanent supportive housing units - more than 30,000 beds between 2010 and 2011, and by more than 83,000 since 2007. Five states accounted for half of the nation's total homeless population: California (21.4 percent); New York (10 percent); Florida (8.9 percent); Texas (5.8 percent); and Georgia (3.3 percent).

12/13/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-289.cfm,"HUD, VA to Provide Permanent Housing, Support to Homeless Vets in U.S.","WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric K. Shinseki announced today that HUD will provide $2.4 million to public housing agencies to supply permanent housing and case management for homeless veterans in the U.S.
This funding, from HUD's Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing Program (HUD-VASH), is a coordinated effort by HUD, VA, and local housing agencies to provide permanent housing for homeless veterans. Today's funding will support 435 vouchers in 18 communities.
This funding to local housing agencies is part of the Obama Administration's commitment to end Veteran and long-term chronic homelessness by 2015. Opening Doors: Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness (www.usich.gov/PDF/FactSheetVeterans.pdf) serves as a roadmap for how the federal government will work with state and local communities to confront the root causes of homelessness, especially among former servicemen and women. Since 2008, HUD-VASH has provided more than 33,000 homeless veterans permanent supportive housing and supportive services.
""During this season of giving, I'm thrilled to announce that we have evidence that this funding is making a real difference to get homeless veterans off the street and into homes they can call their own,"" said HUD Secretary Donovan. ""Thanks to the work done by HUD, and agency partners across the Obama Administration, the most recent homeless estimate shows veteran homelessness fell by nearly 12 percent in just one year.""
""This program provides critical assistance to those who have worn our nation's military uniforms and are in need of a home,"" said VA Secretary Shinseki. ""VA and HUD will continue to work in partnership to end homelessness among veterans.""
Today HUD also released its latest estimate on homelessness in America and found, veteran homelessness fell by nearly 12 percent (or 8,834 people) since January 2010.
The vouchers awarded today are part of the $50 million appropriated for Fiscal Year 2011 to support the housing needs of 7,250 homeless veterans. VA Medical Centers (VAMC) provide supportive services and case management to eligible homeless veterans. Earlier this year, HUD awarded $46.2 million in HUD-VASH funding.
Homeless veterans are referred to the public housing agencies for these vouchers, based upon a variety of factors, most importantly the need for case management services. The HUD-VASH program includes both the rental assistance the voucher provides and the comprehensive case management that VAMC staff provides.
Veterans participating in the HUD-VASH program rent privately owned housing and generally contribute no more than 30 percent of their income toward rent. VA offers eligible homeless veterans clinical and supportive services through its medical centers across the U.S., Guam and Puerto Rico."
12/20/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-290.cfm,"HUD Awards $1.5 Billion to More Than 7,100 Local Homeless Programs","WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Shaun Donovan today awarded $1.47 billion to renew funding to more than 7,100 local homeless programs operating across the country. The funding announced today will ensure these housing and service programs remain operating in 2012 and are a critical part of the Obama Administration's strategic plan to prevent and end homelessness. View a complete list of all the state and local homeless assistance programs awarded funding on HUD's website.
The funding announced today is $62 million more than last year, the most homeless assistance ever awarded by the Department. HUD is renewing funding through its Continuum of Care programs to existing local programs as quickly as possible to prevent any interruption in federal assistance and will award funds to new projects in early 2012.
""The grants we're awarding today will literally keep the doors of our shelters open and will help those on the front lines of ending homelessness do what they do best,"" said Donovan. ""It's incredible that as we work to recover from the greatest economic decline since the Great Depression, the total number of homeless Americans is declining, in large part because of these funds.""
Last week, HUD announced its 2011 ""point in time"" estimate of the number of homeless persons in America. Approximately 3,000 cities and counties reported 636,000 homeless persons on a single night in January of 2011, a 2.1 percent decline from the year before. This documented reduction in homelessness was noticed among all population groups including individuals, families, and those experiencing long-term or chronic homeless. In addition, HUD's estimate reveals a 12 percent reduction in homelessness among veterans.
HUD's Continuum of Care grants announced today provide permanent and transitional housing to homeless persons as well as services including job training, health care, mental health counseling, substance abuse treatment and child care. Continuum of Care grants are awarded competitively to local programs to meet the needs of their homeless clients. These grants fund a wide variety of programs from street outreach and assessment programs to transitional and permanent housing for homeless persons and families.
Last year, President Obama and 19 federal agencies and offices that form the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH) launched the nation's first comprehensive strategy to prevent and end homelessness. Opening Doors: Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness (www.usich.gov/OpeningDoors.html) puts the country on a path to end veterans and chronic homelessness by 2015 and to ending homelessness among children, family, and youth by 2020.
In addition to HUD's annual grant awards, HUD continues to manage the $1.5 billion Homelessness Prevention and Rapid Re-housing (HPRP) Program. Made possible through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, this three-year grant program is intended to prevent persons from falling into homelessness or to rapidly re-house them if they do. To date, more than one million persons have been assisted through HPRP."
12/22/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-291.cfm,HUD Expands Services to Communicate with the Public in 175 Languages,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced that it has launched the HUD Language Line, a telephone language service pilot that will offer live, one-on-one interpretation services in more than 175 languages. Accessible throughout the nation, the language line will help HUD staff to better communicate with Limited English Proficient (LEP) individuals and families about HUD housing programs, services, and activities.
""Access to government should not be determined by how well a person speaks English,"" said John Trasviña, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""The HUD Language Line is another example of HUD's efforts to ensure that persons with limited English proficiency have equal access to HUD programs and services.""
This pilot program will run through September 2012. HUD staff across the nation will be able to use the HUD Language Line to provide non English-speaking individuals and families with information about fair housing, homeownership, lead abatement, housing assistance, and other HUD programs and services. When a person with limited English proficiency contacts the Department, the HUD staff person taking the call will contact the Language Line and speak with a live operator, who will connect the caller and HUD staff person with an interpreter who speaks the caller's language.
Congress appropriated funds to HUD under the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2010 to help ensure that individuals have access to information in languages other than English regarding HUD programs, services and activities.
HUD also offers a Limited English Proficiency website to promote equal access to housing programs by providing important HUD documents in 18 different languages. HUD's expanded LEP website features factsheets, housing brochures and other HUD forms in Amharic, Arabic, Armenian, Cambodian, Chinese, Creole, Farsi, French, Hmong, Khmer, Korean, Lao, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Tagalog, and Vietnamese, in addition to English. The site offers brochures on fair housing, model lease agreements, information about HUD's Housing Choice Voucher Program (Section 8), and Resident Rights and Responsibilities. The larger LEP initiative is in response to Executive Order 13166, which requires all federal, local and state agencies that receive federal funding to ensure that people with limited language skills have meaningful access to government programs and services."
12/28/2011:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2011/pr11-292.cfm,FHA Extends Waiver of Anti-Flipping Regulations Through 2012,"WASHINGTON - In an effort to continue stabilizing home values and improve conditions in communities experiencing high foreclosure activity, Acting Federal Housing Administration Commissioner Carol J. Galante today extended a temporary waiver of FHA's anti-flipping regulations through 2012. Read FHA's anti-flipping waiver (www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2011-12-28/pdf/2011-33411.pdf).
""This extension is intended to accelerate the resale of foreclosed properties in neighborhoods struggling to overcome the possible effects of abandonment and blight,"" said Galante. ""FHA remains a critical source of mortgage financing and stability and we must make every effort to promote recovery in every responsible way we can.""
With certain exceptions, FHA rules prohibit insuring a mortgage on a home owned by the seller for less than 90 days. In 2010, however, FHA temporarily waived this regulation through January 31, 2011, and later extended that waiver through the remainder of 2011. The new extension will permit buyers to continue to use FHA-insured financing to purchase HUD-owned properties, bank-owned properties, or properties resold through private sales. It will allow homes to resell as quickly as possible, helping to stabilize real estate prices and to revitalize neighborhoods and communities.
The extension announced today is effective through December 31, 2012, unless otherwise extended or withdrawn by FHA. All other terms of the existing Waiver will remain the same. The Waiver contains strict conditions and guidelines to prevent the predatory practice of property flipping, in which properties are quickly resold at inflated prices to unsuspecting borrowers. The Waiver continues to be limited to sales meeting the following conditions:
All transactions must be arms-length, with no identity of interest between the buyer and seller or other parties participating in the sales transaction; In cases in which the sales price of the property is 20 percent or more above the seller's acquisition cost, the Waiver will apply only if the lender meets specific conditions, and documents the justification for the increase in value; and The Waiver is limited to forward mortgages, and does not apply to the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) for purchase program.
• All transactions must be arms-length, with no identity of interest between the buyer and seller or other parties participating in the sales transaction;
• In cases in which the sales price of the property is 20 percent or more above the seller's acquisition cost, the Waiver will apply only if the lender meets specific conditions, and documents the justification for the increase in value; and
• The Waiver is limited to forward mortgages, and does not apply to the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) for purchase program.
Since the original waiver went into effect on February 1, 2010, FHA has insured nearly 42,000 mortgages worth more than $7 billion on properties resold within 90 days of acquisition.
FHA research finds that in today's market, acquiring, rehabilitating and reselling these properties to prospective homeowners often takes less than 90 days. Prohibiting the use of FHA mortgage insurance for a subsequent resale within 90 days of acquisition adversely impacts the willingness of sellers to allow contracts from potential FHA buyers because they must consider holding costs and the risk of vandalism associated with allowing a property to sit vacant over a 90-day period of time.
