01/08/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-001.cfm,FHA to Reduce Annual Insurance Premiums,"WASHINGTON - As the nation's housing market continues to improve, U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro today announced the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) will reduce the annual premiums new borrowers will pay by half of a percent. This action is projected to save more than two million FHA homeowners an average of $900 annually and spur 250,000 new homebuyers to purchase their first home over the next three years. Read FHA's Mortgagee Letter and a list of frequently asked questions.
Today's action also reflects the improved economic health of FHA's Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMIF). FHA's recent annual report to Congress demonstrates the economic condition of the agency's single-family insurance fund continues to improve, adding $21 billion in value over the past two years.
""This action will make homeownership more affordable for over two million Americans in the next three years,"" said U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro. ""Since 2009, the Obama Administration has taken bold steps to reduce risks in the mortgage market and to protect consumers. These efforts have made it possible to take this prudent measure while also ensuring FHA remains on a positive financial trajectory. By bringing our premiums down, we're helping folks lift themselves up so they can open new doors of opportunity and strengthen their financial futures.""
In the wake of the nation's housing crisis, FHA increased its premium prices to stabilize the health of its MMI Fund. In addition, the Obama Administration took dramatic steps to safeguard consumers in the mortgage market to ensure responsible borrowers continued to have access to mortgage capital as many private lending sources tightened their lending standards.
Today's reduction will significantly expand access to mortgage credit for these families and is expected to lower the cost of housing for the approximately 800,000 households who use FHA annually.
FHA's new annual premium prices are expected to take effect towards the end of the month. FHA will publish a mortgagee letter detailing its new pricing structure shortly."
01/09/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-002.cfm,HUD Charges Brooklyn Co-Op with Discriminating Against Disabled Veteran,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has charged a 1,144-unit Coney Island cooperative development and the president of its board of directors with housing discrimination for refusing to allow a veteran with a psychiatric disability to keep an emotional support animal. HUD is charging Trump Village IV and Igor Oberman, the President of the Trump Village IV Board of Directors, with wrongfully denying the veteran's request for a reasonable accommodation and taking steps to evict him and his wife in retaliation for filing a fair housing complaint. Read HUD's charge.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to refuse to make reasonable accommodations in policies or practices when a person with adisability requires such an accommodation, including refusing to grant waivers to ""no-pet"" policies for persons who use assistance or support animals.
""For many people with disabilities, support animals are essential to their ability to perform everyday activities that others take for granted,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""The Fair Housing Act requires housing providers to grant reasonable accommodations, and HUD is committed to taking action if they fail to meet that obligation.""
The case came to HUD's attention when the veteran and his wife filed a complaint alleging that Trump Village IV and Oberman refused to allow the veteran to keep an emotional support animal and pursued eviction proceedings, despite the fact that he provided medical documentation verifying his condition and need for the dog.
The veteran and his wife also alleged that Trump Village IV retaliated against them for filing their complaint by freezing their place on the wait list for parking in the development's main parking lot and removing the wife from the co-op's board of directors.
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court.

Persons who believe they have been discriminated against because of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status or disability, or denied a reasonable accommodation request may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to www.hud.gov/fairhousing, or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, which can be accessed through Apple devices, such as the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch."
01/16/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-003.cfm,HUD Awards Choice Neighborhood Grants in Six Cities,"WASHINGTON - Building on a commitment to help local communities redevelop distressed public or assisted housing and transform neighborhoods, U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Julián Castro announced seven new Choice Neighborhoods Planning Grant awards. These awards will help grantees craft comprehensive, locally driven plans to revitalize and transform distressed neighborhoods. Part of the Obama Administration's effort to build Ladders of Opportunity to the middle class, HUD's Choice Neighborhoods Initiative promotes a comprehensive approach to transforming neighborhoods struggling to address the interconnected challenges of distressed housing, inadequate schools, poor health, high crime, and lack of capital.
HUD is awarding $3.2 million in Choice Neighborhood Planning grants to the following:
Read local summaries of the grants announced today.
Secretary Castro made the announcement at the Louisville Metro Housing Authority, one of the grantees that will use the funding to improve the Russell neighborhood in Louisville, Kentucky.
""These Choice Neighborhood grants will spark the creation of community plans for progress,"" said Castro. ""We look forward to working with local leaders to breathe new life into struggling neighborhoods, transforming them into places where residents can flourish and dreams can thrive.""
Choice Neighborhoods is HUD's signature place-based initiative and its vision builds on the work that has been done by the Neighborhood Revitalization Initiative, an interagency partnership between HUD, the Department of Education, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice, and Treasury, since 2009. Choice Neighborhoods also supports the Ladders of Opportunity plan, which will help community partners rebuild neighborhoods, expand early learning opportunities, create pathways to jobs, and strengthen families. Choice Neighborhoods is focused on three core goals:
Housing: Replace distressed public and assisted housing with high-quality mixed-income housing that is well-managed and responsive to the needs of the surrounding neighborhood. People: Improve educational outcomes and intergenerational mobility for youth with services and supports delivered directly to youth and their families. Neighborhood: Create the conditions necessary for public and private reinvestment in distressed neighborhoods to offer the kinds of amenities and assets, including safety, good schools, and commercial activity, that are important to families' choices about their community.
• Housing: Replace distressed public and assisted housing with high-quality mixed-income housing that is well-managed and responsive to the needs of the surrounding neighborhood.

New Residential Construction data for January 2015 will be released on Wednesday, February 18, 2015, at 8:30 A.M. EST.
EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take two months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, 4 months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2%) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90-percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised about three percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found on our web site listed above.
* 90% confidence interval includes zero. The Census Bureau does not have sufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero.

01/26/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-006.cfm,HUD Awards $1.8 Billion for Local Homeless Programs,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Julián Castro today awarded $1.8 billion in grants to help nearly 8,400 local homeless housing and service programs across the U.S., Puerto Rico, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands (see attached chart). The Continuum of Care grants announced today support the Administration's efforts to end homelessness by providing critically needed housing and support services to individuals and families experiencing homelessness across the country.
In addition to renewing funding to thousands of effective existing projects, HUD is funding 25 new projects that will provide permanent supportive housing to individuals and families experiencing chronic homelessness in areas with especially high need. These new projects were awarded as part of a special competition designed to help the Department make progress toward its goal of ending chronic homelessness. View a complete list of all the state and local homeless projects awarded funding on HUD's website.
""It's a national shame that anyone would call the streets their home,"" said Castro. ""Working with our local partners, we're redoubling our efforts to support permanent housing solutions for our veterans and those experiencing long-term chronic homelessness. We're also focused on providing targeted assistance to families and young people who are falling between the cracks. As a nation, we can and must end homelessness.""
""Communities across the country are driving progress by implementing the strategies that work to end homelessness—Housing First, permanent supportive housing, and rapid rehousing,"" said Matthew Doherty, Interim Executive Director of the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness. ""The grants announced today are critical investments into these strategies, providing assistance to families and individuals so that they can remain in permanent housing or get back into permanent housing as quickly as possible and never experience the crisis of homelessness again.""
The local programs supported by the grants announced today offer a variety of housing and services including transitional and permanent supportive housing, rapid re-housing, street outreach, client assessment, and other services. HUD is continuing to challenge local communities to reexamine their response to homelessness and give greater weight to proven strategies, including rapid re-housing for homeless families with children, permanent supportive housing for those experiencing chronic homelessness, and implementation of a Housing First approach.
This year marks the 50th anniversary of HUD and Secretary Castro is focused on advancing policies that create opportunity for all Americans. Ending homelessness is among HUD's, and the Obama Administration's, vision. In 2010, President Obama and 19 federal agencies and offices that form the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH) launched the nation's first comprehensive strategy to prevent and end homelessness. Opening Doors: Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness (www.usich.gov/opening_doors/) puts the country on a path to end veterans and chronic homelessness as well as to end homelessness among children, family, and youth.
HUD recently announced the 2014 estimate of the number of homeless persons in America. According to data from more than 3,000 cities and counties around the country, there were 578,424 persons experiencing homelessness on a single night in 2014. Since 2010, local communities around the country reported a10 percent decline in the total number of persons experiencing homelessness and a remarkable 25 percent drop in the number of those living on the streets. In addition, state and local planning agencies' counts reveal a 33 percent drop in homelessness among veterans, including a 43 percent reduction in unsheltered homelessness among veterans.
cross America, local homelessness planning agencies called 'Continuums of Care' are organizing volunteers at this time of year to help count the number of persons located in emergency shelters, transitional housing programs and living unsheltered on the streets. Continuums of Care will report these one-night 'point-in-time counts' later in the year and will form the basis of HUD's 2015 national homeless estimate."

01/29/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-010.cfm,FHA Announces Reverse Mortgage Foreclosure Alternative,"WASHINGTON - The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) today issued a new policy under its Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) Program giving FHA-approved lenders the option to delay calling HECMs with eligible 'non-borrowing spouses' due and payable. A delay would postpone foreclosure normally triggered by the death of the last surviving borrower. FHA's new guidance will allow reverse mortgage lenders to assign eligible HECMs to HUD upon the death of the last surviving borrowing spouse, thereby allowing eligible surviving spouses the opportunity to remain in the home despite their non-borrowing status.
Last year, FHA amended its HECM policies to allow for the deferral of foreclosure, or 'due and payable status' for certain Eligible Non-Borrowing Spouses for case numbers assigned on or after August 4, 2014. Today's action allows lenders to offer similar treatment for eligible HECMs and Eligible Non-Borrowing Spouses with FHA case numbers issued before August 4, 2014.
Under FHA's new policy, lenders will be allowed to pursue claim payments for HECMs with Eligible Surviving Non-Borrowing Spouses and Case Numbers assigned before August 4, 2014 by:
Allowing claim payment following sale of the property by heirs or estate; Foreclosing in accordance with the terms of the mortgage, and filing an insurance claim under the FHA insurance contract as endorsed; or Electing to assign the HECM to HUD upon the death of the last surviving borrower, where the HECM would not otherwise be assignable to FHA. (The MOE Assignment)

01/29/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-011.cfm,Administration and California Partner to Drive Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency in Multifamily Housing,"WASHINGTON - The Obama Administration is committed to taking responsible steps to address climate change, promote clean energy, and help ensure a cleaner, more stable environment for future generations. That is why, today, Secretary Castro, of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and Governor Brown of California are announcing a number of actions to expand financing for energy efficiency and solar energy in multifamily housing. Today's actions also set us on a track to reach the President's goal of installing 100 megawatts of renewable energy across federally subsidized housing by 2020.
In the United States, about a quarter of households live in multifamily housing units, including more than 3 million units in California alone. Improving the energy efficiency of these buildings nationwide by 20 percent would save nearly $7 billion in energy costs each year and cut 350 million tons of carbon pollution in a decade. Across the country, affordable housing leaders and service providers are also stepping up to deploy solar energy on affordable multifamily properties because solar makes economic sense for them, brings a boost to struggling communities and families, and is a solution that is ready now. To continue to reinforce American leadership in deploying clean energy and cutting energy waste while creating jobs and reducing carbon pollution, the Administration and California are partnering to announce the following actions:
Unlocking Property-Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) Financing for Multifamily Housing in California: PACE is an innovative mechanism for financing energy efficiency and renewable energy improvements. Commercial PACE programs have the potential to provide a robust source of capital to accelerate renewable energy and efficiency retrofits for energy and water in multifamily housing, making the existing multifamily stock more affordable to renters with low incomes and saving money for consumers and taxpayers. To remove existing barriers and accelerate the use of PACE financing for multifamily housing, today:
Governor Brown is establishing a California Multifamily PACE Pilot in partnership with the MacArthur Foundation. The Pilot will enable PACE financing for certain multifamily properties, including specific properties within HUD, the California Department of Housing and Community Development, and the California Housing Finance Agency's portfolios, opening up financing to an entire segment of commercial PACE projects. Secretary Castro is issuing guidance clarifying the circumstances under which HUD can approve PACE financing on HUD-assisted and-insured housing in California. The U.S. Department of Energy is committing to work with the State of California to design and undertake a study assessing the performance of California's PACE program as data becomes available.

Driving On-Bill Repayment in Affordable Multifamily Properties in California: HUD is committing to support the State of California in creating an innovative California Master-Metered Multifamily Finance Pilot Project. The Pilot will enhance affordable multifamily properties', which have a substantial majority of a property's energy consumption billed through a common meter, access to upfront capital for financing energy efficiency improvements, on affordable terms and time frames, and which are repaid through the master meter utility bill. The $3 million program of technical assistance and credit support may include a loan loss reserve and/or a debt-service reserve fund. The pilot is intended to inform project performance and repayment experience while managing finance risk perception.
Engaging Philanthropy and the Financial Sector to Support Renewable Energy in Affordable Housing: To set us down this path, today, we are announcing:
The White House and HUD will host a roundtable on February 19 with leaders from the finance and philanthropic communities to discuss opportunities to enhance solar financing for affordable housing. Building on $200 million invested on multifamily preservation projects, the MacArthur Foundation is committing to make at least $10 million in impact investments to create and expand the California PACE and On-Bill Pilots, and explore other innovations, including the use of Pay for Success.

Empowering Communities to Deploy Solar: Today, the Department of Energy is awarding more than $14 million for 15 projects that will develop plans, streamline deployment and launch innovative programs to spur solar market growth in numerous communities across the U.S. The projects take a variety of approaches to develop actionable strategic plans to promote deployment at residential, community and commercial scales—from using local financing mechanisms, such as commercial PACE type projects to integrating solar energy generation into communities' emergency response plans. Ultimately, the case studies and lessons learned from these projects will provide similar communities with examples that can be replicated—an important step towards making solar deployment faster, easier, and cheaper across the country. The awardees include not-for-profits, utilities, industry associations, universities, and state and local jurisdictions in California, Illinois, Minnesota, New York, Utah, Virginia, Vermont, Wisconsin, and Washington, D.C.
Announcing New Commitments to Advance Energy Efficiency Investments in Multifamily Housing: In February 2011, President Obama launched the Better Buildings Challenge to help American commercial, industrial, and multifamily buildings become at least 20 percent more energy efficient by 2020. More than 250 diverse organizations, representing over 3 billion square feet, 600 manufacturing plants, and more than $2 billion in energy efficiency financing have stepped up to the President's Challenge, including more than 85 new multifamily partners since the Challenge was expanded to multifamily housing. Since the Better Building Challenge began, partners are on track to meet the 2020 goal and on average, are cutting energy use by 2.5 percent each year, saving 36 trillion BTUs and $300 million. Today, responding to the President's call to action on energy efficiency 6 new multifamily housing authorities and owners are announcing that they are joining the President's Better Buildings Challenge, committing to improving the energy efficiency of more than 5.5 million square feet of additional floor space, an area the size of more than 115 football fields, by at least 20 percent in the next decade:
> AHEAD, Inc., Littleton, NH
> Gragg Cardona Partners, Washington, DC
> Housing Authority of the Birmingham District, Birmingham, AL
> Newark Housing Authority, Newark, NJ
> The DeBruler Co., Libertyville, IL
> Windsor Locks Housing Authority, Windsor Locks, CT.
The Administration is also calling on Section 202 Project Rental Assistance Contract (PRAC) properties serving elderly and disabled Californians to take advantage of the PRAC Shared Savings incentive HUD released in September 2014. The incentive allows owners to utilize realized utility bill savings to make needed energy and water improvements at their property as part of the Better Buildings Challenge.
Making Energy Data More Accessible For Multifamily Housing Owners: Better information helps building owners and residents understand when there are opportunities to reduce energy consumption, which saves money for tenants, owners and taxpayers. HUD spends approximately $6.4 billion annually on utility costs for affordable housing properties and households, so improving access to utility data for owners and tenants is a high priority. As part of HUD's work on data access, HUD will be publishing guidance that standardizes the approach owners and performance based contract administrators use to appropriately assess the utility subsidy levels needed to offset tenant paid utilities. In November, Secretary Castro issued a call to utilities to work with HUD as well as regulators, property owners, and other stakeholders across the country to facilitate better processes for building owners to access utility usage and expense information for their properties. Today, California is responding to Secretary Castro's call by announcing it will obtain and ensure owner access to energy usage data, with appropriate privacy protections, for multi-family buildings and set data standardization and benchmarking efforts to ensure the data that is collected in a way that is accessible and can be used to track progress towards achieving their energy and climate goals.
TODAY'S ANNOUNCEMENTS BUILD ON PROGRESS TO DEPLOY RENEWABLE ENERGY AND PROMOTE ENERGY EFFICIENCY
In the State of the Union, the President stated that last year, we installed as much solar every three weeks as we did in all of 2008. In 2013 alone, the price of commercial and residential solar declined by more than 12 percent. This is driving more and more Americans to install solar panels at their homes and businesses, and is supporting tens of thousands of solar jobs across the country. We are also making progress cutting energy waste. Since 2009, the U.S. Department of Energy has already put in place appliance efficiency standards that will save American consumers nearly $480 billion on their utility bills through 2030.
In January, Governor Brown set an ambitious goal for California to generate 50 percent of its electricity from renewable energy by 2050. The actions announced today are consistent with that goal and build on a solid commitment to deploy renewable energy and promote energy efficiency statewide. In July 2014, Governor Brown allocated $75 million cap-and-trade proceeds for weatherization and renewable energy. A proportion of these funds will assist in the installation of energy efficiency and renewable energy projects in low income housing units within disadvantaged communities."
01/30/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-008.cfm,HUD Issues Rule to Guide Housing Trust Fund Implementation,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) published an interim program rule (FR-5246-I-03) rule to the Federal Register today (https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2015/01/30/2015-01642/housing-trust-fund) providing guidance to state and local entities for the implementation of the National Housing Trust Fund (HTF). The HTF is a new affordable housing production program that will complement existing Federal, state and local efforts to increase and preserve the supply of decent, safe, and clean affordable housing for extremely low- and very low-income households, including homeless families.
In December 2014, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) directed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to begin setting aside and allocating funds to the Housing Trust Fund pursuant to the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA).
""Affordable housing is about opportunity. Today's action is the latest step toward important progress for the American people,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""Once fully implemented, the Housing Trust Fund will help folks across the nation secure a decent place to call home. We look forward to working closely with our partners across the nation to implement this critical resource to expand the circle of opportunity for current and future generations of Americans.""
States and state-designated entities are eligible grantees for the HTF. Annual formula grants will be made, of which at least 80 percent must be used for rental housing; up to 10 percent for homeownership; and up to 10 percent for the grantee's reasonable administrative and planning costs.
During 2015, States will begin developing their HTF Allocation Plans and solicit input from their constituents and submit these plans to HUD along with their 2016 Annual Acton Plans. HUD anticipates that grantees will receive their HTF allocations by summer 2016.
HTF funds may be used for the production or preservation of affordable housing through the acquisition, new construction, reconstruction, and/or rehabilitation of non-luxury housing with suitable amenities. All HTF-assisted units will be required to have a minimum affordability period of 30 years.

01/30/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-009.cfm,HUD-VA Program that Serves Homeless Veterans to Expand into Native American Communities for the First Time,"WASHINGTON - Today the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced that the HUD and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) program that helps homeless veterans find permanent supportive housing will, for the first time, expand directly into Native American communities. This support for veterans is provided through the HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) Program which combines rental assistance from HUD with case management and clinical services provided by VA.
The HUD-VASH program will now be opened to tribes so they may directly serve Native American veterans living on or near tribal lands. To expand the HUD-VASH program, $4 million will be invested specifically to support Native American veterans experiencing homelessness by providing them with secure housing and connecting them with clinical services and case management. This groundbreaking new effort will expand opportunity for approximately 650 veterans who are currently homeless or at risk of homelessness.
""Ensuring that our men and women who served in uniform receive the care and support they've earned is a national responsibility,"" said HUD SecretaryJulián Castro. ""But for too long, fulfilling that responsibility to many Native American veterans has been borne by Indian Country alone. We're changing that this year.""
Expanding the HUD-VASH program will inform and improve how HUD serves Native American veterans, as well as further the goals of ending homelessness in tribal communities more broadly. While there is a need for the program in Indian Country, HUD is calling on both national and regional Native American leaders, associations and communities to offer insight into the design of the expansion, including ways that tribes estimate homelessness, what criteria HUD should establish in allocating funding, what medical providers are offering care to veterans, and how HUD can target program assistance in ways that encourage the creation of new housing.
To expedite the program expansion, HUD has requested tribal responses through its Office of Native American Programs within 30 days rather than the traditional 60 day comment period. Comments can be submitted by February 25 to tribalhudvashcomments@hud.gov.
In addition, six of HUD's Regional Field Offices will host public listening sessions with Native American communities in their areas. Those who can attend sessions are encouraged to do so.
As HUD celebrates its 50th anniversary this year, Secretary Castro is focused on advancing policies that create opportunities for all Americans, including the broader Administration goal of ending homelessness among veterans. HUD-VASH is an important part of that effort to provide critical housing and services to veterans experiencing homelessness that also includes HUD's Continuum of Care program, VA's Supportive Services for Veteran Families (SSVF), and the Mayors Challenge to End Veteran Homelessness.
Since the release of Opening Doors, the nation's first ever Federal strategicplan to prevent and end homelessness (www.usich.gov/PDF/FactSheetVeterans.pdf), all forms of homelessness have declined significantly, particularly among veterans.In November 2014, HUD, VA and the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH) released a national estimate of veteran homelessness in the United States which showed a decline of 33 percent (or 24,837 people) since 2010. This includes a nearly 40 percent drop in the number of unsheltered veterans sleeping on the street.
Since 2008, HUD and VA have awarded almost 70,000 HUD-VASH vouchers and served more than 82,000 veterans experiencing homelessness. Rental assistance and support services provided through HUD-VASH are a critical resource for local communities in ending homelessness among veterans.
In the traditional HUD-VASH program, VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) assess veterans experiencing homelessness before referring them to local housing agencies for these vouchers. Decisions are traditionally based on a variety of factors, most importantly the duration of homelessness and the need for longer term, more intensive support in obtaining and maintaining permanent housing. The HUD-VASH program includes both the rental assistance the voucher provides and the comprehensive case management that VAMC staff offers.
Veterans participating in the traditional HUD-VASH program rent privately owned housing and generally contribute no more than 30 percent of their income toward rent. VA offers eligible veterans experiencing homelessness with clinical and supportive services through its medical centers across the U.S., Guam and Puerto Rico."

""The President's FY 2016 Budget proposal is a blueprint for greater opportunity for all Americans. By increasing funding for Native American communities, the President's Budget would give more families a fair chance to get ahead. HUD is deeply committed to working with our partners to shape a future where every person has the opportunity to pursue the American Dream.""
HUD's 2016 budget seeks an additional $10 million for the Department's Indian Housing Block Grant (IHGB) Program, which is a major source of affordable housing assistance to more than 550 tribal governments in 34 states. In addition, the budget proposes to create a new set-aside within theIndian Community Development Block Grant of up to $10 million to be used to help tribes attract and retain high-quality teachers in Indian Country by improving the availability and physical condition of teacher housing.
The proposed FY 2016 budget includes:
$660 million through HUD's Indian Housing Block Grant (IHBG) Program, an increase of $10 million over the FY15 enacted budget, to help tribal grantees to invest in new homes, infrastructure and economic development.

Jobs-Plus provides intensive, employment-focused programs targeting every able-bodied, working-age welfare recipient at a public housing development.
In addition, HUD's spending plan seeks $177.5 million for rental voucher for families, veterans, and Native Americans experiencing homelessness, as well as victims of domestic and dating violence, who are not currently living in assisted housing. These ""special purpose vouchers"" are specifically developed to serve Native Americans facing homelessness and overcrowding, and may be used for newly constructed and acquired housing.
Last week, HUD and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) announced that, for the first time ever, a program to help homeless veterans find permanent supportive housing will be expanded into Native American communities.

Helping Families Secure Quality Housing
HUD's 2016 Budget maintains a core commitment to provide opportunity for families receiving rental assistance and those households seeking homeownership. This includes funding all existing rental assistance vouchers serving 2.4 million low-income households and to restore 67,000 vouchers lost in 2013 due to sequestration, including:
37,000 new tenant-based Housing Choice Vouchers; 23,000 new homeless vouchers for families, veterans and Native Americans; 4,900 new vouchers for victims of domestic and dating violence protection vouchers; and 2,600 new family unification vouchers.

• $60 million under HUD's Housing Counseling Program, an increase of $13 million (28 percent)
from current funding levels to help nearly two million consumers to improve or restore their borrowing ability, access credit, and improve their housing quality and affordability.
Federal Housing Administration
To further expand access to affordable mortgage financing to credit-qualified households, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) reduced annual mortgage insurance premiums for new borrowers by .50 percent. This action is projected to save more than two million FHA homeowners an average of $900 annually and spur 250,000 new homebuyers to purchase their first home over the next three years. Due to aggressive and necessary action over the last six years, FHA's value has improved $21 billion in the last two years and remains on a very strong trajectory.
Native American Housing and Community Development
The 2016 Budget requests $748 million to address housing needs in Native American communities, including funding teacher housing to attract educators to Indian Country, as well as connecting Native American veterans to homes and vital clinical services. HUD's Budget for tribal communities includes:
$660 million under the Indian Housing Block Grant (IHBG) Program, an increase of $10 million from the FY15 enacted budget, to promote affordable housing, infrastructure and economic development; $80 million through the Indian Community Development Block Grant (ICDBG) Program, a $14 million increase current levels, to assist federally recognized Indian tribes, Alaska Native villages, and tribal organizations for a wide variety of development needs; and $8 million for the Indian Housing Loan Guarantee program (Section 184) Program, a $1 million increase over 2015, to tribal communities to access private capital as a means of stimulating their affordable housing and homeownership programs.

Ending Homelessness
To achieve the goals of Opening Doors, the Federal Government's first-ever strategy to prevent and end homelessness, the 2016 Budget invests in proven approaches such as Housing First. The spending proposal includes $2.5 billion for the Continuum of Care and Emergency Solutions Grant Programs. This represents an increase of $345 million above current funding levels and an additional 25,500 new permanent supportive housing units for persons experiencing long-term or chronic homelessness. HUD is also seeking funding to prevent homelessness for 15,000 families with children and $332 million for housing assistance to low-income persons living with HIV/AIDS and their families.
Strengthening All Communities in this Century of Cities
To empower local communities, the 2016 Budget would expand opportunity in high poverty areas by investing $250 million to transform neighborhoods through the Choice Neighborhoods Program. HUD is also proposing to expand the authority it offers to select Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) through Moving to Work. This program allows these PHAs greater flexibility to make local decisions about how to operate their housing programs and test innovative ways to improve self-sufficiency, mobility, academic performance and other outcomes for HUD-assisted tenants.
HUD is proposing to eliminate the current cap under its Rental Assistance Demonstration Program (RAD) and provide $50 million to help local public housing agencies to finance the recapitalization of more than 180,000 units of public housing and stimulate private investment.
The Budget includes a request of $100 million for Jobs-Plus, a $85 million increase from FY 2015, and would allow Tribally Designated Housing Entities to administer a Jobs-Plus Program. Jobs-Plus provides intensive, employment-focused programs targeting every able-bodied, working-age welfare recipient at a public housing development. To further encourage self-sufficiency among HUD-assisted households, the Budget seeks $85 million for the Family Self-Sufficiency Program to fund approximately 1,600 Family Self-Sufficiency Program Coordinators who will serve approximately 80,000 families to boost savings, earnings, and employment rates among program participants.

02/03/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-014.cfm,"HUD Reports Continued High Levels of ""Worst Case Housing Needs""","WASHINGTON - The number of very poor families struggling to pay their monthly rent and who may also be living in substandard housing declined between 2011 and 2013, but persist at high levels according to a new summary report released today by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). HUD reports that in 2013, 7.7 million very low-income unassisted families paid more than half their monthly income for rent, lived in severely substandard housing, or both.
HUD's Worst Case Housing Needs: 2015 Report to Congress (www.huduser.org/portal/publications/affhsg/wc_HsgNeeds15.html) is part of a long-term series of reports measuring the scale of critical housing problems facing very low-income un-assisted renters. Based on data from HUD's most recent American Housing Survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau, the number of these ""Worst Case Housing Needs"" declined from the previous record high in 2011 (8.5 million households) yet remain nearly 50 percent higher than in 2003. HUD will issue a final report on these worst case needs this spring.
""This report demonstrates the profound difficulties felt by millions of households struggling to pay their rent,"" said Castro. ""As our economy continues to improve, we need to ensure our budget provides opportunity for vulnerable families living on the margins and restores the harmful cuts to our rental assistance programs due to sequestration.""
Worst Case Housing Needs are defined as renters with very low incomes (below half the median in their area) who do not receive government housing assistance and who either paid more than half their monthly incomes for rent, lived in severely substandard conditions, or both. HUD's report finds that housing needs cut across all regions of the country and included all racial and ethnic groups, regardless of whether they lived in cities, suburbs or rural areas. In addition, HUD concluded that large numbers of worst case needs were also found across various household types including families with children, senior citizens, and persons with disabilities.
HUD's report found:
Worst case housing needs were 7.7 million in 2013, down from a historic high of 8.5 million in 2011. This represents a 9 percent decline since 2011 yet remains 9 percent greater than in 2009 and 49 percent greater than in 2003.

Worst case needs affect very low-income renters across racial and ethnic groups. The prevalence of worst case needs among such renters during 2013 was 44 percent for non-Hispanic Whites and Hispanics, 35 percent for non-Hispanic Blacks, and 42 percent for others. The rate decreased between 2011 and 2013 for non-Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic Blacks, and Hispanics but not for others.

The rate decreased between 2011 and 2013 for non-Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic Blacks, and Hispanics but not for others.

Worst case needs also affect all types of households. In 2013, 2.8 million families with children, 1.5 million elderly households without children, 2.7 million other ""nonfamily"" households (unrelated people sharing housing), and 0.7 million ""other family"" households experienced worst case needs.

The vast majority (97 percent) of Worst Case Housing Needs are caused by severe rent burden—paying more than half of income for rent. Inadequate housing caused only three percent of worst case needs.

Government housing assistance programs, including those provided by HUD, significantly reduce worst case needs and homelessness but are not available for all those who need assistance. Nationwide, approximately one-in-four very low-income households receive some form of rental assistance. The Obama Administration has been taking strong action to respond to the decline in family incomes and increase in need for affordable housing:
Through a variety of rental assistance programs, HUD helps approximately 4.7 million families to find suitable affordable housing. The Department's FY 2016 Budget seeks to renew tenant-based rental assistance to 2.4 million current voucher holders and restore approximately 67,000 vouchers lost in 2013 due to sequestration.

02/06/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-015.cfm,"HUD 2016 Budget Proposes Increased Support to 'Colonias' in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California","WASHINGTON - As part of President Obama's Fiscal Year 2016 Budget, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is proposing to increase the amount that states along the U.S.-Mexico border can use to promote affordable housing and community development in severely distressed communities known as Colonias. The budget would authorize the states of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California to set aside up to 15 percent (from the current 10 percent) of their Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funding for these rural border communities that often lack adequate water, sewer, and/or decent housing.
""This change addresses the urgent need to transform our communities along the border,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""HUD is firmly committed to working with states and colonia residents to leverage resources for infrastructure - from housing to clean running water, community development, jobs and training. We're going to ensure that every family in America has a chance to move ahead and share in the promise of America.""
In accordance with the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act (NAHA) of 1990, HUD defines a colonia as a community within 150 miles of the United States-Mexico border in Arizona, California, New Mexico and Texas that was in existence before November 28, 1990, excluding metropolitan areas with populations exceeding one million. In addition, a colonia must include a ""lack of potable water supply, lack of adequate sewage systems, and lack of decent, safe, and sanitary housing."" Some colonias are incorporated communities under the control of the city, some are unincorporated under control of the county, and others may be territories of cities which share some level of control with the county.
Although colonia set-aside funds may be used for any CDBG-eligible activities, basic infrastructure (water and wastewater treatment systems) and housing activities should have priority. States should only fund other activities if they are done in conjunction with basic infrastructure or housing activities.
""Colonia funding is critical to addressing the long term infrastructure and housing needs of these very low-income communities,"" Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller said. ""Providing potable water and sanitary sewer is essential to the health of the entire community. Safe housing is absolutely necessary for residents to develop and thrive as productive citizens.""
Texas has the most colonias, with over 2,000 individual communities considered eligible. The state has also developed innovative programs and services beyond the basic activities that are eligible under the state CDBG program, including Self-Help Centers administered by local non-profits that provide home construction and repair technical assistance, tools for borrowing, and financial literacy training and technology access to colonia residents. In FY 2014, Texas set aside the maximum allowable of 10 percent of its CDBG funds for colonias, which was a total of $6,149,458, plus an additional $1,537,364 for Colonia Self-Help Centers.
In New Mexico, about 150 colonias have been identified. Most are unincorporated long-standing communities. Many of the New Mexico colonias consist of rural small towns that were designated as colonias via county resolutions that cited a lack of adequate water, sewer, and/or safe and sanitary housing. In FY 2014, New Mexico set aside the maximum allowable of 10 percent of its CDBG funds for colonias, which was a total of $901,637.
In Arizona, significant improvements have been made to the way it administers the CDBG colonias set-aside funding. The state had relied upon county resolutions that served as designations of certain communities as colonias due to lack of potable water, adequate sewer and/or decent, safe and sanitary housing. Consequently, many of the colonias were designated at the town level. Following an audit by HUD's Office of the Inspector General in 2008, Arizona began a colonias survey to better define the colonias' boundaries and measure their needs. In FY 2014, Arizona set aside the maximum allowable of 10 percent of its CDBG funds for colonias, which was a total of $914,695.
California is unique among the four border states. It has the shortest section of the US-Mexico border. Much of the border area does not qualify as the 'US-Mexico Border Region' that excludes the metropolitan areas of Los Angeles, San Diego and Riverside due to their populations. Therefore the number of communities that qualify as colonias is 15. In FY 2014, California set aside 5 percent of its CDBG funds for colonias, which was a total of $1,476,486.
In addition to the CDBG set-aside funds, HUD's Border Community Capital Initiative (""Border Initiative"") is a partnership among three Federal agencies - HUD, the Department of the Treasury's Community Development Financial Institutions Fund (CDFI Fund) and the Department of Agriculture - Rural Development (USDA-RD) to increase access to capital for affordable housing, business lending and community facilities in the chronically underserved and undercapitalized U.S./Mexico border region. Grant funding of $2 million announced last year is part of the White House Rural Council (www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/rural-council). The Council was launched by President Obama in 2012 to help create jobs and expand opportunities in rural communities."

The funding will allow agencies to make major large-scale improvements to their public housing units. View funding by public housing authority here.
Today's grants are provided through HUD's Capital Fund Program, which offers annual funding to approximately 3,100 public housing authorities (PHA) to build, repair, renovate and/or modernize the public housing in their communities. These housing authorities use the funding to do large-scale improvements such as replacing roofs or making energy-efficient upgrades to replace old plumbing and electrical systems.
""Every American deserves a place to call home where they can successfully raise their kids, enhance their financial security and build a better life,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""Through this funding, HUD is committed to strengthening our nation's affordable housing units and to providing folks with the springboard they need to succeed.""
For more than 75 years, the federal government has been working and investing billions of dollars in developing and maintaining public and multifamily housing - including providing critical support through the Capital Fund grants announced today. Still, the nation continues to lose approximately 10,000 public housing units each year, primarily due to disrepair. In 2011, HUD released Capital Needs in the Public Housing Program, a study that estimated the capital needs in the public housing stock in the U.S. The study found the nation's 1.1 million public housing units are facing an estimated $25.6 billion in large-scale repairs. Unlike routine maintenance, capital needs are extensive improvements required to make the housing decent and economically sustainable, such as replacing roofs or updating plumbing and electrical systems to increase energy efficiency.
To help protect the considerable federal investment in public housing, and respond to the growing demand for affordable rental housing, the Obama Administration proposed the Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD), a comprehensive strategy that complements the Capital Fund Program and offers a long-term solution to preserve and enhance the country's affordable housing stock, including leveraging public and private funding to make critically needed improvements.
Since Congress approved the RAD demonstration in November of 2011, early results show it is generating significant additional capital for public and assisted housing. HUD has made awards to 60,000 public and assisted housing units in more than 340 different projects across the country. Through these awards, housing authorities have proposed to generate approximately $3 billion in capital repairs by leveraging private debt and equity, which will preserve or replace distressed units and support local jobs in their communities - all without additional federal resources.
Currently, the Department has received applications from PHAs for an additional 116,000 units under RAD. To support the growing demand for RAD, the President's FY 2016 budget proposal requests to eliminate the RAD cap, and provide $50 million to help local public housing agencies to finance the recapitalization of more than 185,000 units of public housing and stimulate private investment.

02/18/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-018.cfm,HUD Announces More Than $650 Million in Indian Housing Block Grants,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today announced more than $651 million to 586 Native American tribes in 34 states (see list below). Indian Housing Block Grant (IHBG) allocations are distributed each year to eligible Indian tribes or their tribally designated housing entities for a range of affordable housing activities.
IHBG funds primarily benefit low-income families living on Indian reservations or in other American Indian and Alaska Native communities. The amount of each grant is based on a formula that considers local needs and housing units under management by the tribe or designated entity.
""Our nation is at its best when everyone has a fair chance to thrive,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""These funds will support the innovative work Native American tribes and families are doing to build a more prosperous future. Our partnership with these local leaders today will create better housing opportunities, more robust economic development and stronger communities tomorrow.""
Eligible activities for the funds include housing development, assistance to housing developed under the Indian Housing Program of the 1937 Housing Act, housing services to eligible families and individuals, housing management services, crime prevention and safety, and model activities that provide creative approaches to solving affordable housing problems. The block grant approach to housing was enabled by the Native American Housing Assistance and Self Determination Act of 1996 (NAHASDA).
HUD's proposed Fiscal Year 2016 Budget seeks $748 million to address critical housing and community development needs in Native American communities, including $660 million for IHBG allocations."

EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take two months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, 4 months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2%) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90-percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised about three percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found on our web site listed above.
* 90% confidence interval includes zero. The Census Bureau does not have sufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero.

SC2 has also received a ""Bright Idea"" designation, joining the Ash Center's Government Innovator's Network.
The Innovations in American Government Award Program is the nation's preeminent program devoted to recognizing and promoting excellence and creativity in the public sector. The award highlights exemplary models of government innovation and advances efforts to address the nation's most pressing public concerns. Since its inception in 1985, the Program has received over 27,000 applications and recognized nearly 500 government initiatives.
""We're living in a Century of Cities, a time when people around the world—including here in the United States—are urbanizing at a breathtaking pace,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""The SC2 initiative is empowering local leaders with new tools to maximize federal investments, spark economic activity and expand opportunity for their residents. I congratulate the SC2 team, and all of its partners, for being selected as a finalist. I'm confident that this effort will continue to help build cities poised for future success.""
The Obama Administration launched the Strong Cities, Strong Communities (SC2) Initiative in 2011 as a unique partnership between the federal government and mayors of chronically distressed cities that have faced significant long-term challenges in developing and implementing their economic strategies. SC2 was designed to be a flexible program that strengthens local capacity, coordinates federal investments, and sparks economic revitalization through private and philanthropic partnerships.
The SC2 Initiative was developed through engagement with mayors, Members of Congress, foundations, nonprofits and other community partners who are committed to addressing the challenges facing local governments as they work to create economic opportunity for all residents.
""We are proud that the SC2 Initiative has received this prestigious recognition,"" said Mark Linton, Executive Director of the White House Council on Strong Cities, Strong Communities. ""At a time when communities must innovate across the private and public sectors to spark economic growth and attract investment, this designation affirms the value that local leaders and residents find when the federal government can collaborate in new ways to support local priorities and leverage expertise and resources.""
SC2 has supported 14 cities by embedding Federal inter-agency expert teams to work alongside city leadership, community organizations, local businesses and philanthropic foundations to support the cities' visions for economic growth and development. The primary goal is to help these cities more effectively invest existing resources, provide advice and expertise in support of local priorities, better align federal programs and investments, and facilitate new private and public partnerships and peer learning opportunities wherever possible.
A key component of the SC2 Initiative is the National Resource Network (The Network), which seeks to emulate the SC2 model and implement it in municipalities throughout the nation. The Network is a first of its kind effort to bring together national experts under one organization to work with cities seeking to increase their economic competitiveness and to reverse population decline, job loss and high rates of poverty.
The Network is led by a consortium selected by the federal government because of its members' expertise and experience as national leaders in assisting cities in efforts to overcome challenges related to economic development, community development and fiscal and operational issues. The Network also includes more than a dozen strategic partners with experience and expertise in criminal justice, education, workforce development and other policy areas.
""With the support of the federal government, the Network will be able to expand the SC2 Initiative to dozens of other cities working to overcome economic challenges and increase their economic competitiveness,"" said David Eichenthal, Executive Director of the National Resource Network. ""By bringing together the federal government, the for-profit and non-profit sectors and academic experts, the Network is a truly innovative effort to develop new solutions for cities.""

02/22/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-022.cfm,"HUD and City of Berlin, New Hampshire, Settle Allegations of Housing Discrimination Against Victims of Domestic Violence","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has reached a Conciliation Agreement with the city of Berlin, New Hampshire. The agreement settles allegations that the municipality violated the Fair Housing Act when it enacted an ordinance requiring landlords to evict tenants cited three or more times for ""disorderly action,"" including domestic violence incidents.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to evict an individual because of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, disability, or familial status.
""When landlords evict victims of domestic violence, they victimize those individuals a second time,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD is committed to educating cities about their obligation to uphold laws that protect fair housing rights.""
The agreement is the result of a complaint initiated under the authority of HUD Secretary Julián Castro alleging that the city of Berlin discriminated against women when it enacted an ordinance requiring landlords to evict tenants cited by police three or more times for ""disorderly action"" or risk being fined and/or losing their rental license. The ordinance made no exception for victims of domestic violence, which are overwhelmingly women and who needed police assistance.
Under the terms of the Conciliation Agreement, Berlin will amend its ordinance to include language stating that the ""…ordinance is not intended to be used against victims of reported incidents of domestic violence."" The city will also modify its definition of ""disorderly action"" to state that ""disorderly action"" will not include the actions of victims of reported domestic violence incidents.
In addition, the city will post the Conciliation Agreement on its web site, host and publicize an activity to raise awareness of domestic violence, and provide fair housing training to the mayor, councilmembers, city manager, chief of police, and all other city employees who interact with victims of crime or abuse.
Federally funded housing providers also must comply with the Violence Against Women Act and HUD regulations that provide protection for victims of domestic violence.
Persons who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed at www.hud.gov/fairhousing or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, which can be accessed through Apple devices, such as the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch."
02/23/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-023.cfm,HUD Issues Guidance on Home Lending and Appropriate Placement for Transgender Persons in Homeless Shelters,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) issued guidance to better serve LGBT Americans seeking to obtain a home loan and transgender individuals seeking access to homeless shelters. These two sets of guidance will help clarify the Equal Access to Housing in HUD Programs Regardless of Sexual Orientation or Gender Identity Rule (Equal Access Rule), which was published in 2012. The Equal Access Rule ensures that housing across HUD programs is open to all eligible individuals regardless of actual or perceived sexual orientation, gender identity or marital status.
HUD's guidance on program eligibility for HUD assisted and insured housing programs includes an equal access provision making clear that housing that is financed or insured by HUD must be made available without regard to actual or perceived sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital status. It also prohibits owners and operators of HUD-funded housing, or housing whose financing was insured by HUD, from inquiring about an applicant's sexual orientation or gender identity or denying housing on that basis. In addition, the guidance also makes clear that sexual orientation and gender identity should not and cannot be part of any lending decision when it comes to getting an FHA-insured mortgage.
""It's an injustice that any transgender person is mistreated when seeking help,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""We issued this guidance so that shelter providers treat these Americans with the dignity they deserve. This measure is an important step in shaping a future where every person is accepted, respected and housed.""
HUD also issued guidance on how to best serve transgender persons in single-sex shelter facilities (https://www.hudexchange.info/resource/4428/notice-cpd-15-02-appropriate-placement-for-transgender-persons-in-single-sex-emergency-shelters-and-other-facilities). The guidance will help address the fact that almost 40 percent of homeless youth are LGBT, and the majority of them report harassment, difficulty, or even sexual assault when trying to access homeless shelters. This guidance states that a transgender client's or potential client's own views with respect to personal health and safety deserve serious consideration when placing the person in a single sex shelter. Not only does the guidance address appropriate placement of transgenderindividuals in single sex facilities, but it also guides providers on how best to address privacy and safety concerns within the facilities in ways that do not segregate or isolate transgender individuals.
The creation and implementation of the Equal Access Rule builds on HUD's and President Obama's commitment to expanding opportunity, advancing equality, and leveling the playing field for LGBT individuals and families. Since 2010, HUD has taken steps to strengthen LGBT protections, such as adopting the principle that gender identity discrimination is sex discrimination under the Fair Housing Act, adopting the requirement that applicants for competitive HUD funds must be in compliance with state and local LGBT nondiscrimination laws, releasing a groundbreaking study on LGBT housing discrimination, and pursuing complaints under the Equal Access Rule."

The funding will also link the elderly and people with disabilities with supportive services that allow them to maintain independent living and age-in-place. See list of funding by states below.
The funding, provided through HUD's Resident Opportunities and Self Sufficiency - Service Coordinators Program (ROSS-SC) helps public housing authorities, resident associations, non-profit organizations, Indian tribes or entities representing Indian tribes hire or retain ""service coordinators"" who work directly with residents to assess their needs and connect them with education, job training and placement programs, and/or computer and financial literacy services available in their community to promote self-sufficiency. For an elderly or disabled resident, the service coordinator arranges supportive services that allow them to maintain their independence.
""Housing should be a springboard to success,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""This funding will help our local partners provide families with the educational and economic opportunities they need to build a more prosperous future for themselves and their children.""
The purpose of HUD's ROSS-SC program is to encourage local, innovative strategies that link public housing assistance with public and private resources to enable participating families to increase earned income; reduce or eliminate the need for welfare assistance; and make progress toward achieving economic independence and housing self-sufficiency."

Among these finalists, one team of graduate students will be chosen for the best solution for redevelopment of a senior housing high-rise in Houma, Louisiana.
HUD's Innovation in Affordable Housing Student Design and Planning Competition (www.huduser.org/portal/challenge/about.html) seeks to encourage research and innovation in affordable housing, to raise practitioner and future practitioner capacity, and to foster cross-cutting team-work within the design and community development process.
""These young minds are the future of affordable housing,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""By hosting this competition, we hope to stimulate new ways to tackle old challenges and open more doors to opportunity for years to come.""
HUD and the Houma-Terrebonne Housing Authority (HTHA) challenged multi-disciplinary teams of graduate students to consider the complex challenges associated with rehabbing the current structure or demolishing it and creating new construction. These student participants needed to consider design, community development, and financing elements in order to provide an all-encompassing plan and solution that would allow HTHA to meet its goal of offering safe and sustainable affordable housing to area seniors. Students also needed to understand the needs of the intended residents, the zoning restrictions, and leveraging opportunities.
The four finalist teams are:
University of Minnesota - Team members Hilary Lovelace, Jody Rader, Erika Brown, Atticus Jaramillo, and Zachary Zweifler designed a new construction development. While focusing on intergenerational relationships, the design features 252 ADA accessible units, passive ventilation, and rain gardens, as well as a pavilion and outdoor classroom. University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) - Team members Laura Krawczyk, John Whitcomb, Luis Ochoa, Edith Medina Huarita, and Precy Agtarap proposed a gut retrofit of Bayou Towers. The rehab features universal and active design throughout, as well as a rooftop community garden and digital literacy intergenerational programming. University of Kansas - Team members Savannah Greenlee, Ashton Martin, Kyle Killian, Tu Tran, and Taylor Monsees designed a new construction which features an Intergenerational Living Laboratory to provide health services and research relating to physical, emotional, mental, and social health. The development also features numerous design elements that facilitate aging in place. New York University (NYU) - Team members Constantine Caloudas, Christopher Hayner, Matthew Jupin, Pete Lovanella, and Michelle Gruber created a new construction development which includes retail space and an Early Childcare Center. A variety of on-site services and activities are offered to address the needs of the community.

03/02/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-026.cfm,HUD Awards $150 Million to Provide Permanent Homes and Services to Extremely Low-Income Persons with Disabilities,"WASHINGTON - To help prevent thousands of individuals with disabilities from being unnecessarily institutionalized or possibly falling into homelessness, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced it is awarding $150 million in rental assistance to 25 State Housing Agencies. In turn, the state agencies will provide permanent affordable rental housing and needed supportive services to nearly 4,600 households who are extremely low-income persons with disabilities, many of whom hoping to transition out of institutional settings back to the community.
HUD's support of state housing agencies is made possible through the Section 811 Project Rental Assistance (PRA) program which enables persons with disabilities who earn less than 30 percent of their area's median income to live in integrated, affordable housing. State housing agencies and their state Medicaid and Health and Human Service partner agencies identify, refer, and support target populations of persons with disabilities who require community-based, long-term care services to live independently. This is one of several recent collaborative efforts between HUD and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).
""Everyone needs a stable home to call their own, especially persons with disabilities who can live on their own yet are at risk of becoming homeless,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""These grants will provide real opportunity by cutting health care costs for states while allowing folks to live as independently as possible.""
""Communities and families are stronger when all citizens have the opportunity to fully participate and contribute to society,"" said HHS Secretary Sylvia M. Burwell. ""By providing permanent housing as well as access to needed supportive services, these grants are helping to fulfill the promise of productive, meaningful lives in their communities for people with disabilities.""
Today's announcement reinforces the guiding principles of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the landmark 1999 Supreme Court ruling in Olmstead v. L.C., helping states and local governments to provide services in the most integrated settings appropriate to meet the needs of individuals with disabilities.
Funding has been made available for the following state agencies through HUD's Section 811 PRA program:"
03/11/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-027.cfm,HUD Announces Notice of Intent to Conduct Project Demonstration on Violence Against Women and HIV/AIDS Housing,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced it will take the next step toward an exploratory grant program to assist low-income victims of domestic violence living with HIV/AIDS. HUD released a notice of intent to fund demonstration projects focused on helping this population. The Department shared the announcement at a White House event to commemorate National Women and Girls HIV/AIDS Awareness Day.
The purpose of the notice is to solicit public comment on an exploratory grant program designed to strategically coordinate the expertise and resources of HIV/AIDS housing providers and domestic violence and sexual assault service providers. All comments received will be considered in the development of a Notice of Funding Availability that will explain requirements for the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA)/Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) Project Demonstration, detail project selection criteria, and solicit applications.
""Every person should be able to live in a safe and stable environment,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""This new HUD initiative will help secure this opportunity for those living with HIV/AIDS who've been subjected to domestic violence, providing them with the housing and health services they need to build a better future.""
Through the proposed demonstration, HUD will award grant funds to successful applicants to provide transitional and other temporary rental housing assistance and supportive services to low-income persons living with HIV/AIDS who are victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking. Successful applicants will be required to partner with local domestic violence and sexual assault service providers for client outreach and engagement and for comprehensive supportive services to ensure client success in the program.
This proposed demonstration is in response to a recommendation from the Federal Interagency Working Group on the Intersection of HIV/AIDS, Violence against Women and Girls, and Gender-Related Health Disparities to enhance Federal efforts in addressing HIV and intimate partner violence among homeless and marginally housed women and girls. While the Working Group focuses on women and girls, the housing assistance and supportive services provided through the demonstration will be open to all eligible clients regardless of sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, familial status, marital status, race, color, religion, national origin, disability, or age.
HUD's Office of HIV/AIDS Housing (OHH) and the Department of Justice's Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) have collaborated to identify available resources to support this demonstration. OVW identified over $1.4 million in fiscal year 2014 funding from the Transitional Housing Assistance Grants for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Stalking or Sexual Assault Program. OVW and OHH executed an Interagency Agreement assigning HUD to administer the Transitional Housing Assistance Program grant funds. OHH will also identify HOPWA competitive funding, to the extent available, which can be used for the demonstration grants.
The HOPWA program is the only Federal program dedicated to addressing the housing needs of persons living with HIV/AIDS and their families. Grantees partner with nonprofit organizations and housing agencies to provide housing and support to program beneficiaries.

EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take two months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, 4 months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2%) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90-percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised about three percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found on our web site listed above.
* 90% confidence interval includes zero. The Census Bureau does not have sufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero.

03/19/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-029.cfm,HUD to Connect Low-Income Workers with Job Opportunities Nationwide,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Julián Castro today in Miami announced new changes to strengthen a federal program called ""Section 3"" that directs jobs and training to low-income workers and connects businesses that hire them with HUD-funded contracting opportunities. The initiative would increase opportunities for businesses that hire local public housing residents for HUD-funded projects. In addition to changes to Section 3 requirements, Secretary Castro also announced the launch of a National Section 3 Business Registry. The registry is a searchable online database that local housing authorities, government agencies, and contractors can use to find firms that are self-certified as employing at least 30 percent public housing residents or low-income workers.
""All Americans should have the chance to contribute to the development and growth of their own communities,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""These Section 3 initiatives will connect more hard-working folks and small businesses to local economic opportunities, giving them new tools to secure a more prosperous future.""
Every year, HUD funds create thousands of jobs across the country that range from construction to professional services like accounting or engineering. From 2009-2014, based on data reported by public housing authorities and HUD modeling, approximately 170,000 jobs were created by HUD for eligible low-income workers through this program.More than $5 billion in HUD-funded contracts has been directed to Section 3 businesses since 2009. While businesses are only required to hire 30 percent low-income workers, that goal has been exceeded nationally. About 50 percent of new hires for HUD-funded contracts are low-income workers or public housing residents.
Section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 states that, ""employment and other economic opportunities generated by Federal financial assistance for housing and community development programs shall, to the greatest extent feasible, be directed toward low- and very low-income persons, particularly those who are recipients of government assistance for housing, and to businesses that employ them."" Since 1994, the Section 3 program has been governed by an interim regulation. For the first time in 20 years, HUD is proposing a new rule today that would expand opportunities for public housing residents and low-income workers.
In 2012, HUD launched a five-city pilot Section 3 Business Registry in Detroit, Los Angeles, Miami, New Orleans and Washington, DC to help local public agencies better connect local businesses that hire low-income residents and workers with the contracting and economic development opportunities created by HUD-funded housing and development projects, something that is required under Section 3 guidelines. Nearly 1,000 businesses have signed up for the registry nationally. Today, in Miami, Secretary Castro applauded the nearly 300 Section 3 businesses that have signed up for the registry statewide. HUD announced that the initiative will now become national.
In addition, the proposed rule announced today would recognize new HUD programs established since 1994 that are required to meet low-income and public housing resident hiring goals. It also clarifies vague language in the interim rule and eases challenges to achieving compliance. HUD is currently accepting feedback on the proposed rule (www.huduser.org/portal/publications/pdf/Sec_3_Proposed_Rule.pdf) during a 60-day public comment period. To read more about HUD's proposed rule amendment to Section 3 please visit here (www.huduser.org/portal/economicOpportunities.html).

03/24/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-027a.cfm,HUD to Implement Expanded Protections for Survivors of Domestic Violence,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Julián Castro today announced a new proposed rule to increase protections for domestic violence survivors. The rule would implement the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 (VAWA 2013), which expands HUD's authority to protect survivors of domestic and dating violence, stalking, and sexual assault who are residing in housing assisted by HUD.
By proposing this rule, HUD is taking a positive step to ensure that survivors of abuse will not live in fear of losing their homes simply because of their status as a survivor. HUD is committed to helping survivors of domestic violence through access to safe and affordable housing, and to enforcing laws that prevent landlords from discriminating against these survivors.
""Every person deserves to live in a safe, stable home,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""This proposed rule will expand critical protections for survivors of domestic violence across HUD's housing programs. Now, many more brave women, men and children will have the opportunity to build a better future by living in an environment free from abuse.""
The VAWA 2013 reauthorization expanded legal protections to nearly all HUD programs. Previously, only residents of public housing and Section 8 tenant-based and project-based programs were covered through the VAWA 2005 legislation. Newly covered programs include:
HOME Investment Partnerships program § 202 supportive housing for the elderly Section 236 Rental Program § 811 supportive housing for people with disabilities Section 221(d)(3) Below Market Interest Rate (BMIR) Program HOPWA (Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS) housing program HUD's McKinney-Vento homeless programs Low-Income Housing Tax Credit properties (www.huduser.org/portal/datasets/lihtc.html) U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Housing properties (www.rd.usda.gov/programs-services)
• HOME Investment Partnerships program
• § 202 supportive housing for the elderly
• Section 236 Rental Program
• § 811 supportive housing for people with disabilities
• Section 221(d)(3) Below Market Interest Rate (BMIR) Program
• HOPWA (Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS) housing program
• HUD's McKinney-Vento homeless programs
• Low-Income Housing Tax Credit properties (www.huduser.org/portal/datasets/lihtc.html)
• U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Housing properties (www.rd.usda.gov/programs-services)
A complete list of key housing provisions in VAWA 2013 is available here.
VAWA 2013 now also specifically extends housing protections to survivors of sexual assault, and adds ""intimate partner"" to the list of eligible relationships covered in the definition of domestic violence. VAWA 2013 also requires appropriate agencies to adopt a plan to respond to tenants' requests to be transferred to a different housing unit if they believe they are in danger if they do not move. In his Fiscal Year 2016 budget, President Obama requested $37.5 million to fund 5,000 new Housing Choice Vouchers specifically to help victims and survivors of domestic or dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking who require such an emergency transfer from their current assisted housing.
VAWA 2013 continues to bar eviction and termination due to a tenant's status as a survivor, and requires landlords to maintain survivor-tenant confidentiality. It also continues to prohibit a tenant who is a survivor of domestic violence from being denied assistance, tenancy, or occupancy rights based solely on domestic violence having been committed against them.
The proposed rule will be open for a 60-day public comment period. Read the proposed rule here."

03/31/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-034.cfm,About 70 Percent of Homes in Miami and Tampa have an Emergency Kit; Rates Vary by Metro Area,"WASHINGTON - More than half, 51.5 percent, of U.S. homes have a prepared emergency evacuation kit, according to new metropolitan area-level American Housing Survey statistics released jointly today by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and the U.S. Census Bureau.
The level of preparedness varies by metro area, with about 70 percent of households in the Miami and Tampa, Fla., metro areas having emergency supplies readily available in the event of an evacuation. The Austin (Texas), Chicago and Minneapolis metro areas had among the lowest rate of homes with an emergency preparedness kit.
These statistics come from new disaster preparedness questions, one of four topics added to the 2013 American Housing Survey. The three other topics are community involvement, neighborhood characteristics and public transportation. The disaster preparedness questions examine, for example, how many households are prepared for emergency situations such as fire, terrorist attack or large-scale natural disaster.
""The American Housing Survey added questions on emergency preparedness in response to recent natural disasters, such as Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Sandy,"" said Kurt G. Usowski, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Economic Affairs at HUD. ""Emergency responders at all levels of government along with policymakers and businesses can use the American Housing Survey for planning and decision-making.""
These new questions will help policymakers determine if households in the United States have a critical plan in place for all members of their homes, including their pets. Some of the survey's new questions found that nationally 48.4 percent of homes have a pet, 54.3 percent have an emergency water supply, and 18.3 percent of single-family homes (excluding manufactured/mobile homes) have a generator.
""Our goal is to prepare communities for the risks posed by extreme weather and other natural disasters and strengthen communities' ability to be economically and culturally resilient in the face of a changing climate and natural disasters,"" Usowski said.
In addition to the new questions, the American Housing Survey continues to include valuable economic indicators, such as the number of underwater mortgages (owing more than the value of the home) in major cities and median monthly property insurance costs. There is vast regional variation among the metro areas sampled in the 2013 American Housing Survey in the underwater mortgages measure, with high percentages in Detroit and selected Sun Belt areas (Las Vegas; Tucson, Ariz.; and Tampa, Miami and Orlando, Fla.) and comparatively low rates in the Texas and Oklahoma metros.
The American Housing Survey is the most comprehensive housing survey in the United States. Every odd-numbered year, data are collected to provide national and selected metropolitan area statistics. The 2013 survey results released today list statistics for 25 metropolitan areas.
New from the American Housing Survey
Added to the 2013 survey were questions about disaster preparedness, community involvement, neighborhood characteristics and public transportation. Below are highlights from some of the findings from the 25 metropolitan areas surveyed:
The Austin, Chicago, Minneapolis, Tucson, Boston, Rochester (N.Y.), and Nashville (Tenn.) metro areas had among the lowest rate of homes with an emergency preparedness kit. Austin, Louisville (Ky.), Nashville, Oklahoma City, San Antonio and Tucson were among the highest metro areas with pets in the home with over 53 percent of homes owning at least one pet. The New York City metro area had the lowest at around 25 percent of homes with a pet. Nationally, 27.8 percent of households volunteered in their community. The Minneapolis, Louisville, Hartford (Conn.), Boston and Seattle metro areas had some of the highest rates of volunteerism with over 34 percent of households providing free work in their communities. 78.7 percent of U.S. households agreed that their neighbors could be trusted. Minneapolis, Nashville and Richmond (Va.) metro areas had among the highest rates of households who felt their neighbors were trustworthy. Some of the lowest rates came from Las Vegas, Orlando and New York City. 14.3 percent of U.S. households lived in neighborhoods with bike lanes, while 45.3 percent had adequately lit sidewalks. The New York City metro area had the highest rate of adequately lit sidewalks at 75.8 percent. The lowest rates were in Nashville, Oklahoma City, Richmond and Tucson.

Standard Results from the American Housing Survey
In addition to the new survey topics, the American Housing Survey covers topics such as physical housing characteristics and financial characteristics that can be tracked historically. Below are highlights from the national and metropolitan statistical area level findings:
Median monthly property insurance for owners was highest in the Miami metro area at $167 per month. Homeowners in Rochester, Tucson and Las Vegas had among the lowest median monthly property insurance payments, ranging from $42 to $45. Nationally, 11.1 percent of homeowners considered themselves to be underwater on their mortgages because they had a reported mortgage balance greater than their opinion of their home's value. Detroit, Las Vegas, Orlando, Tampa, Miami and Tucson reported some of the highest rates of underwater mortgages, with at least 19 percent of households owing more on their mortgages than their homes are thought to be worth. Nationally, median monthly real estate taxes were $150. The Northern New Jersey metro area had the highest median monthly real estate taxes at $643. Some of the lowest taxes were found in Louisville, Oklahoma City, Tampa, Las Vegas, Nashville and Jacksonville (Fla.), which ranged from $100 to $111 per month. The majority of metro areas sampled had less than 10 percent of households reporting their drinking water to be unsafe. The highest reported rate came from Las Vegas, with 24.6 percent of households considering their water to be unsafe.

03/31/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-037.cfm,"Austin, Texas Wins Prestigious HUD Secretary Award","WASHINGTON - For nearly 70 years, Robert Mueller Municipal Airport thrived on the east side of Austin, Texas but as the city grew, Austin needed a modern international airport to serve its residents. While Austin Bergstrom International Airport is now the state capital's airport, the challenge facing city planners is what to do with the 711 acres of land now situated in the heart of Austin.
Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the American Planning Association (APA) recognized the City of Austin with the 2015 HUD Secretary's Opportunity and Empowerment Award (www.huduser.org/portal/about/OppEmpowerAward_2015_1.html) for its Mueller Redevelopment and Reuse Plan. The plan called for the conversion of the former Mueller Municipal Airport into a mixed-use, mixed-income community to help revitalize East Austin.
Presented jointly by HUD and APA, the HUD Secretary's Award recognizes a plan, program, or project that has been in effect for at least three years and improves the quality of life for low- and moderate-income community residents. Emphasis is placed on how creative housing, economic development and private investments have been used in or with a comprehensive community development plan to empower a community.
""The City of Austin has developed a plan for progress,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""It transforms an unused municipal space into an asset that will provide local residents with employment, entrepreneurial and housing opportunities for generations to come. I congratulate and commend all those who came together for this common vision, and applaud their commitment to shaping a future full of new and inclusive growth.""
Neighborhood demand and voter approval set the foundation for moving the Mueller Municipal Airport and starting redevelopment efforts on the 700-acre site. The Mueller Redevelopment and Reuse Plan was adopted in 2000 and included six redevelopment goals including fiscal responsibility; economic development; and East Austin revitalization. The city engaged in a public-private partnership with master-developer Catellus in 2004 to help implement and finance the plan.
Mueller Airport is now being transformed with a mix of housing, jobs, services and mobility improvements that reconnect adjoining neighborhoods. Since 2006, 2,300 residential units of the projected 5,900 homes have been completed or are under construction. Twenty-five percent of the homes are affordable, and offered to income-qualified households. And more than 4,850 jobs are available of 13,000 anticipated, reflecting a range of income levels.
The Mueller Redevelopment and Reuse Plan is an example of a community-led vision over coming challenges to become a compact, mixed-use, livable community. First, the plan is an example of an enduring successful public-private partnership. Second, it addressed regulations that hindered or prevented compact development. Third, it included a diversity of housing types.
""The Mueller Redevelopment plan is a model of a public-private partnership working for the public good,"" said W. Shedrick Coleman, 2015 APA Awards Jury chair. ""The community came together, envisioned a future and is working towards the plan's realization.""
""The Mueller Community reflects the initial vision first stated 30 years ago: a sustainable, diverse, affordable community that could spur economic development, be compatible with the surrounding neighborhoods, be fiscally responsible, and help revitalize East Austin,"" said Mayor Steve Adler of the City of Austin. ""We believe our efforts, and this award, confirm that neighborhoods dream big when they are empowered and those dreams can come true with effective planning, partnership, and execution.""
""Mueller is a wonderful example of the imagination and creativity of the citizens of Austin. It's a prototype of how cities of the future might grow,"" said Kevin Johns, Economic Development Director of the City of Austin. ""And we believe it's a fusion of the best of city planning and economic resiliency and could be replicated internationally.""
The Mueller Redevelopment Plan and additional APA award winners will be honored at the 2015 National Planning Awards luncheon April 20, 2015, at the Washington State Convention Center in Seattle, Washington."
03/31/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-038.cfm,HUD Returns Detroit Housing Commission to Local Control,"WASHINGTON - After almost 10 years, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it returned the Detroit Housing Commission (DHC) to local control from federal receivership effective March 16, 2015. HUD took possession of the DHC in July 2005 because of un-auditable financial records, the distressed physical condition of housing units, significant regulatory compliance deficiencies, and HOPE VI grants that were in default for lack of progress with redevelopment projects.
Part of the improvement actions taken by HUD and the DHC included hiring an Executive Director to manage and oversee day-to-day operations, completing reductions in staffing levels to fit the current asset management of the DHC, increasing the occupancy rate of public housing units to 97 percent (up from 70% in 2005).
""Today represents an important milestone in Detroit's road to recovery,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""After a decade of federal oversight, I am pleased to say that the once-troubled Detroit Housing Commission has made a complete turnaround and that HUD is handing back the keys to Mayor Mike Duggan and the agency's Board of Commissioners. It's because of our partnership with local leaders and public housing residents that the people of this great city once again have a housing commission that they can count on.""
""The Detroit Housing Commission plays a critical role in making sure low-income Detroiters have access to quality, affordable housing,"" said Detroit Mayor, Mike Duggan. ""I'd like to thank our partners at HUD and the Housing Commission for their hard work in making this day possible. We look forward to building on the progress they already have made.""
The DHC has demonstrated consistent accountability and progress, which prompted HUD to return the Housing Commission to local control. Since 2007 the DHC has received a full audit with an unqualified financial opinion, and since 2010 it has met significant financial and management requirements to comply with HUD regulations. In 2014, the DHC received a passing HUD inspection score for every public housing development for the first time in more than two decades, and achieved the designation of ""Standard Performer"" while improving their public housing assessment score of 84 percent, up from 24 percent in 2005.
The DHC has also substantially completed the construction of the delayed HOPE VI projects, including the Cornerstone Estates, Emerald Springs Apartments, the Woodbridge Estates and the Gardenview Estates, creating or rehabilitating over 500 public housing units.
A new five member Board of Commissioners was appointed by Mayor Mike Duggan on March 16, 2015 and will be providing oversight of the DHC. For more information on the DHC please visit www.dhcmi.org."
04/01/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-035.cfm,HUD Kicks Off Fair Housing Month 2015 with Launch of New National Media Campaign,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today kicked off Fair Housing Month 2015 with the launch of a new national media campaign that will help the public recognize various forms of housing discrimination and what they should do if they believe their housing rights have been violated.
""Every American deserves a fair chance to secure safe and stable housing,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""At the core of everything we do to improve housing opportunities is a firm belief that no family should ever be denied the opportunity to own or rent a home because of what they look like, where they come from, how they get around, how they speak, who they love and other circumstances of life. HUD's fair housing efforts level the playing field so that folks have a solid foundation upon which they can achieve their dreams and build for the future.""
The new campaign, which consists of print and digital Public Service Announcements, is being launched as the nation celebrates the 47th anniversary of the passage of the 1968 Fair Housing Act, the landmark law that was passed one week after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
Each April, HUD, local communities, fair housing advocates, and fair housing organizations across the country commemorate Fair Housing Month by hosting an array of activities that enhance Americans' awareness of their fair housing rights, highlight HUD's fair housing enforcement efforts, and emphasize the importance of ending housing discrimination.
Secretary Castro launched the month-long commemoration with an event at HUD Headquarters that featured Vanita Gupta (www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-holder-announces-vanita-gupta-serve-acting-assistant-attorney-general-civil), the Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division and a national leader in the civil rights community.
Through an array of enforcement activities, fair housing policy initiatives, and education and outreach efforts, HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity is taking action against individuals and housing providers that discriminate.
Last year, HUD and its Fair Housing Assistance Program partner agencies received 8,468 complaints alleging discrimination based on one or more of the Act's seven protected classes: race, color, national origin, religion, gender, family status, and disability. During that period, the categories with the highest number of complaints were disability and race, respectively. In particular, HUD has had success in combatting lending discrimination as well as various forms of discrimination faced by women and persons with disabilities.
""Forty-seven years after the Fair Housing Act became law, the work we are doing to address housing discrimination is just as important, just as relevant,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Every day, we have the law on our side to create better and stronger communities where everyone has an equal chance to obtain the home of their choosing.""
In addition to increasing awareness, the new campaign is designed to further HUD's fair housing enforcement efforts. The campaign isbeing conducted in partnership with the National Fair Housing Alliance (NFHA) and includes print and digital PSAs in various languages, webinars, training presentations, brochures, online videos and social media outreach.
""The national media campaign has several components that will be released throughout 2015, including outreach through social media and online efforts. It's very important that we continuously teach housing consumers about their rights through a variety of media channels so they will be better prepared to both recognize discrimination when it occurs and know where to go for help,"" said Shanna L. Smith, President and CEO of the National Fair Housing Alliance, HUD's partner in the creation of the campaign. ""Discrimination in housing-related transactions can be very subtle, so it's important for home seekers to be on the alert.""
The new campaign specifically focuses on the value of diverse communities in English and Spanish, the hurdles families can sometimes face when attempting to buy a home in English and Spanish, and the types of discrimination veterans often encounter. To view all the new announcements please visit National Fair Housing Alliance (www.nationalfairhousing.org/).
In the past year HUD cases have included:
Race/National Origin Discrimination
A groundbreaking settlement with Illinois-based Midland States Bancorp, resolving allegations that the bank avoided doing business in predominantly African American and Hispanic neighborhoods in St. Louis, Missouri, and northern Illinois, a practice known as ""redlining."" The settlement requires Midland States Bancorp to originate $8 million in mortgage loans in majority minority neighborhoods and open full-service branches in Illinois and St. Louis.
Maternity Lending Discrimination
Under a settlement HUD reached with Wells Fargo Home Mortgage last October, the bank agreed to pay $5 million to resolve allegations that the lender discriminated against women who were pregnant, or had recently given birth, and were on maternity leave. Since 2010, 113 maternity leave discrimination complaints have been filed with HUD, resulting in more than 53 settlements for a total of nearly $6.6 million in compensation for victims.
Disability Discrimination
Last November, HUD reached a $104,000 settlement agreement with Mt. Laurel, NJ-based Freedom Mortgage Corporation, resolving allegations that it discriminated against loan applicants with disabilities by requiring them to provide medical or other documentation regarding their disability. The owner and operator of a 500-unit HUD-subsidized apartment complex in DeKalb, Illinois, agreed to pay $255,000 to settle allegations that they failed to meet the needs of residents with disabilities and retaliated against a resident for requesting a reasonable accommodation.
Discrimination Against Domestic Violence Survivors
In a case the Department charged in Maryland, HUD's investigation found that the woman was served with an eviction notice because the police were called after she and her son were violently stabbed by her then boyfriend. In February, the Department reached an agreement with the City of Berlin, NH, after filing a complaint against it alleging a Fair Housing Act violation. Berlin had enacted an ordinance requiring landlords to evict tenants cited three or more times for ""disorderly action,"" which included domestic violence incidents. As a result of the settlement, the city amended its ordinance to make it clear that the ordinance is not to be used against victims of reported incidents of domestic violence.
National Origin Discrimination
HUD worked with the state of Nebraska to turn findings of non-compliance into a settlement that improves access to public benefits for persons with limited English proficiency, including a Language Assistance Plan.
Discrimination Against Families with Children
Napa Valley apartment owners paid two former tenants a total of $7,000, eliminated the rule that limited pool usage by children during the day, and provided its employees with fair housing training. In a similar case, HUD reached an agreement with the owners and managers of a Denver-area apartment complex, requiring the owners to construct a $10,000 accessible playground on the property. And in Hartford, CT, HUD and the Connecticut Fair Housing Center, reached a $24,000 settlement with a real estate company settling allegations that it published discriminatory listings and advertisements for condominiums specifying that children were not permitted."
04/02/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-036.cfm,HUD Awards $24 Million to Help Low-Income Public Housing Residents Secure Higher Paying Jobs,"WASHINGTON - In an effort to help low-income residents find higher-paying jobs, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced a $24 million investment for the next four years to nine public housing authorities and their partners to help residents increase their earned income and become self-sufficient. HUD's Jobs-Plus Pilot Program supports work readiness and connects public housing residents with employment, education and financial empowerment services—and it's a model proven to help public housing residents find and keep jobs. Read more about how these PHAs will put their grant funds to work.
Today in Charlotte, N.C., HUD Secretary Julián Castro announced the funding during a news conference with Mayor Dan Clodfelter, Congresswoman Alma Adams (NC-12), and the city's Housing Authority, one of the grantees. With HUD celebrating its 50th anniversary this year, Castro said part of HUD's mission is to advance opportunities for all Americans.
""Job-Plus is not just an initiative, it's a pathway to greater prosperity for folks across the nation,"" said Secretary Castro."" ""Empowering public housing residents with new economic and educational tools is good for their families and for our nation. HUD is always looking for innovative ways to help others secure new opportunities and to reach their full potential. With this funding, local public housing authorities will be able to help more Americans find employment in today's job market so they can build a better tomorrow.""
HUD's Jobs-Plus Pilot Program links the housing authority system with employment and training services, new rent rules that make work pay, and neighbor-to-neighbor outreaching— demonstrating how cross-agency partnerships make a difference in the economic prospects of public housing residents. These grants will employ several principles of the Administration's Job Driven training checklist (https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/docs/skills_report.pdf) to ensure that public housing residents are connected to a program that is using evidence-based practices that work for job seekers and employers.
The Jobs-Plus Pilot Program capitalizes on a successful demonstration (www.mdrc.org/publication/jobs-plus-promising-strategy) program that combines traditional employment, training and job placement services with a rent incentive and a place-based investment in building community support for work. The program model, which requires PHAs to partner with Department of Labor American Jobs Centers, promotes initiatives to improve employment and earnings outcomes, a critical element of self-sufficiency for all families. Targeting an entire development helps residents support each other through the process."
04/08/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-039.cfm,HUD Study Finds Public Housing Authorities Underfunded When Administering Housing Choice Voucher Program,"WASHINGTON - Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) across the country are significantly underfunded in managing the federal government's largest low-income housing assistance program which serves 2.1 million households nationwide. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today published its Housing Choice Voucher Program Administrative Fee Study (www.huduser.org/portal/hcvfeestudy.html) which concludes high-performing PHAs operating well-managed voucher programs are increasingly hard-pressed to meet the actual cost burden of this program.
Congress directed HUD to gather comprehensive and detailed data on the administrative costs associated with operating the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) Program. The purpose of the study is to better understand how much it costs for a PHA to administer a high-performing and efficient HCV program and to use the findings to propose a new funding methodology.
""This study offers clear evidence on what local housing authorities already know to be true - that current funding limits on their administrative fees don't come close to meeting the reasonable costs of operating a well-run voucher program,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""We're asking Congress to consider the President's 2016 Budget request which will go a long way toward filling this gap and, ultimately, will help more Americans reach their goals and achieve upward mobility.""
HUD's proposed Fiscal Year 2016 budget seeks $2 billion in administrative fees, which is an increase of $490 million from 2015. The HCV Program is administered by approximately 2,300 local, regional, and state PHAs. The funding these PHAs receive for running the HCV program includes the housing subsidy itself, plus administrative fees to cover the costs of running the program. The study seeks to answer four primary research questions:
What accounts for the variation in administrative costs across PHAs? How much does it cost to run a high-performing and efficient HCV program? What would be an appropriate formula for allocating administrative fees to PHAs operating HCV programs on an ongoing basis? Is there a minimum size below which an HCV program cannot successfully operate on administrative fees alone?
• What accounts for the variation in administrative costs across PHAs?
• How much does it cost to run a high-performing and efficient HCV program?
• What would be an appropriate formula for allocating administrative fees to PHAs operating HCV programs on an ongoing basis?
• Is there a minimum size below which an HCV program cannot successfully operate on administrative fees alone?
This report addresses each of these research questions and presents the findings of the study's time measurement and cost data collection effort, which took place between 2012 and 2014 at 60 high-performing PHAs across the country.
""The new administrative fee formula we're recommending provides hard evidence of the real world costs of providing quality service to low-income voucher residents,"" said Lourdes Castro-Ramirez, HUD's Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing. ""If public housing authorities are expected to continue providing the kind of critical support needed by the most vulnerable in our communities, then there must be a more rational way of allocating administrative fees that both reflects and keeps pace with what's really driving the costs of the voucher program.""
Background
For much of the voucher program's history—starting with the Section 8 Certificate Program in the 1970s—program administrative fees have been calculated based upon historical Fair Market Rents (FMRs). The study suggests HUD cease using FMRs as a basis for the allocation of fees because actual costs are driven by other factors, notably local wages, health insurance costs, program size, family characteristics, and the extent to which voucher-assisted families live at substantial distance from the PHA's main office.

HUD will be hosting a Public Briefing on the Housing Choice Voucher Program Administrative Fee Study in the Brooke-Mondale Auditorium on April 17, 2015 from 11:00 am - 12:30 pm. Read more and RSVP to this briefing (www.huduser.org/HousingChoiceVouchers/index.html)."
04/09/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-040.cfm,"HUD Secretary Castro, Senator Charles Schumer, and Mayor De Blasio Announce Nation's Largest Energy Savings Program for a Public Housing Authority","NEW YORK - U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Julián Castro, Senator Charles Schumer, Mayor Bill de Blasio, New York City Housing Authority Chair Shola Olatoye, and Director of the Mayor's Office of Sustainability Nilda Mesa announced today the launch of the largest energy savings program for any public housing authority in the country. Through a series of competitive Energy Performance Contracts (EPC), it is estimated that at least $100 million in work will occur across nearly 300 NYCHA developments to upgrade and retrofit thousands of buildings, dramatically reducing greenhouse gas emissions and generating tens of millions of dollars in cost savings, as well as creating more than 500 jobs.
The EPC, facilitated by HUD, is part of the Mayor's sweeping green buildings plan and commitment to an 80 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. New York City is the largest city in the world to make that commitment. In addition to contributing to the City's work to dramatically reduce emissions, NYCHA can mitigate the impact of rising utility costs through a reduction in consumption and help preserve funds for vital repairs and other building upgrades by leveraging alternative sources to finance energy and water upgrades.
""We're committed to investing in our nation's affordable housing future in a way that makes both economic and environmental sense. The Energy Performance Contract we're implementing for New York City's public housing communities - the largest energy savings program for any public housing authority in the nation - achieves that goal,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""Today's news is more than just a victory for public housing families - it's also a win for every New Yorker, and it sends a clear signal that every community in this great city will share in New York's sustainable future.""
""New York City must continue to set the pace when it comes to the bold climate action our cities and our planet need,"" said Mayor de Blasio. ""That's why we're the largest city in the world to commit to an 80 percent reduction in emissions by 2050 - beginning with a sweeping green buildings plan that includes the nation's largest public housing energy savings program. The benefits of these upgrades will be measured in many ways: in a real reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, in tens of millions of dollars in savings for NYCHA, and in hundreds of good jobs created. This collaboration with HUD means a greener, more efficient future for NYCHA and millions more New Yorkers.""
""Making thousands of NYCHA buildings run cleaner, cheaper and better for countless residents will reinforce the fact that there's no place like home. Coupled with the news of last week's $3 billion dollar federal investment, HUD's own commitment to begin $100 million dollars worth of upgrades is essential to meeting the needs of tenants. This work - enhancing lighting, fine-tuning heating and cooling and ensuring energy efficiency - is both long-awaited and welcomed. The benefits to our environment will also allow New York City to set a national example and standard others will emulate. Yes, the nation's largest ever energy savings program belongs nowhere else but at NYCHA and here in New York,"" said U.S. Senator Charles Schumer.
Over the last ten years, NYCHA's utility costs for water, electricity and heat have increased 64 percent from $350 million to $576 million, though consumption has increased just 9% during that time.
The energy-saving measures will include upgrades to heating plants and distribution systems, and installation of energy efficient lighting and apartment sensors. The heating-related upgrades will enable more reliable and efficient heating for NYCHA residents.
The first RFP for the initiative, to be issued by NYCHA on April 16, will seek an energy services company (ESCO) that can maximize both energy savings and cost savings across89 properties housing 87,000 apartments - or approximately 50 percent of NYCHA's public housing portfolio - representing over 200,000 residents. NYCHA's annual utility cost for these 89 developments is almost $300 million. Subsequent RFPs will seek the same competitive bids for additional properties, ultimately reaching nearly 300 developments with the potential to cut energy and reduce emissions, creating the equivalent environmental impact of taking tens of thousands of cars off the road.
HUD is providing NYCHA with dedicated technical assistance, helping to determine the scope of the EPC and how it can be integrated into NYCHA's long-term capital plans. HUD's technical assistance will also identify potential energy conservation measures, quantify their potential savings, and rate and rank these potential measures based on savings potential, costs, and prioritized capital needs. In addition, HUD will allow NYCHA to allocate savings to future, innovative energy efficiency and water-saving projects, further helping the Authority's bottom line.
""It is imperative that we use every opportunity to fund building improvements at NYCHA without increasing the existing capital deficit of billions of dollars,"" said Deputy Mayor for Housing and Economic Development Alicia Glen. ""The Energy Performance Contracts do just that, allowing for upgrades that will benefit the Authority's bottom line in the long term while contributing to major reductions in emissions and creating quality green jobs.""
""Sustainability plays a critical role in preserving public housing,"" said NYCHA Chair Shola Olatoye. ""The launch of this initiative will help replace and repair outdated NYCHA systems with energy-efficient technology intended to cut energy consumption and costs. These repairs are especially important in light of NYCHA's substantial outstanding capital needs and will also mean an improved quality of life for NYCHA residents.""
""Residents of NYCHA experience some of the highest rates of asthma in the City and are among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. This is a big win,"" said Nilda Mesa, Director of the Mayor's Office of Sustainability. ""By cutting energy, we also cut greenhouse gas emissions and air pollutants that trigger asthma and other respiratory diseases. The new boilers and new lighting will be more reliable and use less energy than the ones in place, as well as be cheaper to run. By maintaining and managing energy systems more closely, residents benefit.""
As part of the Mayor's green buildings plan released last fall - One City: Built to Last [http://nyc.gov/BuiltToLast] - the City has committed to retrofitting every public building with any significant energy use by 2025 and to working with private buildings to provide ambitious target reductions and - if necessary - mandates. Public housing is a key component of the City's building retrofits plan.
The Energy Performance Contract will be subject to NYCHA's recently negotiated Project Labor Agreement with the Building and Construction Trades Council (BCTC) of Greater New York, as well as its affiliated unions. The PLA will result in both swifter capital repairs and access to union jobs and training for NYCHA residents.
The EPC will enable NYCHA to achieve energy and water savings without having to provide upfront capital dollars. The selected energy services company will implement energy and water conservation measures and provide a guarantee of energy savings from these measures. These guaranteed savings will enable NYCHA to secure a loan to cover the costs of installation, and will result in additional cash flow to help repay the loan. The savings from the newly installed energy and water measures are subject to change based on fluctuations in utility pricing.
In 2000, NYCHA executed a $15 million EPC that included heating system and energy efficient lighting retrofits at five developments, which has already enabled savings of almost $14 million and over 5,000,000 BTUs. In 2012, NYCHA launched an $18 million EPC to complete energy efficiency lighting retrofits at 17 developments; and heating plant replacement, apartment temperature sensors, instantaneous water heaters at six additional developments. Construction is anticipated to be complete in early summer.
NYCHA expects to select an energy services company from the initial RFP by the summer of 2015 and begin construction in the summer of 2016. The Authority will be issuing subsequent RFPs to cover the rest of its eligible portfolio.
""I'm thrilled that the City and HUD are partnering to make our public housing system more environmentally and fiscally sustainable,"" said City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito. ""The Council has called for these types of changes to in our September climate plan and I'm pleased to see they are moving to reality. Not only will these upgrades greatly improve the lives of NYCHA residents, it will generate cost savings that can be put to further use in improving the must needed repairs that these residents deserve.""
""I am proud that NYCHA is launching this initiative as part of the City's commitment to reduce greenhouse gasses,"" said Public Advocate Letitia James. ""New York is leading the way, and I hope that other cities will follow and make similar pledges to protect our environment. As individuals do their part and improve consumer habits, government must hold up its end of the bargain to ensure a more sustainable future.""
""With the announcement of the nation's largest energy savings program for a public housing authority, it is clear that NYCHA is moving in the right directions; greenhouse gas emissions are going down, while cost savings and job creation figures are going up. Greening our developments is also essential to the long-term work that our City is engaged in to stem the damaging impact of climate change. On behalf of all Brooklynites, particularly our NYCHA residents, I thank Mayor de Blasio, Secretary Castro and Chair Olatoye for this critical investment into our economy, energy, and environment,"" said Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams.
""These funds are not only going to upgrade the buildings to make them more energy efficient and subsequently save millions of taxpayer dollars, but also create good union construction jobs and career opportunities for NYCHA residents, thanks to the project labor agreement between the BCTC and NYCHA. I would like to thank Mayor de Blasio and HUD Secretary Castro for moving forward with this important initiative,"" said Gary LaBarbera, President of the Building and Construction Trades Council of Greater New York.
""We support investing and improving the energy efficiency of our public housing stock. By incorporating these contracts under the PLA with the Building Construction Trades Council ensures the work will be done to the highest quality and give New Yorkers access to jobs and training. We hope the City will continue to work with HUD to green NYCHA and move our City's public housing toward a renewable energy future,"" said Matt Ryan, Executive Director of the Alliance for a Greater New York.
""We support complete retrofitting of NYCHA buildings and these contracts are a good first step in that process. We also support the creation of good jobs for NYCHA residents through the use of the PLA. We will continue to push the administration and HUD to ensuring all our NYCHA buildings are energy efficient and resilient for generations to come,"" said Vernil Robinson, Carleton Manor resident & Community Voices Heard (CVH) leader."
04/14/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-041.cfm,HUD Awards $36 Million in Housing Counseling Grants,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today awarded more than $36 million in grants to hundreds of national, regional and local organizations to help families and individuals with their housing needs and to prevent future foreclosures. HUD's housing counseling grants and the additional funding they help to leverage will assist more than 1.5 million households find housing, make more informed housing choices, or keep their current homes.
See list of all counseling agencies awarded funding today.
HUD is also establishing a new Housing Counseling Federal Advisory Committee to help the Department provide consumers with the knowledge they need to find and sustain decent housing. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 requires HUD's Secretary to appoint no more than 12 individuals from various backgrounds to offer advice to the Department regarding the functions of the Office of Housing Counseling. Read HUD's Notice (https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2015/04/14/2015-08550/establishment-of-the-housing-counseling-federal-advisory-committee-solicitation-of-appointment), which includes information on applying for a position on the Housing Counseling Federal Advisory Committee.
""Access to knowledge and information is vital to every family's success,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""These grants will expand housing opportunities for families across our nation. The evidence is clear: housing counseling works. We look forward to working with our housing counseling partners to empower American families with the tools to prosper.""
More than $34 million will directly support the housing counseling services provided by 29 national and regional organizations, six multi-state organizations, 20 State Housing Finance Agencies (SHFAs) and 215 local housing counseling agencies. In addition, HUD is awarding $2 million to three national organizations to train housing counselors who will receive the instruction and certification necessary to effectively assist families with their housing needs.
The comprehensive housing counseling housing grants announced today were competed through the Department's two-year (FY2014 - FY2015) Comprehensive Housing Counseling Grant Program Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) published March 4, 2014. On April 2, 2015,HUD published a FY 2015 Supplemental NOFA that makes FY2015 funding available to eligible housing counseling agencies that did not receive funding in the awards announced today.
If additional funds are available after the Department makes awards under the Supplemental NOFA, additional funding may become available to the agencies awarded funding today. Should funding become available, HUD may amend these awards and provide additional grant funding.
National and regional agencies distribute much of HUD's housing counseling grant funding to community-based organizations that assist low- and moderate-income families to improve their housing conditions. In addition, these larger organizations help improve the quality of housing counseling services and enhance coordination among counseling providers. Read a summary of each grant, organized by state.
Recent research from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and the Urban Institute continues to find substantial benefits to housing counseling for families who purchase their first homes and those struggling to prevent foreclosure. Read more about research evidence on the role housing counseling can play in reducing mortgage delinquency and foreclosure and helping first-time buyers access and sustain homeownership.
Grant recipients utilize funding to address the full range of families' housing counseling needs. This includes helping homebuyers realistically evaluate their readiness for a home purchase, understand their financing and downpayment options, and navigate what can be an extremely confusing and difficult process. Grantees also help households find affordable rental housing and offer financial literacy training to individuals and families struggling to repair credit problems that restrict their housing options.
In addition to providing counseling to homeowners and renters, these organizations assist homeless persons in finding the transitional housing they need to move toward a permanent place to live. Finally, grantees also assist senior citizens seeking reverse mortgages or (HECM). These agencies provide counseling for the rapidly growing number of elderly homeowners who seek to convert equity in their homes into income that can be used to pay for home improvements, medical costs, and other living expenses.
Housing counseling agencies support fair housing by assisting borrowers in reviewing their loan documentation, to avoid potential mortgage scams, unreasonably high interest rates, inflated appraisals, unaffordable repayment terms, and other conditions that can result in a loss of equity, increased debt, default, and even foreclosure. Likewise, foreclosure prevention counseling helps homeowners facing delinquency or default employ strategies, including expense reduction, negotiation with lenders and loan servicers, and loss mitigation, to avoid foreclosure.

04/14/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-042.cfm,"HUD, Missouri Housing Authority Agreements Increase Access to Housing for Persons with Disabilities and Limited English Proficiency","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has reached two Voluntary Compliance Agreements (VCAs) with the Housing Authority of Independence (HAI), Missouri, resolving HUD findings which showed that the agency failed to provide persons with disabilities and individuals with limited English proficiency meaningful access to its HUD-funded housing programs.
Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance. In addition, Title VI of the Civil Right Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin in programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance.
""Today's agreements demonstrate the Department's ongoing commitment to ensuring that eligible families have equal access to HUD-funded housing programs, regardless of whether they have a physical disability or don't speak English well,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will continue to work with public housing authorities to help them meet their obligation to comply with federal laws.""
HAI owns and operates 522 public housing units and administers more than 1,600 Housing Choice Vouchers.

• Click here to read VCA regarding residents with disabilities.
• Click here to read VCA regarding individuals with limited English proficiency.
The two agreements are the result of a HUD compliance review of the housing authority's operations, which found that the agency was not fulfilling its obligation to provide access to services for persons with disabilities and individuals with limited English proficiency, as required by Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
In particular, HUD's review found that HAI dwelling units, common areas and other HAI facilities were inaccessible to person with disabilities. HUD's review also found that HAI made improper inquiries of people concerning the nature and severity of their disabilities and did not adequately provide reasonable accommodations for those with disabilities.
Under the terms of the agreements with HUD, HAI will submit a corrective plan to make all designated accessible units and common areas compliant with accessibility requirements, including adjusting counter heights, making parking accessible, adjusting mailboxes, adding grab bars, and making other modifications to units and properties. HAI is required to complete all of the modifications within two years. HAI will also revise its policies to cease illegal inquiries into the nature of a person's disability.
In addition, HAI will analyze and assess the needs of its eligible limited English proficient population to ensure that they have reasonable access to all programs and activities. The agency will then prepare and submit to HUD a Language Assistance Plan that will include written policies and procedures. After completing its analysis, HAI will display a sign in the language of the groups served near each of the agency's customer service areas. The signs will describe the scope of language services that the housing authority offers at that location and inform people that HAI provides language services for individuals with limited English proficiency at no cost.
All current employees will also receive training on the housing authority's duties under the agreements, as well as HAI's Fair Housing Act obligations.
Persons who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to www.hud.gov/fairhousing, or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, which can be accessed through Apple devices, such as iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch, as well as Android devices."
04/20/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-043.cfm,"HUD and VA to Help More Than 9,000 Homeless Veterans Find Permanent Homes","WASHINGTON - In the ongoing effort to end veteran homelessness, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) announced nearly $65 million to help more than 9,300 homeless veterans find a permanent place to call home. The rental assistance announced today is provided through the HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) Program which combines rental assistance from HUD with case management and clinical services provided by VA.
HUD-VASH works in reducing veteran homelessness because it provides funding for both the housing and supportive services that are essential for ending homelessness for tens of thousands of veterans nationwide. See the local impact of the housing assistance announced today.
Today in Seattle, HUD Secretary Julián Castro announced the funding with Rep. Denny Heck (WA-10), Rep. Dave Reichert (WA-8), and Seattle Mayor Ed Murray at a residence that houses recipients of HUD-VASH vouchers. With HUD celebrating its 50th anniversary, Secretary Castro is focused on advancing policies that create opportunities for all Americans, including the broader administration goal of ending homelessness among veterans. As the former mayor of San Antonio, Secretary Castro was among the growing ranks of more than 432 mayors who joined the Mayors Challenge to End Veteran Homelessness by the end of 2015 by using federal, local, and nonprofit resources.
HUD-VASH is an important part of the Obama Administration's efforts to provide critical housing and services to veterans experiencing homelessness. This effort also includes HUD's Homeless Assistance Programs, as well as VA's Supportive Services for Veteran Families (SSVF) and Grant and Per Diem (GPD) programs.
""Our nation has a sacred responsibility to support the brave men and women who served with honor, courage and distinction,"" said Secretary Castro. ""These vouchers will help thousands of veterans start a new chapter in their lives and build for the future. We look forward to partnering with communities to ensure that every veteran can secure this opportunity and have a place to call home.""
""The Department of Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development and our federal and local partners should be proud of the gains made reducing veteran homelessness,"" said Secretary of Veterans Affairs Robert McDonald, ""but so long as there remains a veteran living on our streets, we have more work to do. The vouchers made available today are a vital tool to making sure veterans across the country have a home.""
""Ending homelessness among veterans is not a federal goal, it's a national one,"" said Matthew Doherty, Executive Director of the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness. ""This timely deployment of HUD-VASH vouchers is one of the many important ways that the administration is supporting communities to achieve this national goal.""
Since 2008, more than 69,000 vouchers have been awarded and over 88,000 homeless veterans have been served through the HUD-VASH program. Rental assistance and supportive services provided through HUD-VASH are a critical resource for local communities in ending homelessness among our nation's Veterans.
Additionally, Opening Doors: Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness (https://www.usich.gov/tools-for-action/opening-doors) serves as a roadmap for how the federal government will work with state and local communities to confront the root causes of homelessness, especially among former servicemen and women. To support communities as they progress towards the goal of ending veteran homelessness, USICH has identified strategies that increase collaboration and coordination among programs serving veterans experiencing homelessness.
In the HUD-VASH program, VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) assess veterans experiencing homelessness before referring them to local housing agencies for these vouchers. Decisions are based on a variety of factors, most importantly the duration of homelessness and the need for longer term, more intensive support in obtaining and maintaining permanent housing. The HUD-VASH program includes both the rental assistance the voucher provides and the comprehensive case management that VAMC staff offers.
Veterans participating in the HUD-VASH program rent privately owned housing and generally contribute no more than 30 percent of their income toward rent. VA offers eligible homeless veterans clinical and supportive services through its medical centers across the U.S., Guam, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands."
04/21/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-044.cfm,HUD Makes More Than $12 Million Available to Address Mold in Native American and Alaska Native Communities,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is making $12.4 million available to help tribal communities remove and prevent -dangerous mold in homes. The grants are being made available through HUD's Indian Community Development Block Grant (ICDBG) Program, which addresses a wide variety of community development and affordable housing activities.
These grants will support mold remediation in housing units owned or operated by tribes,tribally designated housing entities (TDHE), or tribal organizations or housing that is currently or was previously assisted with HUD funding. Read HUD's funding notice (www.grants.gov/view-opportunity.html?oppId=276032).
""No one should have to sacrifice the health of their children or themselves to keep a roof over their heads,"" said Lourdes Castro-Ramirez, HUD's Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing. ""Through these mold remediation grants, HUD is ensuring that tribal communities have healthier and safer places to call home.""
This source of grant funding was first used in Fiscal Year 2014 through a set-aside to remediate and prevent mold in housing units owned or operated by tribes and TDHEs. Last year nine tribes received grants to remove unhealthy levels of mold, including the Havasupai Tribe in Arizona where mold is a common problem due in part to frequent flooding in low-lying areas of the Grand Canyon.
Established in 1977, HUD's ICDBG program assists Indian tribes and Alaska Native villages to meet their community development needs. Federally recognized Indian tribes, bands, groups or nations (including Alaska Indian, Aleuts and Eskimos,) Alaska Native villages, and eligible tribal organizations compete for this funding. A second more general round of ICDBG funding will be announced later this year.
HUD administers six programs that are specifically targeted to American Indian, Alaska Native, or native Hawaiian individuals and families, and federally recognized tribal governments. In Fiscal Year 2015 HUD received approximately $732 million to fund programs to support housing and development initiatives in American Indian, Alaska Native, and native Hawaiian communities. Through innovative programming, American Indian and Alaska Native tribal governments have created sustainable and community-driven solutions to their housing and community development challenges."
04/22/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-045.cfm,HUD Charges Minnesota Landlord with Housing Discrimination,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is charging the owner and manager of a Minnesota property with housing discrimination for refusing to rent a home to an Asian family of Hmong descent. HUD's charge alleges that Page Edmunds and his company, Renter's Avenue, located in Champlin, Minnesota, refused to rent to the family, attempted to charge them to have the lease translated, made discriminatory statements to them because of their national origin, and retaliated against them for exercising their fair housing rights.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to discriminate in the rental or sale of housing or to impose different rental terms and conditions based on national origin, race, color, religion, sex, familial status or disability.
""Refusing to lease a home to a family or imposing additional fees because of their national origin violates the Fair Housing Act,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Our charge reaffirms HUD's commitment to taking action against housing providers that discriminate against individuals or families because they have limited English proficiency.""
HUD's charge is the result of a fair housing complaint that the family filed after they tried to rent a three-bedroom townhouse in Champlin that is owned by Edmunds. The family, which includes a mother, her adult son and two minors, attempted to rent the townhome in March 2014, after viewing the house in person and paying an $80 application fee. The family's application triggered an exchange of emails with Edmunds that lasted for 10 days in which he requested that they provide their own credit information from a free on-line credit reporting service.
In one email to the adult son, Edmunds asked: ""Are you willing to pay $500 for the translation?"" He went on to state: ""I'm not required to enter into a legal contract with a party that may later claim they didn't understand it.""
In a subsequent email to the woman's son, Edmunds wrote: ""During your visit to the address, you prompted your mom to say something to me. She appears to know some simple phrases, but understanding lease legal terms is very unlikely.""
After the family met all of the requirements for rental, Edmunds told them that they would have to pay $500 to have the lease translated and then denied their application, stating: ""I regret that the rental application has been denied. Both adults would have to sign the contract. [Your mother] appears to have limited English skills. … [T]he contract must be translated to her native language. If not, she could easily break the lease. Such translations are very costly.""
When the woman's son challenged Edmunds' reason for denying their application as unlawful discrimination, Edmunds threatened to report the son, who holds a real estate license, to the Minnesota department that governs real-estate licensing.
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages to the complainants for the harm caused them by the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose fines to vindicate the public interest. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages.
Persons who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed atwww.hud.gov/fairhousing or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, which can be accessed through Apple devices, such as the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch."
04/22/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-046.cfm,NYU Wins HUD's Student Design and Planning Competition,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced a graduate student team from New York University (NYU) the winners of HUD's second annual Innovation in Affordable Housing Student Design and Planning Competition (www.huduser.org/portal/challenge/about.html). The NYU team developed a plan for the redevelopment of a senior affordable housing high-rise in Houma, Louisiana. HUD also announced a team from UCLA as the runner up.
""These bright minds represent the next generation of designers and planners who will produce tomorrow's affordable housing,"" said Katherine O'Regan, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research. ""It's our hope that this competition will excite new creative thinking about how to look at affordable housing.""
HUD's student design and planning competition is intended to encourage research and innovation in affordable housing, to raise practitioner and future practitioner capacity, and to foster cross-cutting team-work within the design and community development process. Multi-disciplinary graduate student teams were asked to create innovative solutions involving design, planning, and finance.
The New York University team will receive a $20,000 award and the team from the University of California Los Angeles will receive $10,000. The competition jurors praised the NYU team members for their sophisticated design that minimized the bulk of the building, thereby responding to the local architectural context. The team also received very high marks for their innovative financing scheme that included a mixed-use redevelopment that incorporates retail for income purposes, creating positive community-wide impact. Their new construction development also included an Early Childcare Center and a variety of on-sites services and activities to address the needs of the community.
The solution from runner up team UCLA was gut rehab with an emphasis on energy efficiency and strong healthcare partnerships. The jurors felt that the team demonstrated a deep understanding of the senior population and its needs. They also liked the team's approach to reuse of materials as well as the proposed new modular façade, which utilized innovative materials and design concepts.
HUD and the Houma-Terrebonne Housing Authority (HTHA) challenged multi-disciplinary teams of graduate students to consider the complex challenges associated with rehabbing the current structure or demolishing it and creating new construction. These student participants had to consider design, community development, and financing elements in order to provide an all-encompassing plan and solution that would allow HTHA to meet its goal of offering safe and sustainable affordable housing to area seniors. Students also needed to understand the needs of the intended residents, the zoning restrictions, and leveraging opportunities.
Last year's winners (www.huduser.org/portal/challenge/past_competitions.html) from Ohio State University developed a design plan for the development of a Revolutionary War-era structure in Bergen County, New Jersey into new permanent supportive housing for homeless veterans."

This is 11.4 percent (±18.6%)* below the revised February rate of 543,000 but is 19.4 percent (±21.8%)* above the March 2014 estimate of 403,000. The median sales price of new houses sold in March 2015 was $277,000; the average sales price was $343,300. The seasonally adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of March was 213,000. This represents a supply of 5.3 months at the current sales rate.
Beginning with the release of April 2015 data on May 26, 2015, estimates of houses sold and for sale by stage of construction will be available on a seasonally adjusted basis as well as not seasonally adjusted basis. Historic seasonally adjusted data will be available back to January 1999 at http://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/historical_data/.

EXPLANATORY NOTES
These statistics are estimated from sample surveys. They are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated average relative standard errors of the preliminary data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2%) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90-percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. Changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show irregular movement. It takes 3 months to establish a trend for new houses sold. Preliminary new home sales figures are subject to revision due to the survey methodology and definitions used. The survey is primarily based on a sample of houses selected from building permits. Since a ""sale"" is defined as a deposit taken or sales agreement signed, this can occur prior to a permit being issued. An estimate of these prior sales is included in the sales figure. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimate of total sales is revised about 4 percent. Changes in sales price data reflect changes in the distribution of houses by region, size, etc., as well as changes in the prices of houses with identical characteristics. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found on our web site listed above.
* 90% confidence interval includes zero. The Census Bureau does not have sufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero."
04/24/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-048.cfm,HUD Announces Changes to Distressed Asset Stabilization Program,"WASHINGTON - Today, HUD announced significant changes to its Distressed Asset Stabilization Program (DASP). In an effort to better serve homeowners looking to avoid foreclosure, loan servicers will now be required to delay foreclosure for a year and to evaluate all borrowers for the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) or a similar loss mitigation program. HUD is making additional improvements to the Neighborhood Stabilization Outcome (NSO) sales portion of DASP which are aimed at increasing non-profit participation. Updates include giving non-profits a first look at vacant properties, allowing purchasers to re-sell notes to non-profits, and offering a non-profit only pool.
Previously, loan servicers could foreclose 6 months after they received the loan and were encouraged, though not required to assess a borrower's qualifications for loss mitigation programs. Purchasers of the geographically targeted neighborhood stabilization pools have always been required to ensure that at least 50 percent of the loans in a pool achieve outcomes that help areas hardest hit by foreclosure avoid the neighborhood decline associated with numerous vacant properties.
""These changes reflect our desire to make improvements that encourage investors to work with delinquent borrowers to find the right solutions for dealing with the potential loss of their home and encourage greater non-profit participation in our sales,"" said Genger Charles, Acting General Deputy Assistant Secretary, Office of Housing. ""The improvements not only strengthen the program but help to ensure it continues to serve its intended purposes of supporting the MMI Fund and offering borrowers a second chance at avoiding foreclosure.""
All of these changes will be subject to stronger reporting requirements including tougher penalties for not complying with quarterly reporting responsibilities and a new requirement to report on borrower outcomes, even when a note is sold after the original purchase.
HUD plans to hold its first sale of 2015 in June.
Distressed Asset Stabilization Program
FHA's note sales program was resumed in 2010 as a direct sale pilot program that allows pools of mortgages headed for foreclosure to be sold to qualified bidders and encourages them to work with borrowers to help bring the loan out of default. In many cases, this is a less expensive alternative to foreclosure and sale as a real estate-owned (REO) property. An FHA servicer can place a loan into the loan pool if the following criteria are met:
The borrower is at least six months delinquent on their mortgage The servicer has exhausted all steps in the FHA loss mitigation process
• The borrower is at least six months delinquent on their mortgage
• The servicer has exhausted all steps in the FHA loss mitigation process
In 2012, as part of an effort to address its seriously delinquent loan portfolio, FHA announced that, over the next several years, it would significantly increase the number of loans it makes available for purchase as well as add a new neighborhood stabilization pool to encourage investment in communities hardest hit by the foreclosure crisis. The ""Neighborhood Stabilization Outcome"" (NSO) pools, as an additional safeguard in distressed communities requires that 50 percent of the loans within a purchased pool achieve a neighborhood stabilizing outcome. If the servicer and borrower are unable to avoid taking the loan through foreclosure, the servicer must achieve some other neighborhood stabilizing outcome, which may include holding the property for rental for at least three years.
Typically, HUD's Distressed Asset Stabilization Program sales are broken into two or more sales, consisting of at least one ""National Sale"" featuring loans from a diversified cross -section of the country, and a ""Neighborhood Stabilizing Outcome"" or ""NSO"" Sale featuring loans drawn from specifically targeted geographic areas."

04/28/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-049.cfm,Obama Administration Announces Eight Additional Promise Zones to Build Community Prosperity,"WASHINGTON - The Obama Administration announced today eight additional Promise Zones across the country, including six cities, one rural area, and one tribal community. Promise Zones are high poverty communities where the federal government partners with local leaders to increase economic activity, improve educational opportunities, leverage private investment, reduce violent crime, enhance public health and address other priorities identified by the community. Through the Promise Zone designation, these communities will work directly with federal, state and local agencies to give local leaders proven tools to improve the quality of life in some of the country's most vulnerable areas.
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Julián Castro and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Tom Vilsack announced new Promise Zone designations in the following communities:
• Camden, New Jersey
• Hartford, Connecticut
• Indianapolis, Indiana
• Minneapolis, Minnesota
• Sacramento, California
• St. Louis/St. Louis County, Missouri
• Pine Ridge Indian Reservation of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, South Dakota
• South Carolina Low Country
""From my time as Mayor to my tenure as Secretary, I've seen first-hand how a Promise Zone designation can spark progress and possibilities in underserved neighborhoods,"" said HUD Secretary Castro. ""A zip code should never limit the hopes that folks have for themselves or for their children. We're proud to be working with a wide-variety of local leaders to strengthen neighborhoods and to unlock doors of opportunity that have been closed for far too long.""
""The Promise Zone effort is proof positive that partnerships are the key to community economic development,"" said Agriculture Secretary Vilsack. ""Families and children in rural and tribal communities are full of potential to compete and succeed in the 21st Century. When we invest our resources and establish long-lasting public-private alliances to strengthen educational opportunities, deliver health care, build infrastructure and create jobs, we are investing in our country's future.""
To celebrate the newly designated zones, events were held across the country in each of the new urban zones. Secretary Julián Castro, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development visited St. Louis, Secretary Arne Duncan, U.S. Department of Education visited Minneapolis, CEO, Wendy Spencer, Corporation for National and Community Service visited Indianapolis, Deputy Secretary, Nani Coloretti, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, visited Hartford and HUD Regional Administrators held events in Camden, NJ and Sacramento, CA. To highlight the rural zone designations of South Carolina's Low Country and South Dakota's Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, Secretary Tom Vilsack hosted media calls for South Carolina and South Dakota.
Background on Promise Zones:
Today's newly designated Promise Zones join five others that President Obama designated in January, 2014 - San Antonio; Los Angeles; Philadelphia; Southeastern Kentucky Highlands and the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma. The work underway in these communities is already showing results. For example:
In San Antonio, the George Gervin Youth Center was awarded a $1.1 million YouthBuild grant from the Department of Labor to establish an education and training program for at-risk young people. The program is enrolling 64 people and preparing them for jobs in good, middle-class careers including jobs in the nursing and the building trades. The Gervin Center also received a $2 million Training-to-Work grant from the Department of Labor to help young men and women participating in work-release programs gain the job skills necessary to launch them on a path to high-demand jobs.

Today's Promise Zone communities were selected from 123 applications from 36 states, Puerto Rico and Washington, DC. Each urban, rural, and tribal Promise Zone applicant was asked to put together a clear description of how the Promise Zone designation would accelerate and strengthen the community's own efforts at comprehensive community revitalization. Each Promise Zone will be coordinated by a lead community based organization in partnership with the Obama Administration. HUD will be the federal lead for the six urban designees, while USDA will serve as the lead federal partner to the tribal and rural Promise Zones.
All Promise Zones will receive priority access to federal investments that further their strategic plans, federal staff on the ground to help them implement their goals, and five full-time AmeriCorps VISTA members to recruit and manage volunteers and strengthen the capacity of the Promise Zone initiatives.
Third Round Promise Zone Competition
A competition to select a third round of Promise Zones will commence later this year. In the Summer of 2015, HUD will publish a Notice in the Federal Register requesting public comment on the proposed selection process, criteria, and submissions for the final round of the Promise Zones initiative. This notice will provide urban, rural, and tribal communities the opportunity to help shape the third round application guide and efforts to support other communities more effectively in future years.

05/04/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-050.cfm,"HUD Charges Santa Fe, New Mexico, Property Owner with Discriminating Against Tenant with Disabilities","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is charging a Santa Fe, New Mexico landlord with housing discrimination for refusing to allow a renter with disabilities to keep her emotional support animal and to have her daughter reside with her. HUD's charge further alleges that Paula Anderson threatened to evict the woman if she did not get rid of her support animal and have her daughter move out. The woman's daughter provided her with disability-related assistance.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to refuse to make reasonable accommodations in policies or practices when a person with a disability requires such accommodations, including refusing to allow a live-in aide and refusing to grant waivers to ""no-pet"" policies for persons who require assistance or support animals. Additionally, the law makes it unlawful to make housing unavailable to any person because of a disability.
""Housing providers need to understand that support animals are not pets, they provide persons with disabilities the stability needed to perform life's everyday activities,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""The Fair Housing Act requires housing providers to grant reasonable accommodations and HUD is committed to taking action if they fail to meet that obligation.""
The case came to HUD's attention when the woman, who has a psychological disability, filed a complaint with HUD alleging that Anderson refused to allow her daughter to live with her, even though her daughter assists her with tasks made difficult by her disability. Anderson also allegedly refused to allow the womanto keep an emotional support animal. In addition, Anderson allegedly threatened to evict the woman unless both her daughter and the assistance animal moved out, despite the fact that the woman provided medical documentation verifying her condition and need for the assistance her daughter and support animal provided.
The woman ultimately had to move out in order to live with her daughter and support animal.
Read HUD's charge against the New Mexico property owner.
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages to the woman for the harm caused her by the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose fines to vindicate the public interest. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages.
In FY 2014, disability was the most common basis of complaints filed with HUD and its partner agencies, being cited as a basis for 4,606 complaints, or 54 percent of the overall total.

The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities and requires that reasonable accommodations to policies be provided when the accommodations are needed because of a disability. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by recipients of federal financial assistance, including cities like Scranton. In addition, Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in all activities, services and programs of public entities.
""Persons with disabilities shouldn't be subjected to the rigid city ordinances that have the practical effect of limiting their housing options,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""We're pleased that the city has entered into this agreement and look forward to working with its leaders as they strive to meet their obligation to comply with federal fair housing laws.""
The case came to HUD's attention when Oxford House, Inc., a non-profit organization that offers housing for persons recovering from drug and alcohol addiction, together with the owner of the subject rental unit, Chris and Rob Properties, LLC, filed a complaint alleging that the city of Scranton violated fair housing laws on the basis of disability.
Specifically, Oxford House and Chris and Rob Properties alleged that Scranton's enforcement of a discriminatory ordinance to condemn their recovery home caused the eviction of six residents with disabilities without notice or an opportunity to find alternative housing, and in turn deprived them of the necessary shelter, resources, and support to continue to facilitate their recovery. Oxford House and Chris and Rob Properties also alleged that the city failed to respond to its request that the property be restored to operation as a reasonable accommodation for these displaced disabled residents.
Under the terms of the agreement, the city of Scranton will pay a total of $100,000 to the complainants. Oxford House will use the money, in part, to compensate the disabled residents aggrieved by the city's actions and to further Oxford House's mission to provide affordable housing and support for people who are recovering from substance abuse or alcoholism. Chris and Rob Properties will use the money, in part, to help restore the subject rental unit to operation as a recovery home for disabled individuals.
The city of Scranton will also amend its ordinance to provide a way to identify and accommodate residents with disabilities prior to their displacement; develop a city-wide reasonable accommodation policy; and provide fair housing training to all city officials who perform code enforcement or deal with licensing and permits.

05/07/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-051.cfm,HUD Offers Over $100 Million in Grants to Clean Up Lead and Other Housing-Related Health Hazards,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today announced that it is making more than $100 million in grants available to help eliminate dangerous lead-based paint hazards from lower income homes in order to protect young children from lead poisoning and other housing related health and safety hazards such as mold and moisture, radon, pests and other asthma triggers.
As HUD approaches its 50th anniversary this year, HUD Secretary Julián Castro is focused on advancing policies that create opportunities for all Americans, including helping children and families secure quality housing by protecting them from the hazards of lead-based paint and other housing related health and safety hazards.
""There's nothing more valuable than good health, and every family deserves to live in housing that offers clean air, safe drinking water, and an environment where they can thrive,"" said Secretary Castro. ""These grants will help communities achieve these goals by eliminating home-related hazards. Working with our partners, we're ensuring that more Americans are able to secure a future that's full of opportunities, not obstacles, for many years to come.""
""Every child deserves the opportunity to grow up in a healthy home, and yet far too many continue to be exposed to dangerous lead paint and other health hazards found in homes,"" said Matt Ammon, Director of the Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes. ""These grants will help communities around the nation to protect families from these exposures and ensure they are able to reach their full potential in life.""
Unsafe and unhealthy homes affect the health of millions of people of all income levels, geographic areas, and walks of life in the U.S. These homes affect the economy directly, through increased utilization of health care services, and indirectly, through lost wages and increased school days missed. The housing improvements communities will make will help prevent injuries and illnesses, reduce associated health care and social services costs, reduce absentee rates for children in school and adults at work, and reduce stress, all which help to improve the quality of life.
HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes promotes local efforts to eliminate dangerous lead paint and other housing related health hazards from lower income homes, stimulate private sector investment in lead hazard control, support cutting-edge research on methods for assessing and controlling housing related health and safety hazards, and educate the public about the dangers of hazards in the home.
The grants to States, local governments and the private sector are being offered through HUD's Lead-Based Paint Hazard Control Program (www.grants.gov/view-opportunity.html?oppId=276412) totaling $48 million, and its Lead Hazard Reduction Demonstration Program totaling $45 million (www.grants.gov/view-opportunity.html?oppId=276395). In these grant programs, HUD is providing an additional $9 million as healthy homes supplemental funds to promote identify and remediate other housing related health hazards in homes with lead based paint hazards.
Due to Fiscal Year 2015 budgetary limitations, there are no available funds for either the Healthy Homes Production or the Asthma Interventions in Public and Assisted Multi-family Housing Grant Programs. HUD's Fiscal Year 2016 Budget proposal now being reviewed by Congress requested $120 million overall for the Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes. At the requested funding level, these grant programs would address the health hazards in over 14,000 homes, especially those of low-income families with children, and spur creation of over 21,000 jobs in each of the three years of the grants. The House of Representatives' Appropriations Committee voted to approve $70 million overall for the Office. The House bill would allow HUD to address hazards in fewer than 6,000 homes.
HUD requires prospective grantees to submit applications electronically at www.grants.gov. Any changes to HUD-published funding notices will be made available to the public through a Federal Register publication and published on this government-wide portal. Applicants are urged to sign up for Grants.gov's notification service to receive periodic updates or changes to these grant offerings."
05/08/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-054.cfm,HUD Announces Fair Housing Charge and Settlement with Landlords in Nevada and Hawaii,"WASHINGTON - As the nation prepares to celebrate Mother's Day on Sunday, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced two fair housing actions involving allegations of housing discrimination involving families with children.
In Carson City, Nevada, HUD charged the owners of a rental property for allegedly refusing to rent a home to parents because they have children. In the second action, HUD reached a settlement agreement with the owners of an apartment complex in Kihei, Hawaii to resolve allegations they barred families from living in certain buildings designated as ""adult friendly.""
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to deny housing because a family has children under the age of 18 and to make statements that discriminate against families with children. Similarly, ""adult-only"" housing violates the Fair Housing Act unless it qualifies as housing for older persons.
""It's impossible to overstate how important mothers are in the lives of their children, yet all too often, moms face unique forms of discrimination that unfairly limit their housing choices,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will continue to enforce the law when it comes to protecting the fair housing rights of families with children.""
The Nevada charge announced today stems from a complaint that was filed by the parents of three children alleging that the owner of a three-bedroom property refused to rent the home to them because they have children. Specifically, HUD's charge alleges that the mother contacted the owner in response to a newspaper classified ad in the Nevada Appeal which stated, ""3 or 5BD. 2 people preferred."" The owner asked the mother if there were one or two persons in her household. When the mother stated that she had several children, the owner allegedly told her that the home was not for her. HUD's charge further alleges that after the mother's conversation with the owner, she visited the newspaper's website and discovered the home was still advertised, but the ad had been changed to state the home was for ""one or two adults.""
Read HUD's charge against the Nevada property owners here.
In Kihei, Hawaii, HUD reached a Conciliation Agreement with the owners of a 200-unit apartment complex after a HUD Secretary-initiated investigation determined that two of the complex's 18 buildings are designated ""adult friendly."" HUD found the landlords did not permit families with children to live in these buildings and even required tenants to move out of them should they later have children. HUD's investigation also discovered an advertisement on Craigslist that stated ""Ground floor, adult only building..."" In addition, a fair housing tester who inquired about renting a unit was told that separate bedrooms are required for children of different sexes.
Under the agreement, the owners of the complex agree to stop excluding families with children from their properties, to abolish its policy of requiring children of different sexes to occupy different bedrooms, and to obtain fair housing training. Read HUD's agreement with the Hawaii property owners.
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages to the complainants for the harm caused them by the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose fines to vindicate the public interest. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages. Persons who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed at www.hud.gov/fairhousing or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, which can be accessed through Apple devices, such as the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch."
05/12/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-055.cfm,HUD Reaches Settlement with Pennsylvania Housing Authority,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today a Conciliation Agreement with the Housing Authority of the City of Hazleton, Pennsylvania, settling allegations the housing authority discriminated against Hispanic households. The agreement resolves claims the housing authority violated the housing rights of Spanish-speaking applicants andtenants by requiring them to supply interpreters in order to communicate with housing authority staff and by denying them limited English proficiency services. Read HUD's agreement with the Housing Authority of Hazleton.
The case came to HUD's attention when six Latino families represented by the Community Justice Project, a non-profit public interest law firm serving Pennsylvania, complained that the Hazleton Housing Authority subjected Latino applicants and residents to different rental terms and conditions in violation of the Fair Housing Act. In addition, the complaints alleged the housing authority denied limited English proficiency services to Spanish-speaking individuals in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI). The families who filed complaints are public housing and Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher recipients, tenants, and applicants for housing with limited English.
""When housing authorities accept HUD funding they are obligated to make their programs and services accessible to individuals who have limited English proficiency,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD is committed to ensuring that all eligible families have an equal opportunity to take advantage of this important source of affordable housing and today's agreement advances that goal.""
Under the terms of the agreement, the housing authority will provide the Community Justice Project with a monetary settlement of $14,000 that will be distributed among the residents who filed complaints, and $4,000 for attorney's fees. The housing authority will provide services for complainants and others with limited English proficiency, including interpretation and translation for persons who visit, write, or call the housing authority about housing or HUD's Housing Choice Voucher Program.
The housing authority must also hire bilingual Spanish-speaking staff. Housing authority employees must undergo fair housing and cultural sensitivity awareness training, and the housing authority will promote its language access services and the availability of housing to members of the Latino community when its wait list opens.In addition, the housing authority can no longer require applicants and residents to use family or friends as interpreters, including children under the age of 18.
Title VI prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin in programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance. Recipients of federal financial assistance, including housing authorities, must take reasonable steps to ensure that individuals with limited English proficiency have meaningful access to their programs. In addition, the Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to discriminate in the rental or sale of housing or to impose different terms and conditions on applicants and residents because of national origin, race, color, religion, sex, familial status or disability.
Persons who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY).

Read HUD's agreement with the Medina Metropolitan Housing Authority.
Title VI prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin in programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance. In addition, the Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to discriminate in the rental or sale of housing or to impose different terms and conditions based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status and disability.
""We're pleased we could reach this agreement with the Medina Housing Authority to address problems with their residency requirements,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will continue to work with housing providers, including housing authorities, to help them meet their obligation to comply with the nation's fair housing laws.""
The Medina Housing Authority had a residency preference point system that effectively imposed a residency requirement, thus putting African Americans who did not live or work in Medina County at a disadvantage.
Under the agreement, the housing authority will create a $35,000 relocation assistance fund, with payments of $500 per household, to support persons moving into Medina County with a Housing Choice voucher. The housing authority will also eliminate its residency preference, purge its waiting list, and provide voucher assistance on a first-come, first-served basis. In addition, the housing authority will market its voucher program to minorities who do not live or work in the county and develop a plan to increase access to its services by persons whose ability to read or write English is limited.
Persons who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY).

Read HUD's agreement with Anchorage.
The agreement is the result of a HUD complaint that was brought under the Fair Housing Act, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), all of which prohibit discrimination because of disability. Anchorage is subject to HUD's enforcement of all the laws because it receives federal financial assistance from HUD.
""Individuals with disabilities should have the same opportunity as others to live in neighborhoods they choose and should not be subjected to fees that others do not pay,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""We look forward to working with the municipality of Anchorage to make changes in its zoning ordinance to increase access for people with disabilities.""
In May 2014, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity filed a fair housing complaint alleging that Anchorage discriminated against persons with disabilities. The complaint alleged that the municipal code excluded certain housing for persons with disabilities from some residential districts, and required group homes for persons with disabilities to comply with extra procedures and pay fees that were not imposed on residences for persons who do not have disabilities.
Under the terms of the agreement, the municipality will retain a qualified independent consultant to review its municipal code regarding Assisted Living Facility and Rehabilitative Care uses, including any occupancy limits, administrative variance procedures and conditional use permit requirements. The consultant will advise the municipality on revisions to the code, and the municipality will repeal, amend or modify the code as necessary to be consistent with the Fair Housing Act and other federal civil rights law. The municipality will also refund up to $5,000 in permit fees to applicants for variances concerning housing for people with disabilities.

05/19/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-059.cfm,HUD Awards $29 Million to 25 Local HIV-AIDS Housing Programs,"WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced $29 million in grants to help approximately 1,200 extremely low-income persons and families living with HIV/AIDS annually. These grants provide a combination of housing assistance and supportive services for this vulnerable population.
In addition to housing assistance, these local programs will provide access to the needed supportive services such as case management, mental health, substance abuse, and employment training. The combination of housing assistance and supportive services are critical in sustaining housing stability, promoting better health outcomes, and increasing quality of life, which promotes self-sufficiency efforts for those able to transition to the private housing market (see attached chart and individual project descriptions below).
""Housing and health go hand in hand,"" said Secretary Julián Castro. ""These grants will provide our local partners with a critical resource to support low-income individuals and families living with HIV/AIDS. Having a stable place to live can make all the difference and we're proud to work with communities to help our fellow Americans in building productive and prosperous futures.""
The funding announced today is offered through HUD's Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS Program (HOPWA) and will renew HUD's support of 25 local programs in 16 states. Research shows that a stable home is critical to the health of persons with HIV-AIDS resulting in better health outcomes and reduced transmission of the disease.
The grants announced today also support Opening Doors (www.usich.gov/PDF/OpeningDoors_2010_FSPPreventEndHomeless.pdf), the Obama Administration's strategic plan to prevent and end homelessness, and the National HIV AIDS Strategy/ HIV Care Continuum, which identifies housing as a key component to reducing viral transmission. Housing assistance and related services funded by HOPWA are an essential part of the comprehensive system of care for low-income persons living with HIV/AIDS. A stable home environment is vital for these households to access consistent medical care and maintain their health. Furthermore, secure housing can be a platform for improved quality of life.
The HOPWA program is both a formula-based and a competitive grant program. Ninety percent of HOPWA funds are distributed by formula to cities and states based on the number of AIDS cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. HUD's formula grants are managed by 137 local and state jurisdictions, which coordinate AIDS housing efforts with other HUD and community resources. Overall, these resources assist more than 52,000 households annually to provide stable housing and reduced risks of homelessness for those living with HIV and other challenges. Ten percent of HOPWA funds are set aside to fund competitively awarded grants."

EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take two months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, 4 months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2%) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90-percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised about three percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found on our web site listed above.
* 90% confidence interval includes zero. The Census Bureau does not have sufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero.

The settlement requires Retirement Unlimited to pay $167,500 in damages. Read HUD's agreement with Retirement Unlimited.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities. This includes requiring persons with disabilities to pay additional security deposits or to buy liability insurance because they use motorized wheelchairs.
The case came to HUD's attention when two residents and Housing Opportunities Made Equal (HOME), a non-profit fair housing organization based in Richmond, Virginia, filed complaints alleging that Retirement Unlimited required residents who use motorized wheelchairs or scooters to pay a $1,500 security deposit, acquire a minimum of $100,000 in liability insurance, and sign an agreement stating that approval of the motorized wheelchairs could be withdrawn if payments to maintain the required insurance policies were not made.
After receiving the complaints, HUD conducted an investigation and found that the policies were applied at other properties and to other residents.
""Persons with disabilities may not be required to pay extra fees or obtain liability insurance because they use motorized wheelchairs,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""We're pleased that this company agrees to change its policies and practices so that it no longer discriminates against residents with disabilities.""
Under the terms of the agreement, Retirement Unlimited will pay a total of $107,500 to the complainants and other aggrieved individuals. In addition, Retirement Unlimited will donate $30,000 to HOME to support advocacy for individuals with disabilities, and donate an additional $30,000 to a HUD-approved organization that promotes education and assistance to persons with disabilities in Virginia. Retirement Unlimited will also adopt a revised ""Power Mobility Devices Policy"" for its six properties in Virginia that prohibits residents who use such devices from being charged extra security deposits or being subjected to other forms of discrimination, and provide training to its employees about the new policy.

(Associated) to resolve a disparate treatment redlining case, one of the largest redlining complaints brought by the federal government against a mortgage lender. At approximately $200 million, it is the largest settlement of this kind HUD has ever reached.
The settlement stems from a HUD Secretary-initiated complaint alleging that from 2008-2010, the Wisconsin-based bank engaged in discriminatory lending practices regarding the denial of mortgage loans to African-American and Hispanic applicants and the provision of loan services in neighborhoods with significant African-American or Hispanic populations. Read the agreement here.
""This settlement sends a strong message that HUD does not tolerate practices that unfairly restrict an equal and open housing market,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""Discriminatory lending practices have too often cut off too many credit-worthy families from the opportunities they need to thrive. This agreement will ensure that more Americans can fulfill their hopes and aspirations.""
Over the next three years, Associated will pay nearly $10 million in the form of lower interest rate home mortgages and down payment/closing cost assistance to qualified borrowers in majority-minority census tracts in the housing market areas of Chicago; Milwaukee; Minneapolis-St. Paul; Racine, Wisconsin; Kenosha, Wisconsin; and Lake County, Illinois.

Background
HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity filed a disparate treatment fair housing complaint alleging that between 2008 and 2010, Associated Bank discriminated on the basis of race and national origin regarding the denial of mortgage loans to qualified African-American and Hispanic applicants and the provision of loan services in majority-minority census tracts. HUD's analysis of Associated Bank's mortgage lending activity indicated that, compared to other mortgage lenders, Associated made few loans in majority-minority census tracts in five metropolitan areas in Illinois, Wisconsin, and Minnesota, but did make loans in nearby predominantly white tracts.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to discriminate in the terms, conditions, or privileges of sale of a dwelling because of race or national origin. The Act also makes it unlawful for any person or other entity whose business includes residential real estate-related transactions to discriminate against any person in making available such a transaction, or in the terms or conditions of such a transaction, because of race or national origin.
Persons who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed at www.hud.gov/fairhousing or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, which can be accessed through Apple devices, such as the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch."
06/01/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-065.cfm,HUD Seeking Public Comment on New Method to Expand Choice for Concentrated Voucher Families,"WASHINGTON - In some areas of the country, housing costs limit the ""choice"" for families receiving assistance from HUD's Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) Program to only a few neighborhoods. For the areas of the country where this problem is most severe, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is proposing a change to its rules that will expand the neighborhood options available to families.
Today, HUD is seeking public comment on changing the geography HUD uses to calculate rental limits in certain housing markets with highly variable rents as a means to expand the options these families have to live in lower poverty neighborhoods closer to better schools and higher paying jobs. Read HUD's Notice (www.huduser.org/portal/sites/default/files/pdf/SmallAreaFMR-AdvancedNotice.pdf).
HUD Secretary Julián Castro said, ""HUD's mission is to provide more opportunity and more choice for the families we help. We need to take a closer look at those neighborhoods where voucher-assisted families are concentrated and explore new ways to open more doors of opportunity.""
""Clearly, the yardstick we use to set voucher subsidies is limiting choice in many rental markets,"" said Kathy O'Regan, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research. ""We hope to stimulate a robust discussion over how HUD might use Fair Market Rents calculated at the zip code level so we can offer more choice in the Housing Choice Voucher Program.""
Background
Fair Market Rents (FMRs) are gross rent estimates that are used to calculate the maximum subsidy HUD provides families receiving rental assistance, including the 2.2 million households assisted through the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) Program. These households generally contribute 30 percent of their adjusted monthly income toward their rent with the rental subsidy paying the rest. FMRs are usually set at the 40th percentile of all rents charged in an entire metropolitan area although in 2000, HUD began to set this rent standard to the 50th percentile in areas where voucher families were highly concentrated within the FMR area.
The main objective of the 50th percentile program was to provide a broader range of housing choices that would enable voucher holders to move to areas of higher opportunity. However, research indicates that rather than incentivizing voucher holders to move to higher opportunity neighborhoods, most of the additional subsidies provided through 50th percentile FMRs appear to accrue to landlords in the form of higher rents. HUD is now exploring how to use FMRs calculated by zip codes within metropolitan areas as a mechanism to expand choices these households have.
Earlier this month, a group of Harvard University social scientists published a study based largely on HUD data. This report sought to measure the long-term effects of moving families away from neighborhoods with deeply concentrated poverty to low-poverty environments and to gauge the impact these moves had on the overall well-being of these families. The authors found that children who moved to low-poverty neighborhoods when they were young are doing better as adults, with significantly higher earnings and a greater likelihood of having attended college.
Findings from this new study, along with HUD's own research, support the Department's current policy direction of fostering opportunities for economic mobility while also investing in place-based strategies that revitalize distressed neighborhoods. Read more."
06/02/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-067.cfm,2015 HUD Secretary Design Award Winners Announced,"WASHINGTON - Two model affordable housing developments in California and Vermont are the recipients of the 2015 HUD Secretary's Housing and Community Design Award (www.huduser.org/portal/about/housingCommDesign_2015_1.html), each recognized for excellence in affordable housing design. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the American Institute of Architects (AIA) selected Step Up on 5th in Santa Monica, California; and Co-Op Plaza Redevelopment in Brattleboro, Vermont as national affordable housing models.
""Affordable housing represents a gateway to greater opportunity. These two projects are a powerful reminder that bold vision and innovative design can shape communities of promise,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""I congratulate these winners on their achievements and I'm proud to honor them for their commitment to inclusive development.""
The new HUD Secretary's Housing and Community Design Award recipients are:
Excellence in Affordable Housing Design Award - This award recognizes architecture that demonstrates overall excellence in terms of design in response to both the needs and constraints of affordable housing.
Step Up on 5th (www.aia.org/practicing/awards/2015/hud-awards/step-up/) Santa Monica, California. Brooks + Scarpa Architects
Step Up on 5th (Step Up) is a bright new spot in downtown Santa Monica. The new building provides a home, support services, and rehabilitation for the homeless and mentally disabled population, with 46 studio apartments of permanent affordable housing and ground level commercial/retail space and underground parking. Step Up incorporates energy efficient measures that exceed standard practice, optimize building performance, and reduce energy use during construction and occupancy. Planning and design of Step Up employed passive design strategies that make the building 50 percent more efficient than a conventionally designed structure.
In addition, the building is loaded with energy saving and environmentally benign devices. Materials conservation and recycling employed during construction, requiring that waste be hauled to a transfer station for recycling, achieved a 71 percent recycling rate. Carpet, insulation, and concrete with a recycled content and use of all natural linoleum flooring added to resource conservation. Throughout the building compact fluorescent lighting and double pane windows with a low-E coating are used. Each apartment is equipped with water-saving low flow toilets and a high-efficiency hydronic system for heat. While California has the most stringent energy efficiency requirements in the United States, Step Up incorporates numerous sustainable features that exceed state-mandated Title 24 energy measures by 26 percent. The project has followed the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification process making it equivalent to LEED Gold.
Custom water jet anodized aluminum panels on the main façade create a dramatic screen that sparkles in the sun and glows at night, while providing sun protection and privacy. The material reappears as a strategic arrangement of screens on east and south facing walls, contributing a subtle pattern to the exterior walkways and stairs. South facing walls filter direct sunlight with symmetrical horizontal openings that create a sense of security for the emotionally sensitive residents.
Creating Community Connection Award - This award recognizes projects that incorporate housing within other community amenities for the purpose of either revitalization or planned growth.
Co-op Plaza Redevelopment (www.aia.org/practicing/awards/2015/hud-awards/co-op-plaza/) Brattleboro, Vermont Gossens Bachman Architects
Co-op Plaza, a public-private partnership, is contributing to the revitalization of a key section of downtown Brattleboro. When the Brattleboro Food Co-op needed a major expansion the Co-op membership decided to forgo the easy and cheaper option to move to an outlying location and committed to staying downtown. As part of their mission, the members partnered with a local nonprofit to provide much needed affordable housing downtown. The first two floors of the new four-story building house the co-op grocery store and administrative offices, a bakery, and commercial space for local vendors. The extended roof on the first floor connects to an accessible green roof. The upper two floors are designed for 24 affordable apartments. The new parking areas, pedestrian walkways, outside seating, and café and market areas provide a sense of community and place for chance meetings.
The building is a model of energy efficiency, using both conventional and innovative systems, such as heating the entire building with reclaimed waste heat from the store refrigeration system. The collaborative design process was a critical factor in making the project a model for responsible building practice and smart growth. The site, previously contaminated by a dry cleaning facility, was cleaned up. The building was moved away from the nearby brook to protect the water from pollution and the building from flooding. Storm water runoff is treated and filtered by a green roof, permeable surfaces in the parking lot, and a 20-foot buffer strip in the new public park created along the Whetstone Brook.
Energy efficiency was achieved through active, passive, and innovative systems. Recycled heat generated by the Co-op's refrigerators heats the store and the apartments and provides hot water. The design includes natural light throughout and the use of louvers in the second-floor offices. Lighting is adjusted automatically with timers. Construction materials include locally harvested and milled flooring and slate siding manufactured in Vermont. The apartments have continuous fresh air ventilation with heat recovery and the Co-op uses a solar photovoltaic system to generate electricity. These features have cut per-square-foot energy costs by approximately 50 percent, which helps keep the apartments affordable and saves 21 tons of CO2 emissions a year.
The jury for the AIA/HUD Secretary Awards include: Stephen Schreiber, FAIA, (Chair) University of Massachusetts, Amherst; Claire Desjardins, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Jon Dick, AIA, Archaeo Architects; Kathy Dixon, AIA, K. Dixon Architecture; Clair Enlow, Freelance Writer; Jody Mcguire, AIA, SALA Architects and Madlyn Wohlman-Rodriguez, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development."
06/03/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-069.cfm,HUD Announces Agreement with North Miami Beach Condo Association Settling Claims of Discrimination Against Minority Residents,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced today an agreement with a North Miami Beach condominium association settling allegations its board president harassed and made discriminatory remarks about Black and Hispanic residents and attempted to evict them. Read HUD's Conciliation Agreement with Aqua Vista Townhomes Condominium Association.
""You can't deny people housing because of what they look like or where they come from,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""We have zero tolerance for those who discriminate against people because of their race or national origin.""
The settlement is the result of a complaint filed by HUD alleging the president of the condominium association's board of directors, Daniella Adams, engaged in a number of discriminatory actions against Black and Hispanic residents participating in the Housing Choice Voucher (Section 8) Program. HUD alleged Adams reported the tenants to Miami Dade Public Housing Agency for contrived Section 8 rules violations in an attempt to have them removed from the property. As a result of Adams' actions, several residents who were Section 8 voucher holders moved out of the complex.
Under the Conciliation Agreement, the condo association will establish a $109,000 compensation fund to pay damages to more than 20 residents and others harmed by Adams' alleged discriminatory actions, adopt an application policy that does not allow discrimination, and provide fair housing training for the association's board members, officers and employees.
The Fair Housing Act makes it illegal to refuse to rent or to make housing unavailable to any persons because of their race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status or disability. The Fair Housing Act also makes it unlawful to intimidate or interfere with any person's right to enjoy his or her home.
Persons who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to www.hud.gov/fairhousing, or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, which can be accessed through Apple devices, such as iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch, as well as Android devices."
06/04/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-068.cfm,HUD's Rebuild By Design Winner of 2015 Innovation Award,"WASHINGTON - Each year, the Administrative Conference of the United States (ACUS) bestows its Walter Gellhorn Innovation Award to a federal agency with the best model practice that can be adopted government-wide. Today, ACUS announced that the 2015 Walter Gellhorn Innovation Award is being presented to U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Rebuild by Design Competition.
Rebuild by Design was created in the summer of 2013 by President Obama's Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force as a way to develop ideas capable of dramatically improving the physical, ecological, and economic resilience of coastal areas. The competition produced regional, cross-disciplinary collaboration between state and local governments, the ten design teams, regional nonprofit organizations, educational institutions, and the public. The Rockefeller Foundation was the lead financial supporter of the competition. Teams worked to create coalitions with local and regional stakeholders to develop locally-responsive proposals to improve the resilience of waterfront communities.
""We're absolutely thrilled to receive this recognition on behalf of the many partners who came together to think of new ways to consider the challenge of how we prepare for natural disasters,"" said Harriet Tregoning, HUD's Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development. ""Rebuild by Design tapped into world-class talent to rethink how we might meet the inescapable challenges of climate change.""
The Rebuild by Design competition had a region-wide focus to help provide solutions to problems that are larger or more complex than individual towns have the capacity to solve themselves. The regional focus also helped provide a better understanding of the many interconnected systems (infrastructure, ecological, climate, economic and others) in the Sandy-affected region. Design teams first analyzed major regional vulnerabilities and then, through the collaborative design process, focused on local implementation and key projects for improving the region's resilience.
One year ago, HUD announced six winning design proposals from interdisciplinary teams representing some of the best planning, design, and engineering talent in the world. These inventive proposals are a blueprint for how coastal communities can maximize resilience as they rebuild and recover from major disasters. HUD chose the winners for their excellence in design and resilience and their engagement with local communities. These ideas will serve as a model for how States and local communities mitigate the effects of climate change and natural disasters in communities throughout the Sandy region, the United States, and the world. To support these design concepts, HUD awarded $920 million to New Jersey, New York, and New York City to assist with implementation of winning proposals. Read more about these winning designs."
06/04/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-070.cfm,HUD Launches New Website for Housing Counseling Agencies,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today unveiled a new website (www.hudhousingcounselors.com/) specifically designed for HUD-approved housing counseling agencies, offering free on-line training covering a broad range of topics including responsibilities of homeownership and tenancy; avoiding foreclosure and eviction; financial management; and fair housing.

06/12/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-072.cfm,HUD Charges Salt Lake City Property Owners with Discriminating Against Residents with Disabilities,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has charged the owners of a three-story Salt Lake City, Utah, apartment building with violating the Fair Housing Act by making housing unavailable to prospective residents with disabilities. Read HUD's charge.
""For more than 25 years, persons with disabilities have had the right to keep assistance animals that help them perform everyday activities,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD will continue to work with our fair housing partners to ensure that owners and landlords meet their obligation to provide reasonable accommodations when they are needed.""
The case came to HUD's attention when the Disability Law Center (DLC), a HUD Fair Housing Initiatives Program agency in Salt Lake City, filed a complaint after conducting fair housing tests. When a tester, posing as a prospective tenant whose husband uses an assistance animal, inquired about a unit that had been advertised on Craigslist, Sergey Krasovskiy allegedly refused to negotiate with her about the unit. Krasovskiy told the tester that he and his business partner ""usually don't accept animals."" The tester offered to provide a letter from her husband's doctor verifying the need for the service animal.
The charge further alleges that when the tester asked if the service animal would be acceptable, Krasovskiy repeatedly said that he would have to check with his business partner or stated that he was unable to reach his business partner. Twice Krasovskiy promised the tester that he would call her back but never did. Shortly after the tester's inquiries, Krasovskiy entered into two separate lease agreements with applicants who did not have disabilities.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities. This includes providing different terms and conditions to applicants with disabilities, refusing to make reasonable accommodations, and making housing unavailable to applicants with disabilities.
Discrimination based upon a person's disability status continues to be the most common basis of complaints filed with HUD and its partner agencies. Last year alone, this form of housing discrimination accounted for 4,606 complaints or 54 percent of all complaints filed with HUD. Read HUD's notice regarding service or companion animals.
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages to those harmed by the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose fines to vindicate the public interest. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages.
Persons who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to www.hud.gov/fairhousing, or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, which can be accessed through Apple devices, such as iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch, as well as Android devices."
06/12/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-073.cfm,FHA Expands Opportunities for Reverse Mortgage 'Non-Borrowing Spouses' to Remain in Their Home,"WASHINGTON - The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) today issued a revised policy under its Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) Program giving FHA-approved lenders expanded options to allow eligible 'non-borrowing spouses' the potential to remain in their home following the death of the last surviving borrower. Read FHA's new mortgagee letter.
Last year, FHA amended its HECM policies to allow for the deferral of foreclosure, or 'due and payable status' for certain Eligible Non-Borrowing Spouses for case numbers assigned on or after August 4, 2014. Today's action allows lenders to offer similar treatment for eligible HECMs and Eligible Non-Borrowing Spouses with FHA case numbers issued before August 4, 2014.
Under FHA's revised policy, lenders will be allowed to proceed with submitting claims on HECMs with Eligible Surviving Non-Borrowing Spouses and Case Numbers assigned before August 4, 2014 in accordance with the terms of the mortgagee letter by:
Electing to assign the HECM to HUD upon the death of the last surviving borrower, where the HECM would not otherwise be assignable to FHA solely as a result of the death of the borrower. (The Mortgagee Optional Election Assignment) Allowing claim payment following sale of the property by heirs or estate; or Foreclosing in accordance with the terms of the mortgage, and filing an insurance claim under the FHA insurance contract as endorsed.
• Electing to assign the HECM to HUD upon the death of the last surviving borrower, where the HECM would not otherwise be assignable to FHA solely as a result of the death of the borrower. (The Mortgagee Optional Election Assignment)
• Allowing claim payment following sale of the property by heirs or estate; or
• Foreclosing in accordance with the terms of the mortgage, and filing an insurance claim under the FHA insurance contract as endorsed.
By electing the Mortgagee Optional Election Assignment (MOE), lenders will be permitted assign an eligible HECM to HUD despite the death of the last surviving borrower and regardless of the loan's unpaid principal balance. Following the death of their borrowing spouse, non-borrowing spouses may remain in their home under the following conditions:
The lender or servicer agrees; The reverse mortgage was assigned an FHA case number prior to August 4, 2014; They are current in making timely tax and insurance payments; They maintain the property under the terms and conditions of the HECM; They were legally married to the borrowing spouse at the time of the loan closing, OR they were engaged in a committed same-sex relationship with the borrower akin to marriage but were prohibited under state law from legally marrying the borrower at the time of the loan's origination, but became legally married prior to the death of the borrower; They currently reside and resided in the property as his/her principal residence at the origination of the HECM and throughout the duration of the HECM borrower's life; They have, or are able to obtain, within 90 days following the last surviving borrower's death, good, marketable title to the property or a legal right to remain in the property for life; and
• The lender or servicer agrees;
• The reverse mortgage was assigned an FHA case number prior to August 4, 2014;
• They are current in making timely tax and insurance payments;
• They maintain the property under the terms and conditions of the HECM;
• They were legally married to the borrowing spouse at the time of the loan closing, OR they were engaged in a committed same-sex relationship with the borrower akin to marriage but were prohibited under state law from legally marrying the borrower at the time of the loan's origination, but became legally married prior to the death of the borrower;
• They currently reside and resided in the property as his/her principal residence at the origination of the HECM and throughout the duration of the HECM borrower's life;
• They have, or are able to obtain, within 90 days following the last surviving borrower's death, good, marketable title to the property or a legal right to remain in the property for life; and
They meet all other terms and conditions of the original mortgage contract."
06/15/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-074.cfm,HUD Awards Additional $6 Million in Housing Counseling Grants,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today awarded nearly $6 million in grants to hundreds of national, regional and local organizations to help families and individuals with their housing needs and to prevent future foreclosures. The grants announced today are in addition to $36 million awarded in April. See list of all counseling agencies awarded funding today.
Today's announcement includes nearly $1.5 million to new housing counseling grantees and $4.5 million to supplement the funding awarded in April to existing grantees. Read a comprehensive summary of each grant, organized by state.
""Whether you're a first-time buyer or trying to keep the place you've always called home, knowledge is the key to financial empowerment,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""We're proud to support our housing counseling partners as they help American families achieve stability and prosperity.""
Nearly $6 million will directly support the housing counseling services provided by 33 national and regional organizations, six multi-state organizations, 20 State Housing Finance Agencies (SHFAs) and 248 local housing counseling agencies.
The majority of the grants announced today were competed through the Department's two-year (FY2014 - FY2015) Comprehensive Housing Counseling Grant Program Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) published March 4, 2014. In addition, HUD offered additional grants to eligible new housing counseling agencies through a supplemental funding notice HUD published in April.
National and regional agencies distribute much of HUD's housing counseling grant funding to community-based organizations that assist low- and moderate-income families to improve their housing conditions. In addition, these larger organizations help improve the quality of housing counseling services and enhance coordination among counseling providers.
Recent research from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and the Urban Institute continues to find substantial benefits to housing counseling for families who purchase their first homes and those struggling to prevent foreclosure. Read more about research evidence on the role housing counseling can play in reducing mortgage delinquency and foreclosure and helping first-time buyers access and sustain homeownership.
Grant recipients utilize funding to address the full range of families' housing counseling needs. This includes helping homebuyers realistically evaluate their readiness for a home purchase, understand their financing and downpayment options, and navigate what can be an extremely confusing and difficult process. Grantees also help households find affordable rental housing and offer financial literacy training to individuals and families struggling to repair credit problems that restrict their housing options.
In addition to providing counseling to homeowners and renters, these organizations assist homeless persons in finding the transitional housing they need to move toward a permanent place to live. Finally, grantees also assist senior citizens seeking reverse mortgages or (HECM). These agencies provide counseling for the rapidly growing number of elderly homeowners who seek to convert equity in their homes into income that can be used to pay for home improvements, medical costs, and other living expenses.
Housing counseling agencies support fair housing by assisting borrowers in reviewing their loan documentation, to avoid potential mortgage scams, unreasonably high interest rates, inflated appraisals, unaffordable repayment terms, and other conditions that can result in a loss of equity, increased debt, default, and even foreclosure. Likewise, foreclosure prevention counseling helps homeowners facing delinquency or default employ strategies, including expense reduction, negotiation with lenders and loan servicers, and loss mitigation, to avoid foreclosure.

HUD's new guidance represents a set of clarifications and changes in response to operating experience since the program launch and stakeholder feedback; and incorporates key changes authorized by Congress, most notably to expand the program's scope from 60,000 to 185,000 units. Read HUD's notice.
Key revisions include:
Increasing the cap on public housing conversions from 60,000 to 185,000 units, representing approximately 15 percent of the public housing stock. Expanding the program's eligibility to include Moderate Rehabilitation Single Room Occupancy (Mod Rehab SRO) properties funded under the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act. It is estimated that approximately 400 SRO properties (including 14,000 units) will now be eligible to convert to either Project-Based Rental Assistance or Project-Based Vouchers, thereby allowing owners and investors greater opportunity to access debt and equity to make capital improvements. Strengthening key rights and protections for residents, including: Requiring owners/mangers to notify and consult with residents; Giving residents the a right to remain or return to the property; Prohibiting re-screening of current residents; Providing an option for a tenant-based voucher, if a resident chooses to leave the assisted property following conversion; and Continuing the essential rights and protections provided under the public housing program, including funding to support resident organizations. Offering Multi-family property owners participating in HUD's legacy Rent Supplement (Rent Supp) and Rental Assistance Payment (RAP)programs to participate fully in the RAD Program. There are approximately 106 properties (11,000 units) receiving direct rental assistance from HUD through the Rent Supp and RAP programs. Previously, units supported through these programs were permitted to convert only to the Project-Based Voucher Program. HUD will now allow owners of these properties to convert to the Project-Based Rental Assistance Program, an option that many of these owners find more attractive because of its familiarity to lenders and investors. Strengthening the requirement that PHAs maintain control of any new entity formed as part of a RAD conversion. The PHA must act as the managing general partner or hold a long-term ground lease on the property in order to have a controlling interest. The same affordability and ownership & control requirements must be maintained in the rare event of foreclosure, bankruptcy, or default under the contract. These requirements ensure that the public interest and the needs of tenants are protected in perpetuity.

While the increase in RAD's statutory cap allows significantly more public housing authorities to participate in this program, HUD anticipates demand to for the program to continue to grow. In establishing a public housing waiting list beyond the current conversion authority of 185,000 units, HUD will prioritize the conversion of public housing units with higher levels of investment and rehabilitation, while continuing to call for the elimination of the cap altogether and for funding for high-need properties in economically challenged areas in the FY '16 budget. HUD believes this is the best way to protect the public housing assets that are most in need of accessing additional preservation resources."
06/16/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-076.cfm,Housing Authorities Help Families Celebrate Father's Day,"WASHINGTON - As the nation prepares to celebrate Father's Day, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is encouraging communities to support dads living in HUD assisted housing to stay connected with their children. For the fifth consecutive year, hundreds of public housing authorities across the country are participating in HUD's National Father's Day Initiative by hosting events to celebrate fatherhood and family.
On behalf of HUD's National Father's Day 2015, other HUD assisted housing communities and potential partners have been invited to participate. Participants will also be invited to host a screening and discussion of ""RISE: The Promise of My Brother's Keeper,"" a documentary film about President Obama's initiative to address persistent opportunity gaps facing boys and young men of color and to ensure all young people reach their full potential. It will air on Discovery Channel on Sunday, June 21 at 7:00 PM ET/PT. See which housing authorities and HUD assisted housing communities are hosting events in your area.
To commemorate HUD's 50th anniversary this year, HUD Secretary Julián Castro is focused on advancing policies that create opportunities for all Americans, including using housing as a platform to improve the quality of life for public housing residents and their families.
""Strong families are the heart of strong communities. HUD is proud to work with our local partners to help parents and their children celebrate this meaningful time for our nation. The bond between each father and child is special, and we look forward to working with families as they continue to build a future full of love, opportunity, and prosperity,"" said HUD Secretary Castro. In order to use housing as a platform to improve the quality of life for families living in HUD assisted housing, HUD is committed to strengthening and empowering families through the use of service organizations throughout the country focusing on health, wealth, education, job training and corporate and government support.
While many local housing authorities and multifamily properties will use Saturday, June 20th - the day before Father's Day - to celebrate fatherhood and the importance of dads being connected with their children who live in public housing or surrounding communities, others will conduct activities throughout the month of June 2015. The events have a two-fold purpose: Offering activities for fathers and their children and connecting these men to economic development resources. Additionally, some housing authorities will link HUD's National Father's Day initiative with their science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) initiative to help low-income children who live in public housing get involved with STEM activities while spending time with their fathers.
Local offices of other federal agencies, including the U.S. Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services (HHS), Agriculture (USDA), Education and Justice are getting ready to offer on-site information and services such as employment resources, healthcare consultation and legal counseling this weekend.
HUD's Father's Day initiative is part of a larger Obama Administration effort to promote responsible fatherhood. The National Conversation on Responsible Fatherhood and Strong Communities (www.obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/administration/eop/ofbnp/policy/fatherhood) focuses on fatherhood and at-risk youth - a priority for the White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships.
Over 600 affordable housing communities in 39 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands will participate in HUD Father's Day 2015 and have partnered with other organizations including the Boys & Girls Club of America, Legal Services Corporation and the National Fatherhood Initiative (www.fatherhood.org/Page.aspx?pid=192). Created in 1994, NFI aims to raise awareness about the importance of having fathers present in their children's life. Together, these groups are delivering a clear message - America needs dads.
According to U.S. Census data, 24 million American children live in a home without a father. Also, NFI says children in homes absent a father are five times more likely to be poor; and are more likely to drop out of school or be incarcerated.
HUD's national Father's Day 2015 campaign is in part modeled after the New York City Housing Authority 2010 Fatherhood Initiative, which hosted a day-long event in all five of its boroughs to kick off ongoing economic development, parenting workshops, tutoring and bonding activities for fathers and children.

06/16/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-077.cfm,HUD and Census Bureau Announce New Residential Construction Activity in May,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Census Bureau jointly announced the following new residential construction statistics for May 2015:
BUILDING PERMITS
Privately owned housing units authorized by building permits in May were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,275,000. This is 11.8 percent (±1.8%) above the revised April rate of 1,140,000, and is 25.4 percent (±2.1%) above the May 2014 estimate of 1,017,000. Single-family authorizations in May were at a rate of 683,000; this is 2.6 percent (±1.2%) above the revised April figure of 666,000. Authorizations of units in buildings with five units or more were at a rate of 557,000 in May.
HOUSING STARTS
Privately owned housing starts in May were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,036,000. This is 11.1 percent (±10.4%)* below the revised April estimate of 1,165,000 and is 5.1 percent (±11.2%)* above the May 2014 rate of 986,000. Single-family housing starts in May were at a rate of 680,000; this is 5.4 percent (±7.0%)* below the revised April figure of 719,000.

New Residential Construction data for June 2015 will be released on Friday, July 17, 2015, at 8:30 A.M. EDT.
EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take two months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, 4 months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2%) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90-percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised about three percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found on our web site listed above.
* 90% confidence interval includes zero. The Census Bureau does not have sufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero.

06/18/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-078.cfm,FHA Proposes Clearer Rules for Lenders with Updated Defect Taxonomy,"WASHINGTON - Today, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) posted its Single Family Loan Quality Assessment Methodology or ""Defect Taxonomy"", which explains how FHA intends to categorize loan defects found in Single Family FHA endorsed loans. The framework, part of the ""Blueprint for Access,"" centers on three core concepts: identifying a defect, capturing the sources and causes of a defect and assessing the severity of a defect. The taxonomy is part of FHA's effort to provide greater clarity and transparency to Single Family FHA approved lenders to encourage lending to qualified borrowers across the credit spectrum.
For the past year, FHA has been working on a series of changes aimed at enhancing its quality assurance process. The new taxonomy will complement the updated certification language FHA has released and FHA's new Handbook, the first section of which becomes effective in September, creating a stronger quality assurance program. The increased clarity with respect to quality assurance measures enhances access for potential borrowers because lenders can originate loans confidently-knowing their mortgages meet FHA standards. By enhancing the way FHA provides policy direction and monitors lender compliance and performance, the FHA insurance fund, borrowers, lenders and taxpayers will be better protected.
""This new guidance gives lenders greater insight into how FHA will capture defects and their relative severities,"" said Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Housing, Edward Golding. ""By enhancing our approach, lenders will have more confidence in how they interact with FHA, and we anticipate will be more willing to lend to future homeowners who are ready to own.""
Currently, Single Family FHA uses 99 different codes to describe defects in loans. The taxonomy, once implemented, will bring this down to nine distinct defects, supported by codes that will identify the source and cause of the defect, and offer some new insight into the significance of a given deficiency within each category. This new approach will give lenders additional information that helps identify where their challenges are in originating FHA loans and allow them to make changes to reduce errors that potentially trigger enforcement actions. The taxonomy will also allow FHA to monitor trends in deficiencies and determine if policies can be enhanced to help lenders better comply with FHA standards.
The nine defect categories under the new taxonomy are:
Borrower Income (BI) Borrower credit / liabilities (BC) Loan to value and max mortgage amount (LM) Borrower Assets (BA) Property eligibility (PE) Property appraisal (PA) Borrower eligibility and qualification (BE) Mortgage eligibility (ME) Lender operations (LO)
• Borrower Income (BI)
• Borrower credit / liabilities (BC)
• Loan to value and max mortgage amount (LM)
• Borrower Assets (BA)
• Property eligibility (PE)
• Property appraisal (PA)
• Borrower eligibility and qualification (BE)
• Mortgage eligibility (ME)
• Lender operations (LO)
Currently, FHA's approach to quality assurance consists of defect codes that focus on distinct causes, with findings for each defect classified as being either Unacceptable or Deficient. Moreover, much of the detail of the sources and causes of defects was only captured in loan reviewers' notes and thus, unable to be aggregated.
With the intended taxonomy, FHA's approach to quality assurance will evolve. Under the new guidance, quality assurance will consist of a limited number of defects organized within each of the above-referenced nine categories. Defects will then be supported by more detailed categorization of the sources and causes of a defect and assigned to one of four tiers indicating the severity of the defect. Together these changes will create a more transparent and informative structure.
This Taxonomy is not a comprehensive statement on all compliance monitoring or enforcement efforts by FHA or the Federal Government and does not establish standards for administrative or civil enforcement action, which are set forth in separate law. Nor does it address FHA's response to patterns and practice of loan-level defects, or FHA's plans to address fraud or misrepresentation in connection with any FHA-insured loan.
An effective date for the Defect Taxonomy has not been set at this time. Posting the information now provides insight to lenders on the future approach that Single Family FHA will be adopting. This allows time for lenders to consider any changes or updates they may want to make to their internal quality control processes as a result."
06/22/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-079.cfm,HUD Selects Finalists for National Disaster Resilience Competition,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro announced today that 40 states and local communities will compete in the second and final phase of HUD's National Disaster Resilience Competition (NDRC). Aligned closely with a companion education and technical assistance effort by the Rockefeller Foundation, HUD's competition is designed to help states and local communities recover from past disasters while improving their ability to withstand future extreme events through strategic community investments.
In Phase 2, each finalist is invited to propose specific projects that advance their community's comprehensive resilience plans, as envisioned in Phase 1. Selected projects will be funded from a total pool of nearly $1 billion. $181 million is set aside for projects in New York and New Jersey. The maximum grant award available at the end of Phase 2 will be $500 million and the minimum will be $1 million.
The National Disaster Resilience Competition finalists are:
""HUD is committed to helping communities meet the realities of climate change and extreme weather,"" said HUD Secretary Castro. ""We're proud to partner with the Rockefeller Foundation in supporting American families as they recover from natural disasters and prepare for the challenges of tomorrow. Together, we can build a nation that's stronger and more resilient than ever.""
""Catastrophic events are becoming more common place, and crisis is the new normal. This is why it is critical for communities, large and small, to place a premium on building resilience. They can be prepared for whatever comes their way, and disruptions won't become disasters,"" said Dr. Judith Rodin, President of The Rockefeller Foundation. ""Resilience is a journey, not a destination, and the time to build resilience is now, through a focus on strengthening social cohesion and making smart plans for communities through collaboration across sectors, so that investments - particularly in infrastructure - will yield multiple benefits, or what I call a resilience dividend. The NDRC finalists share this vision, and I am eager to learn more in the coming months about their innovative ideas inspired through the competition.""
NATIONAL DISASTER RESILIENCE COMPETITION
HUD's National Disaster Resilience Competition makes $1 billion available to communities that have been struck by natural disasters in recent years. The competition promotes risk assessment, stakeholder engagement, and planning and will fund the implementation of innovative resilience projects to better prepare communities for future storms and other extreme events. Funding for the competition is from the Community Development Block Grant-Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) appropriation provided by the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013 (PL 113-2), which made emergency funds available for Hurricane Sandy and other Presidentially declared major disasters occurring in 2011-2013. This competition responds to requests from state and local leaders who asked the federal government to help them prepare their communities for the impacts of climate change and support investments in more resilient infrastructure. HUD expects that the final awards will not only help better protect residents from future threats in those affected areas, but will help to lead the way for all American communities to make better and more thoughtful investments in resilience.
The National Climate Assessment (http://nca2014.globalchange.gov/) recognizes that extreme weather events-including heat waves, drought, tropical storms, high winds, storm surges and heavy downpours-are becoming more severe. In many places, these risks are projected to increase substantially due to rising sea levels and evolving development patterns, causing risks to the safety, health, and economies of entire communities. Events like Hurricane Sandy have made it clear that coastal communities in particular remain vulnerable to such events despite advances in disaster preparedness. American communities cannot effectively reduce their risks and vulnerabilities without planning for future extreme events and other impacts of climate change both in their disaster recovery phase, and in their everyday decision-making.
The deadline for Phase 2 applications will be October 27, 2015. All successful applicants will be required to tie their proposals back to the eligible disaster from which they are recovering. For example, a community that suffered a flood might want to offer buyouts to property owners in the most impacted and distressed areas, coupled with restoration of a wetland to limit future flooding and provide a nature preserve or recreation area. A community that lost housing and a road during a mudslide might want to construct housing in safer areas for survivors, while also making infrastructure investments that support a more diverse and vibrant economy to help impacted businesses recover from the effects of the last event and bounce back more quickly from future hazards. HUD will announce the winners of Phase 2 in early 2016.
Partnership with Rockefeller Foundation
The Rockefeller Foundation renewed its commitment to work closely with HUD to encourage and support a culture of resilience around disaster preparedness and planning in American communities. As it did in Phase 1 of the NDRC competitions, the Rockefeller Foundation will provide targeted technical assistance to eligible states and communities and support a stakeholder-driven process, informed by the best available data, to identify recovery needs and innovative solutions. The strategic partnership between the Rockefeller Foundation and HUD draws on the best of the Rebuild by Design competition, where the Rockefeller Foundation provided lead support for administration of the competition and community engagement. Rebuild by Design competition produced six winning projects announced in June 2014 to be implemented with $930 million from HUD. These projects serve as models of how philanthropic resources and federal funding can be leveraged to support the design of innovative resilience projects which not only protect people and property from future disasters but also provide highly desirable community amenities like parks and recreation areas. Rebuild by Design encouraged communities to use both traditional ""gray"" and green infrastructure solutions to recurrent flooding, spurring best thinking to move beyond traditional sea walls to more attractive and sustainable solutions.
Objectives
The Competition seeks to meet the following six objectives:
• Fairly and effectively allocate $1 billion in CDBG-DR funds.
• Create multiple examples of modern disaster recovery that apply science-based and forward-looking risk analysis to address recovery, resilience, and revitalization needs.
• Leave a legacy of institutionalizing-in as many states and local jurisdictions as possible-the implementation of thoughtful, sound, and resilient approaches to addressing future risks.
• Provide resources to help communities plan and implement disaster recovery that makes them more resilient to future extreme weather events or other shocks, while also improving quality of life for existing residents.
• Fully engage community stakeholders to inform them about the impacts of climate change and develop pathways to resilience based on sound science.
• Leverage investments from the philanthropic community to help communities define problems, set policy goals, explore options, and craft solutions to inform their own local and regional resilient recovery strategies.

06/23/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-080.cfm,HUD and Census Bureau Report New Residential Sales in May,"WASHINGTON - Sales of new single-family houses in May 2015 were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 546,000, according to estimates released jointly today by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Census Bureau. This is 2.2 percent (±16.7%)* above the revised April rate of 534,000 and is 19.5 percent (±19.7%) above the May 2014 estimate of 457,000.
The median sales price of new houses sold in May 2015 was $282,000; the average sales price was $337,000. The seasonally adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of May was 206,000. This represents a supply of 4.5 months at the current sales rate.
Estimates of houses sold and for sale by stage of construction are now available on a seasonally adjusted basis as well as not seasonally adjusted basis. Historic seasonally adjusted data will be available back to January 1999 at http://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/historical_data/.

06/25/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-081.cfm,Deaf and Those Who Use Wheelchairs Face Added Discrimination in Rental Housing Market,"WASHINGTON - Well-qualified homeseekers who are deaf or hard of hearing, as well as homeseekers who use wheelchairs, are told about fewer available housing units than comparable homeseekers who can hear and walk, according to a new study released today by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Urban Institute. Discrimination in the Rental Housing Market Against People Who Are Deaf and People Who Use Wheelchairs (www.huduser.org/portal/publications/fairhsg/hds_disability.html) finds that people who are deaf or who use wheelchairs are at a statistically significant disadvantage when it comes to the number of homes they are informed about.
""Every American deserves the opportunity to secure a home,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""But the evidence is clear: people who are hearing-impaired or in wheelchairs face unacceptable and unjust discrimination. HUD will continue to work with our fair housing partners to protect the rights of Americans with disabilities and to promote opportunity for all.""
Key findings of the report include:
Discrimination against people who are deaf or hard of hearing
When well-qualified homeseekers who are deaf or hard of hearing contact housing providers and use assistive communication technologies to inquire about recently advertised rental housing, providers are less likely to respond to their inquiries. The extent of apparent discrimination against people who are deaf or hard of hearing varies with the type of communication technology the deaf or hard of hearing tester uses to make contact with housing providers. Housing providers are more resistant to dealing with the older (but still widely used) telephone technologies which have longer communication delays. When they do respond, the housing providers tell homeseekers who are deaf or hard of hearing about fewer available housing options than they tell comparable homeseekers who are hearing.

• When they do respond, the housing providers tell homeseekers who are deaf or hard of hearing about fewer available housing options than they tell comparable homeseekers who are hearing.
Discrimination against people who use wheelchairs
Well-qualified homeseekers who use wheelchairs are more likely to be denied an appointment to view recently advertised rental housing in buildings with accessible units than comparably qualified homeseekers who are ambulatory. Those who do receive an appointment are less likely than their ambulatory counterparts to be told about and shown suitable housing units. When homeseekers who use a wheelchair ask about modifications that would make the available housing more accessible to them, housing providers agree in most instances. However in approximately a quarter of the requests, housing providers either failed to provide a clear response or explicitly denied modification requests.

However in approximately a quarter of the requests, housing providers either failed to provide a clear response or explicitly denied modification requests.
The Urban Institute, which conducted the study, employed a ""paired testing"" methodology in which researchers compared the treatment of persons who are deaf or hard of hearing, and those who are wheelchair bound, against those who can hear and not wheelchair bound. The paired testing track for people who were deaf or hard of hearing included 1,665 remote telephone tests conducted in a national sample of 168 metropolitan areas that contained more than four-fifths (82%)of the population that is deaf or hard of hearing and that resides in rental housing. The national sample for people who use wheelchairs included 1,259 tests in 30 metropolitan areas containing almost three-quarters (73%) of the population that has a mobility disability and that resides in rental housing.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities. Discrimination complaints made on the basis of physical and mental disabilities have increased over time to become the largest share of complaints received by federal and local agencies and private fair housing organizations. In FY 2014, disability was the most common basis of complaints filed with HUD and its partner agencies, being cited as a basis for 4,606 complaints, or 54 percent of the overall total.
Persons who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to www.hud.gov/fairhousing, or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, whichcan be accessed through Apple devices, such as iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch, as well as Android devices."
07/06/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-082.cfm,FHA Proposes Deadline for Lenders to File Claims,"WASHINGTON - The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) is proposing to establish a maximum time period for lenders to file insurance claims and to revise its policy on reimbursement of eligible expenses and debenture interest when foreclosure and claim filing deadlines are missed. Read FHA's proposed rule (www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2015-07-06/pdf/2015-16479.pdf).
Since the economic downturn in the housing market, many servicers delayed filing claims for insurance benefits, opting to wait and file large numbers of claims with FHA at the same time. The costs associated with delayed claim filing and the large number of claims filed simultaneously strain FHA resources.
FHA's proposal would require lenders to submit claims three months from the point at which they obtain marketable title to the property or successfully sell the property to a third party. This new deadline will ensure FHA can effectively manage and process timely claims.
FHA's proposal would also eliminate the requirement that lenders/servicers forfeit reimbursement for eligible expenses and debenture interest after missing a foreclosure or claim filing deadline. Lenders/servicers now will receive this reimbursement, subject to a deduction based on the number of days the foreclosure or claim filing deadline was past due. This reimbursement calculation will allow lenders/servicers to recover amounts they normally would have lost while mitigating the cost to FHA associated with missed deadlines.
FHA's proposed rule will be open for public comment for 60 days."
07/07/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-083.cfm,New HUD Report Finds Homeless Families Offered Vouchers Fare Better Than Families Provided Other Assistance,"WASHINGTON - Each year, it's estimated that more than 150,000 families experience homelessness and are forced to seek emergency shelter for themselves and their children[1]. Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) published the short-term results of a study designed to examine how homeless families in emergency shelter responded to various interventions designed to help them exit homelessness. HUD's Family Options Study (www.huduser.org/portal/publications/affhsg/family_options_study.html) found that 18 months after enrolling into the study and being randomly assigned to one of four interventions, the families offered a housing voucher experienced significantly better outcomes than those families randomly assigned to any of the three other options.
HUD discovered that families offered a Housing Choice Voucherwere less likely to reenter homelessness or experience housing instability, and experienced reduced school mobility for their children. When compared to families who elected to remain in emergency shelter, families offered a voucher also experienced significant reductions in child separations from parents; adult psychological distress; domestic violence; and food insecurity. HUD also found that the costs of the voucher were comparable to or substantially less than the other interventions over the course of the follow-up period.
""The results of this study demonstrate the wide-ranging benefits of supporting families experiencing homelessness with stable and enduring rental assistance—such as the assistance provided through our Housing Choice Voucher Program,"" said Kathy O'Regan, HUD's Assistant Secretary of Policy Development and Research. ""We will continue to study the efficacy of these interventions to see if the longer term outcomes mirror those we see in the short term.""
HUD will host a briefing to present the report's findings at 1 p.m. EDT on Wednesday, July 8th. This briefing will be webcast live, and will be available to access on HUD's website (www.huduser.org/family-options-study-event/index.html). Following this briefing, the briefing will be available on HUD's YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/user/HUDchannel).
Methodology
Over an 18-month period (between September of 2010 and January 2012), a total of 2,282 homeless families (including more than 5,000 children) enrolled into the study from emergency shelters in 12 communities nationwide:
• Alameda County, California;
• Atlanta;
• Baltimore;
• Boston;
• New Haven and Bridgeport regions, Connecticut;
• Denver;
• Honolulu;
• Kansas City, Missouri;
• Louisville, Kentucky;
• Minneapolis;
• Phoenix; and
• Salt Lake City.
These families were randomly assigned to one of four interventions:
• Permanent housing subsidy, usually a Housing Choice Voucher, which could include help finding housing but no other supportive services.
• Community-based rapid re-housing, which provides temporary rental assistance, potentially renewable for up to 18 months, paired with limited, housing-focused services to help families find and rent conventional, private-market housing.
• Project-based transitional housing, whichprovides temporary housing for up to 24 months in agency-controlled buildings or apartment units paired with intensive supportive services.
• Usual care, which is defined as any housing or services that a family accesses in the absence of immediate referral to the other interventions. Typically, this includes at least some additional stay in the emergency shelter from which families were enrolled.
Random assignment provided families with a direct referral to one of four different interventions—but families were not required to accept this referral and were free to pursue alternate arrangements. HUD measured outcomes for families in five domains: housing stability, family preservation, adult well-being, child well-bring, and self-sufficiency, and compared the outcomes of families assigned to each of the four interventions. Extensive data has been collected from the head of household, as well as from children directly, through surveys or direct child/parent observation in the home. Impacts shared in this new report document the outcomes of families roughly 18 months after random assignment, but HUD is continuing to follow the families for at least three years and will report on the 36 month outcomes in 2017.
Major Findings: 18-Months Later
Families offered a Housing Choice Voucher experienced significantly less homelessness and housing instability than families offered any of the other interventions.
• Families offered a Housing Choice Voucher experienced significantly less homelessness and housing instability than families offered any of the other interventions.
When compared to families assigned to usual care, families offered a Housing Choice Voucher experienced significant reductions in subsequent homelessness; housing and school mobility; child separations from parents; adult psychological distress; domestic violence; and food insecurity.
• When compared to families assigned to usual care, families offered a Housing Choice Voucher experienced significant reductions in subsequent homelessness; housing and school mobility; child separations from parents; adult psychological distress; domestic violence; and food insecurity.
The total costs incurred by families assigned to the Housing Choice Voucher intervention were comparable to the costs incurred by families assigned to usual care, slightly higher than the costs of families assigned to community-based rapid re-housing, and substantially lower than the costs of families assigned to project-based transitional housing.
• The total costs incurred by families assigned to the Housing Choice Voucher intervention were comparable to the costs incurred by families assigned to usual care, slightly higher than the costs of families assigned to community-based rapid re-housing, and substantially lower than the costs of families assigned to project-based transitional housing.
Families randomly assigned to community-based rapid re-housing experienced similar outcomes to those families who were assigned to usual care, achieving no statistically significant reductions in subsequent emergency shelter use or housing mobility.
• Families randomly assigned to community-based rapid re-housing experienced similar outcomes to those families who were assigned to usual care, achieving no statistically significant reductions in subsequent emergency shelter use or housing mobility.
Families randomly assigned to project-based transitional housing with intensive support services experienced reductions in emergency shelter use relative to families assigned to usual care, but achieved no better non-housing outcomes.
• Families randomly assigned to project-based transitional housing with intensive support services experienced reductions in emergency shelter use relative to families assigned to usual care, but achieved no better non-housing outcomes.
Emergency shelter programs had the highest average per-family monthly costs of approximately $4,800, compared to transitional housing at $2,700, a voucher at $1,160 per month, and rapid re-housing at $880 per month.
• Emergency shelter programs had the highest average per-family monthly costs of approximately $4,800, compared to transitional housing at $2,700, a voucher at $1,160 per month, and rapid re-housing at $880 per month.
Policy Implications
On a single night in January 2014, volunteers across the country counted more than 216,000 people in just over 68,000 families who were experiencing homelessness in shelters or on the streets, representing 37 percent of all homeless persons.[2] Opening Doors: The Federal Strategy Plan to End Homelessness (http://usich.gov/resources/uploads/asset_library/FactSheetFamilieswithChildren.pdf) establishes an ambitious goal to prevent and end homelessness among children, families and youth by 2020. Until now, there has been little empirical evidence comparing outcomes among various interventions designed to address homelessness among families to guide policy and decision makers.
HUD's 18-month evaluation findings offer striking evidence that offering homeless families a voucher yields measurably better outcomes at similar or even lower costs than the other interventions. Due to recent evidence documenting the high costs of transitional housing, HUD has encouraged local communities to review, and likely reduce, the number of transitional housing beds they support. Findings from HUD's Family Options Studywill likely continue the Department's effort to press state and local planners to target their limited resources to those strategies that demonstrate the best outcomes for families and their children.

07/08/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-084.cfm,HUD Announces Final Rule on Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced a final rule today to equip communities that receive HUD funding with data and tools to help them meet long-standing fair housing obligations in their use of HUD funds. HUD will also provide additional guidance and technical assistance to facilitate local decision-making on fair housing priorities and goals for affordable housing and community development.
For more than forty years, HUD funding recipients have been obligated by law to reduce barriers to fair housing, so everyone can access affordable, quality housing. Established in the Fair Housing Act of 1968, the law directs HUD and its program participants to promote fair housing and equal opportunity. This obligation was intended to ensure that every person in America has the right to fair housing, regardless of their race, color, national origin, religion, sex, disability or familial status. The final rule aims to provide all HUD program participants with clear guidelines and data they can use to achieve those goals.
""As a former mayor, I know firsthand that strong communities are vital to the well-being and prosperity of families,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""Unfortunately, too many Americans find their dreams limited by where they come from, and a ZIP code should never determine a child's future. This important step will give local leaders the tools they need to provide all Americans with access to safe, affordable housing in communities that are rich with opportunity.""
HUD's final rule responds to the recommendations of a 2010 Government Accountability Office reportas well as stakeholders and HUD program participants who asked for clearer guidance, more technical assistance, better compliance and more meaningful outcomes. HUD considered and incorporated feedback from the significant public input and comments that it received during the development of this final rule. For example, in response to public feedback, HUD will phase in implementation of the rule so that grantees have substantial time to transition to the new approach. By encouraginga balanced approach that includes targeted investments in revitalizing areas, as well as increased housing choice in areas of opportunity, the rule will enable program participants to promote access to community assets such as quality education, employment, and transportation.
HUD's rule clarifies and simplifies existing fair housing obligations and creates a streamlined Assessment of Fair Housing planning process, which will help communities analyze challenges to fair housing choice and establish their own goals and priorities to address the fair housing barriers in their community. While the final rule will take effect 30 days after publication, it will not be fully implemented immediately. HUD will provide support to program participants that need to complete an Assessment of Fair Housing to ensure they understand the process and to identify best practices across a diverse group of communities.

07/09/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-085.cfm,What They're Saying: Leaders Nationwide Praise HUD's Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing Action,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) yesterday announced a final Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing rule to equip communities that receive HUD funding with data and tools to help them meet long-standing fair housing obligations in their use of HUD funds. This obligation was intended to ensure that every person in America has the right to fair housing, regardless of their race, color, national origin, religion, sex, disability or familial status. The final rule aims to provide all HUD program participants with clear guidelines and data they can use to achieve those goals.
Leaders in city government, the U.S. Congress, think tanks, civil rights organizations, fair housing organizations, housing groups, regional councils, and academic institutions have quickly offered their support of this announcement.
What leaders are saying about HUD's fair housing action:
New York City Mayor Bill deBlasio: ""We commend Secretary Castro and the entire HUD team's efforts to develop regulations designed to help housing and community development agencies across the United States better achieve our shared goals of overcoming historic patterns of residential segregation and using our housing and community development investments to reduce inequality, rebuild neighborhoods burdened with concentrated poverty, and provide families with access to opportunities that will serve as stepping stones to better lives for them and their children.""
House Financial Services Committee Ranking Member Maxine Waters: ""The Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing provision of the Fair Housing Act was intended to help remedy years of government-supported segregation and inequality, not by forcing diversity, but by empowering and encouraging states and localities to partner with the federal government to address the effects of these harmful policies. I am particularly pleased that HUD has addressed a concern I raised by making several changes in the final rule to make clear that investment in areas of racially and ethnically concentrated poverty is a strategy that falls within the purpose and definition of AFFH. In doing so, HUD has explicitly recognized the importance of place-based strategies in local efforts to expand housing opportunities, as well as the need for balanced consideration when it comes to strategic investment.""
Austin Mayor Steve Adler: ""Today's announcement of new rules to combat segregation in federally subsidized housing from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development is commendable. Local communities will have additional tools to increase transparency, accountability, and effectiveness. These rule changes will help us design and develop ways to provide more access and opportunity to affordable housing, while supporting our efforts to combat poverty and segregation. We appreciate the efforts of HUD and the leadership of Secretary Castro.""
Minnesota Congressman Keith Ellison: ""The final Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing rule moves our nation towards real solutions and creates communities of opportunity for all Americans. HUD's action today will make it a little easier for families with children, African Americans, Latinos, Native Americans, Asian American Pacific Islanders, new Americans, people with disabilities and other under-served Americans to make ends meet.""
Houston Mayor Annise Parker : ""We support the balanced approach the new rule takes toward affirmatively furthering fair housing. The City of Houston has been actively using targeted revitalization and community engagement to transform areas of poverty into areas of opportunity, while preserving affordable housing choices for our residents. We applaud Secretary Castro and HUD for developing a rule that acknowledges the unique and varied needs of our nation's cities and provides multiple avenues for achieving the goals of the Fair Housing Act""
Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, where AFFH announcement was made: ""We have a long history as it relates to fair housing. I think this is the perfect place not just because of the history of Chicago but because of the future we are building today.""
Cashauna Hill, Executive Director of The Greater New Orleans Fair Housing Action Center: ""All too often, where we live determines our access to opportunities. The issuance of this rule provides crucial guidance in ensuring that the City of New Orleans and other local governments can achieve the vision of the Fair Housing Act.""
Brad Howard, spokesman for New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu: ""Mayor Landrieu has long advocated for policies that create more inclusive communities, increase housing choices for all residents and reduce disparities in life outcomes created by poor housing conditions. We are pleased that President Obama and Secretary Castro are providing communities with data and tools designed to help ensure more Americans have equal access to opportunity no matter where they grow up. No child's dreams should be out of reach simply because of his or her zip code. Though challenges remain, New Orleans has already made great progress in developing mixed-income, mixed-use affordable housing opportunities that bring communities together, and we hope these new resources will help realize even more progress as we head into 2018.""
King County Executive Dow Constantine (Washington State): ""These new federal regulations will let communities better understand the devastating impact of historic patterns of discrimination and segregation on our country. Secretary Castro is giving us innovative tools and resources to accelerate the work we're doing in our region, increasing access to opportunity and ensuring that a person's ability to thrive is not dictated by his or her ZIP code.""
Sacramento Mayor Kevin Johnson: ""Our goal is to be inclusive, our goal is to create equal access to opportunity and that's exactly what this goal that HUD's new rule of Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing is all about. HUD's new assessment of fair housing tool helps local leaders visualize where opportunity is and where opportunity isn't and it helps local leaders craft data driven solutions and to invest where it matters most in our cities.""
Minneapolis Mayor Betsy Hodges: ""The increased focus on fair housing is in line with the priorities of [my] office and the city and that it provides ‘the new tools we need to help combat the housing disparities we have long struggled to overcome.'""
Brownsville, TX Mayor Tony Martinez: ""Here in the City of Brownsville, we're all about breaking down barriers, and this announcement will bring us that much closer to reaching our goal. We support Secretary Castro and HUD in their efforts to tackle housing segregation; this is an important advancement for communities everywhere. We look forward to working with our partners, acquiring stronger tools, and gaining the technical assistance needed to break down barriers to fair housing.""
Janet Murguía, President and CEO of NCLR: ""For Latino families, who are among the most vulnerable to fair housing violations, strong regulations that combat systemic discrimination are essential to expanding opportunities and promoting healthier, safer and more diverse communities. Persistent segregation in communities often prevents low-income people and people of color from accessing quality schools, transportation and jobs. This strong rule from HUD will help address the growing racial and ethnic inequalities in this country by ensuring that all people, regardless of race, ethnicity, family status or disability, may choose where they want to live.""
NAACP Legal Defense & Educational Fund, Inc. (LDF): ""HUD's rule could not come at a more critical time. The affirmative obligation imposed by the Fair Housing Act on local governments is perhaps the strongest tool we have to counter entrenched patterns of residential segregation that limit access to opportunity. Housing is the linchpin to quality schools, good jobs, accessible transportation and safe neighborhoods. This rule is a much needed jump-start for localities to address the myriad forces that restrict access to opportunity and to build more inclusive communities where everyone may thrive.""
President of the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund: ""Housing discrimination is the unfinished business of civil rights. It goes right to the heart of our divide from one another. It goes right to the heart of whether you believe that African American people's lives matter, that you respect them, that you believe they can be your neighbors, that you want them to play with your children.""
Marc H. Morial, President of the National Urban League: ""It's significant, because it is a serious effort by the administration to, in effect, enforce one of the legacy civil rights laws. The country has to confront this, and it is my hope that this rule will help us change this paradigm, because this pattern of residential segregation, isolated pockets of poverty, is not just confined to the cities.""
Wade Henderson, President and CEO of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights: ""This rule will help our nation move forward on the largely unrealized promise of the Fair Housing Act: that Americans are free to live in the communities of their choice, regardless of their race, family, or disability status. At a time of heightened concern across the country over threats to racial justice, as seen in places like Ferguson, Missouri, and Baltimore, Maryland, a fully functioning and effective Fair Housing Act is more important than ever. When Americans are denied equal opportunity to housing, they are denied access to good jobs, quality education, safe streets, accessible transit, and a clean and healthy environment, all of which are critical to leading healthy and prosperous lives. We applaud Secretary Castro and the Obama administration for taking this affirmative step to ensure fair housing opportunities for all.""
Sheila Crowley, President and CEO of National Low Income Housing Coalition: ""The regulation will provide jurisdictions with guidance in complying with their existing obligations. This is a gigantic step in the right direction. The issuance of HUD's final rule today puts local and state policymakers on notice that fair housing is an obligation, not a choice.""
Ed Gramlich, a special advisor to the National Low Income Housing Coalition: ""This is going to be an incredibly important and positive step to changing things over the long run.""
Philip Tegeler, Executive Director - Poverty & Race Research Action Council: ""This rule forces us to address the American paradigm of separate and unequal. It asks cities and towns to confront the consequences of their past policies and decide how to move forward in a fair, inclusive and democratic way.""
Shanna L. Smith; President and CEO, National Fair Housing Alliance: ""We applaud HUD for releasing this important rule, and look forward to working with HUD on its implementation.""
Debby Goldberg, National Fair Housing Alliance: ""Bundled together with where you live is a whole bunch of other things like where your kids go to school, what kind of transportation is going to serve you, what kinds of jobs you have access to, whether you have a healthy environment. The goal of this rule is to make sure we have greater equity and equality in terms of access to the opportunities that people need to succeed in life.""
Chris Estes, President and CEO, National Housing Conference: ""HUD has taken a major positive step forward with this rule. Now HUD and local jurisdictions need to get to work together to build the trust that can lead to real change in communities.""
Angela G. Blackwell, Founder and CEO, PolicyLink: ""We saw local leaders appreciate their ability to make decisions informed by data, community knowledge, and drawing from best practices. They were hungry to address the longstanding challenges that reinforce poverty and limit opportunity. Today, we are one step closer to creating a more fair and just America.""
Solomon Greene and Erika C. Poethig of the Urban Institute: ""In some places, effective strategies might involve preserving affordable housing in a gentrifying urban area where market pressures are squeezing out lower-income minority residents; in others, it might involve breaking down exclusionary barriers that prevent the construction of affordable housing in wealthier suburban areas."" Read more (www.urban.org/urban-wire/creating-places-opportunity-huds-new-data-and-community-driven-approach).
Diane Glauber, Co-Director of the Lawyers' Committee's Fair Housing & Community Development Project: ""The finalization of the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing regulation is a critical step toward the realization of the Fair Housing Act's vision of open, inclusive communities. For far too long, the investment of federal housing funds has perpetuated the segregated status quo.""
Margaret K. Suib, Esq, Norwalk Fair Housing Office: ""Although we have made progress, we are also remain a highly segregated society. Maps of cities, including in Connecticut, illustrate how segregated our communities are. Yet, where you live has a big impact on how life unfolds. It determines the schools your children attend, the jobs you have access to, the quality of your surroundings, your access to transportation and grocery stores and other important community resources, which then help determine your health, wealth, education and opportunity. In our region, too many children are growing up in neighborhoods lacking in the high quality resources. This not only limits their life perspectives, but undermines out region's prosperity. The new HUD rule will help all jurisdictions in Connecticut, and indeed all over America, be more deliberate and strategic about how we use housing and community development resources to expand access to opportunity for all residents of our community. Norwalk's Fair Housing Advisory Commission and I look forward to working with local policymakers, to ensure that all people regardless of race, religion, ethnicity, family status or disability, can choose where to live, and all neighborhoods are good places to live. WE have advocated for this rule for some years now, and are extremely gratified that HUD has now released it.""
Melody Woosley, Director of the San Antonio Human Service Department: ""The new rules improve past regulations and provide the opportunity for full community input on the issue of housing for the low-income and disabled populations. Additionally, it allows for advance notice to the community about impending changes in their neighborhood, which will improve the community input process.""
Marlene Nagel, Mid-America Regional Council: ""I think it raised awareness locally of issues related to affordable housing and access to resources. There has been an increased recognition of the need for greater housing choice throughout our community.""
Raphael Bostic, Professor with the Sol Price School of Public Policy at the University of Southern California: ""Americans really do care about broader society and broader community. I think that just by virtue of having that conversation we're going to see a bunch of really innovative and really interesting things emerge.""
Shelley Poticha, Director of Urban Solutions at the Natural Resources Defense Council: ""For far too long, our challenge has been to dig deep into our racial and economic history and pinpoint the barriers that prevent some Americans from enjoying what many of us take for granted -- clean air and water, affordable housing, safe streets, good schools, healthy food and convenient and affordable access to jobs. The new rules are an important and long-awaited step toward improving the lives of millions of Americans. Housing policies have long been a driver of national living patterns, contributing to suburban sprawl and an increase in greenhouse gas emissions. These rules will help achieve a goal defined as important to our country more than a half-century ago. They have the potential to level the playing field in cities across America, giving struggling neighborhoods greater opportunities to thrive and prosper - while offering low-income Americans the chance to raise their families in neighborhoods where there are more choices for a brighter future.''

07/13/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-086.cfm,HUD Issues Guidance on Multifamily Assisted and Insured Housing Based on Equal Access to Housing Rule,"WASHINGTON - As part of the White House Conference on Aging today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) issued guidance to better serve and help avoid discrimination to LGBT Americans seeking HUD-assisted or HUD-insured housing. The guidance will help clarify the Equal Access to Housing in HUD Programs Regardless of Sexual Orientation or Gender Identity Rule (Equal Access Rule), which was originally published in 2012. The Equal Access Rule ensures that housing across HUD programs is open to all eligible individuals regardless of actual or perceived sexual orientation, gender identity or marital status, including Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly.
""Every American deserves to live with dignity, regardless of who they love or who they are,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""HUD is committed to fighting unjust discrimination and to expanding housing opportunity for all.""
HUD's guidance on multifamily and insured housing programs clarifies that a determination of eligibility for housing that is assisted by HUD or subject to a mortgage insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) shall be made in accordance with the eligibility requirements provided for such a program by HUD, and be made available without regard to actual or perceived sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital status. The guidance also clarifies that no owner of administrator of HUD-assisted or HUD-insured housing, approved lender in an FHA mortgage insurance program, nor any recipient or sub-recipient of HUD funds may inquire about the sexual orientation or gender identity of an applicant for, or occupant of, HUD-assisted housing or housing whose financing is insured by HUD, whether renter or owner occupied.
Violations of the rule and guidance could result in HUD's determination that the owner has failed to comply with program requirements. HUD may pursue any available remedy, including sanctions, that it determines appropriate to remedy the violation.
The creation and implementation of the Equal Access Rule builds on HUD's and President Obama's commitment to expanding opportunity, advancing equality, and leveling the playing field for the LGBT. Since 2010, HUD has taken steps to strengthen LGBT protections, such as formally adopting the principle that gender identity discrimination is sex discrimination under the Fair Housing Act, releasing a groundbreaking study on LGBT housing discrimination, and pursuing complaints under the Equal Access Rule. The multifamily assisted and insured housing guidance follows additional guidance issued by HUD in February on home lending and transgender access to homeless shelters.

07/14/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-087.cfm,2015 HUD Secretary's Award for Healthy Homes Winners Announced,"WASHINGTON - Four model programs in Alaska, Maine, Missouri and Wisconsin are winners of the inaugural HUD Secretary's Award for Healthy Homes (www.huduser.org/portal/about/AwardForHealthy_Homes2015_1.html), each being recognized for excellence in promoting resident health through housing interventions. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the National Environmental Health Association (NEHA) selected:
• Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium in Anchorage, Alaska;
• Children's Mercy Hospitals and Clinics in Kansas City, Missouri;
• Breathe Easy Coalition of Maine in Portland, Maine; and
• Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority in Madison, Wisconsin.
Each awardee demonstrated that their activities or policies showed measurable benefits in the health of lower income residents. The awards were presented at the NEHA Annual Educational Conference & Exhibition in Orlando, Florida on July 13.
""From reducing second-hand smoke to improving the lives of children with asthma and allergies, these organizations are leading the way in creating healthy environments for families to thrive,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""I commend these winners for their efforts, and look forward to working with all our partners to enhance the well-being of Americans today, tomorrow, and always.""
The 2015 HUD Secretary's Healthy Homes Award recognizes excellence in healthy housing innovation and achievement in three categories:
Healthy Homes Innovation and Achievement in Cross Sector Coordination among Health, Environment and Housing (Two Awardees):
Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium - The Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium (ANTHC) provides comprehensive medical and preventive health services for Alaska Natives and American Indians residing in Alaska. In 2011, the ANTHC's Environmental Health Program assembled a diverse group of partners to develop and test an intervention to reduce the need for respiratory medical care among high risk Native children through healthier housing and improved air quality. Interventions included addressing mold and moisture problems, improving ventilation, changing out old leaky woodstove with more efficient models and providing education to reinforce healthy behaviors. After 3 years, involving 63 homes and 8 communities, the program has documented effectiveness. Pre- and post-intervention air monitoring found a 26% decrease in carbon dioxide, a 68% decrease in volatile organic compounds, and a 21% decrease in particulates. Data from the lung health questionnaires shows a 50% reduction in clinic visits and 27% reduction in missed days of school due to respiratory symptoms.
Children's Mercy Hospitals and Clinics (CMH) is a non-profit academic hospital in Kansas City, Missouri. CHM developed a comprehensive Center for Environmental Health that provides patient based services, provider education, professional training and community outreach and advocacy, while supporting environmental research on children's health. Through a series of successful HUD healthy homes demonstration grants, EPA grants, and foundation grants, combined with help and collaboration from dedicated community partners, the CMH assessed environmental conditions and performed repairs or provided healthy home supplies in over 700 homes. These efforts resulted in the development of an effective case management service model that has been effective at improving the health of pediatric patients with asthma and allergies, or who are lead poisoned.
Healthy Homes Innovation and Achievement in Public Policy:
Smoke-Free Housing Coalition of Maine - The Smoke-Free Housing Coalition of Maine is a leader in the smoke-free housing movement for 13 years, is working to reduce involuntary exposure to secondhand smoke for tenants across Maine. With the Coalition leading the charge, Maine became the first state in the nation to implement a 100% smoke-free policy as a threshold requirement for its state Tax Credit Qualified Allocation Plan application. In addition, all 20 of Maine's Public Housing Authorities have adopted a smoke-free housing policy to make their buildings, including individual units and common areas, smoke-free. Maine was the first state in the nation to protect all of its public housing tenants from secondhand smoke. These public policies have also fostered changes in private sector housing. A recent state-wide survey found that 65% of Maine landlords report having a smoke-free policy and 62% of tenants report living in a 100% smoke-free building.
Healthy Homes Innovation and Achievement in Public Housing/ Multifamily Supported Housing:
Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority (WHEDA) provided construction and permanent loans, and Low-Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC) to finance Highland Commons, a 50-unit development in West Allis, Wisconsin. Highland Commons was designed to meet the special needs of tenants with persistent mental illness. All of the units are set-aside for households at or below 60% of County Median Income. Services are provided at no charge to residents through a Wellness Recovery Action Plan designed for each resident based on their individual needs. Two years after its opening, Highland Commons has helped improve the quality of life for its residents with: 1) an increase in daily living skills, 2) a decrease in psychiatric hospitalization or Primary Care Sensitive visits, and 3) an ability to achieve housing stability with an apartment rental lasting more than a year.
The jury for the HUD Secretary Awards included: Sandra Whitehead, MPA, PhD, NEHA Healthy Homes and Healthy Communities Technical Advisor (Director of Healthy Community Design, NACCHO, Washington, DC); Felix Zemel, MCP, MPH, REHS/RS, CEHT, HHS, DAAS, NEHA Land Use Planning and Design Technical Advisor (Health Agent, Cohasset Board of Health, Cohasset, MA); Stephan Ruckman, NEHA Schools and Institutions Technical Advisor (EH Manager, Worthington City Schools, Dublin, OH); Tara Gurge, MS, RS, NEHA Radiation and Radon Technical Advisor (EH Agent, Town of Needham Public Health Dept., Needham, MA); and David Gilkey, PhD, NEHA Air Quality Technical Advisor (Associate Professor, Colorado State University."
07/15/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-090.cfm,President Obama and Secretary Castro Announce Initiative to Extend High Speed Broadband Access for Students in HUD-Assisted Housing,"WASHINGTON - Building on the Obama Administration's goal to expand high speed broadband to all Americans, today, President Obama and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Julián Castro announced, ConnectHome (http://connecthome.hud.gov/), an initiative to extend affordable broadband access to families living in HUD-assisted housing. Through ConnectHome, Internet Service Providers, non-profits and the private sector will offer broadband access, technical training, digital literacy programs, and devices for residents in assisted housing units in 28 communities across the nation.
Since 2009, the private and public sectors have invested over $260 billion into new broadband infrastructure, and three in four Americans now use broadband at home. Despite this significant progress, one in four American families still don't access the internet at home, particularly lower-income families with children. While nearly two-thirds of America's lowest-income households own a computer, less than half have a home internet subscription. HUD's ConnectHome initiative strives to ensure that students can access the same level of high-speed Internet at home that they possess in their classrooms.
""America's challenge in this 21st century is to remain the world's undisputed land of opportunity"", said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""By expanding broadband adoption, ConnectHome will provide more Americans with the same high-speed access to knowledge and opportunity that millions of people already enjoy.""
The President and HUD Secretary Julián Castro announced that HUD has selected the following twenty-seven cities and one tribal nation to participate in ConnectHome:
Albany, GA; Atlanta, GA; Baltimore, MD; Baton Rouge, LA; Boston, MA; Camden, NJ; Choctaw Nation, OK; Cleveland, OH; Denver, CO; Durham, NC; Fresno, CA; Kansas City, MO; Little Rock, AR; Los Angeles, CA; Macon, GA; Memphis, TN; Meriden, CT; Nashville, TN; New Orleans, LA; New York, NY; Newark, NJ; Philadelphia, PA; Rockford, IL; San Antonio, TX; Seattle, WA; Springfield, MA; Tampa, FL; and Washington, DC.
HUD selected these communities through a competitive process that took into account local commitment to expanding broadband opportunities; presence of place-based programs; and other factors to ensure all are well-positioned to deliver on ConnectHome.
HUD, is collaborating with EveryoneOn and US Ignite who worked with private- and public-sector leaders to build local partnerships and gather commitments that will increase access to the Internet for low-income Americans. These partnerships will bring broadband, technical assistance, and digital literacy training to students living in public and assisted housing across America.
ConnectHome is informed by the great work of local communities across the country. The Housing Authority of the City of Austin (HACA) has created a transformational series of public-private-partnerships to narrow the digital divide in its communities and will serve as a mentor city for all 28 Connect Home communities.
Today's announcement marks a major step in providing communities across the nation tools to improve digital opportunity for HUD-assisted housing residents. ConnectHome establishes a platform for collaboration between local governments, members of private industry, nonprofit organizations, and other interested entities to produce locally-tailored solutions for narrowing the digital divide.
Eight nationwide Internet Service Providers including; Google Fiber, Cherokee Communications, Pine Telephone, Suddenlink Communications, Vyve Broadband, CenturyLink, Cox Communications and Sprint have announced they are partnering with mayors, public housing authorities, non-profit groups, and for-profit entities to bridge the gap in digital access for students living in assisted housing units.
Skills training is essential to effectively taking advantage of all the Internet offers. HUD is collaborating with Best Buy, The James M. Cox Foundation, a Cox Communications-affiliated Foundation, GitHub, College Board, in partnership with Khan Academy, 80/20 Foundation, Age of Learning, Inc., The Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), The American Library Association, Boys & Girls Clubs of America, Southeastern Oklahoma State University and the Durant Independent School District to offer new technical training and digital literacy programs for residents in assisted housing units.
HUD is also taking major steps to provide communities across the nation tools to improve digital opportunity for its residents. Today, Secretary Castro announced that HUD will:
Begin rulemaking that requires HUD-funded new residential construction and substantial rehabilitation projects to support broadband internet connectivity. Provide communities with the flexibility to spend portions of their Choice Neighborhood Implementation Grants on local broadband initiatives and associated connectivity enhancements,including approximately $150 million dedicated to the current competition. Begin rulemaking to include broadband planning as a component of the Consolidated Planning process, which serves as a framework for a community-wide dialogue to identify housing and municipal development priorities. Supply guidance and share best practices with HUD-funded grantees on how to more effectively utilize HUD funding to support broadband connectivity. Integrate digital literacy programming and access to technology into related initiatives.

07/16/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-091.cfm,HUD Charges South Dakota Property Owners with Discriminating Against Resident with Disabilities,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is charging the owners and landlords of a 36-unit complex in Sioux Falls, South Dakota with violating the Fair Housing Act by initially refusing to allow a resident with disabilities to have an emotional support animal. HUD's charge alleges that even after the resident obtained a support dog, the owners, Robert Christensen, Linda Christensen, and Viking Villas, LLC, placed overly burdensome requirements on the resident's use of the dog.
The Fair Housing Act requires housing providers to make reasonable accommodations in policies or practices when a person with a disability requires such accommodations, including granting waivers to ""no-pet"" policies for persons who require assistance or support animals. Additionally, the law makes it unlawful to make housing unavailable to any person because of a disability.
""Housing providers need to understand that many persons with disabilities need support animals to assist them in life's daily functions,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD remains committed to taking action when it learns that housing providers are failing to meet their obligation to provide reasonable accommodations when needed.""
The case came to HUD's attention when the woman, who has a mental disability, filed a complaint alleging that the apartment owners initially refused to allow her to have a support animal and asked her to give 60-days' notice to vacate the apartment if she insisted on getting one. When she obtained a dog and requested a reasonable accommodation to keep the animal, the owners requested verification of the animal's proper inoculations and licensure with the city before responding to her request. Upon granting her request, they also required her to sign a ""Companion Animal/Pet Policy Agreement"" that included discriminatory provisions that (1) allowed the landlords to revoke approval of the animal at their ""sole discretion;"" (2) imposed size, weight, and breed limitations on assistance animals; (3) required that assistance animals be more than six months old at the time they are acquired; (4) allowed the landlord to enter the apartment to inspect for damage suspected to have been caused by the assistance animal; and (5) allowed the landlord to evict her for failure to comply with any of the agreement's provisions.
Eventually the woman moved out for fear of losing her housing because of her support animal.
Read HUD's charge against the South Dakota property owners.
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages to the woman for the harm caused her by the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose fines to vindicate the public interest. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages.
In FY 2014, disability was the most common basis of complaints filed with HUD and its partner agencies, being cited as a basis for 4,606 complaints, or 54 percent of the overall total.
Read HUD's notice regarding service or companion animals.
Persons who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to www.hud.gov/fairhousing, or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, which can be accessed through Apple devices, such as the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch."
07/16/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-092.cfm,FHA Announces Additional Steps to Spur Affordable Housing Development,"WASHINGTON - The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) published a notice (www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2015-07-16/pdf/2015-17464.pdf) today providing guidance on the new Small Buildings Risk Sharing (SBRS) Initiative. SBRS invites new private sector high-capacity lenders to partner with FHA to provide long-term fixed-rate lending products to multifamily property owners with mortgages of $3 million and up to $5 million in high-cost areas. SBRS builds on the successful record of affordable housing lending under HUD's existing Risk Sharing programs with state and local housing finance agencies as well as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
""Communities across the nation are seeking ways to support affordable housing production and preservation,"" said Ed Golding, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for HUD's Office of Housing. ""The risk share initiative allows us to target our products to an important and underserved part of the rental market by partnering with CDFIs and other lenders who have on the ground relationships with small building owners in their communities. By offering FHA mortgage insurance and facilitating access to long-term fixed rate capital we can help preserve affordable housing for property owners and tenants.""
Small buildings comprise 34 percent of the total 17.5 million multifamily rental units in the U.S., housing nearly 6 million households and, on average, offer lower rents than larger properties[1]. Nearly 60 percent of small rental property owners are individuals, households and estates who face significant constraints accessing financing due to more stringent credit standards than larger property owners and the loss of many local banks after the 2008 recession. SBRS is designed to encourage lenders to enter this market and provide long-term, fixed rate capital to small building owners.
In return for assuming 50 percent of the risk, approved lenders in the program underwrite and service the loans subject to minimum standards which can reduce processing times relative to traditional FHA mortgage insurance programs. FHA's willingness to assume half of the risk can free up lenders' balance sheets and allow them to increase their lending activities without an additional federal subsidy or new regulations.
Given the challenges of accessing long-term fixed rate capital even with an FHA guaranty, the Administration has asked the Congress for statutory relief to allow SBRS lenders to access funding through Ginnie Mae; in the interim, lenders will be eligible to access capital from the United States Treasury's Federal Financing Bank at prevailing Ginnie Mae rates.
SBRS will provide new opportunities for lenders to make loans in rural communities. Rural communities have a disproportionately high share of small multifamily properties that could benefit from this program. Lending under this initiative will be limited to properties which are willing to meet affordability requirements to ensure at least of 20 percent of units rent for no more than 50 percent of area median income or 40 percent of the units rent for 60 percent of area median income.

EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take two months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, 4 months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2%) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90-percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised about three percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found on our web site listed above.
* 90% confidence interval includes zero. The Census Bureau does not have sufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero.

Within PD&R, he will help set the agenda for housing finance research and play a key role in a range of housing finance projects.
Specifically, Green will help guide HUD's ongoing efforts to ensure continued access to homeownership and multifamily investment opportunities for creditworthy borrowers. He will be part of PD&R's work with the FHA and participate in cross agency housing groups, such as the Rental Policy Working Group and others.
Katherine O'Regan, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research said, ""We're delighted that Richard is bringing his significant experience and talent to HUD this year. His expertise will be immediately leveraged both for our housing finance efforts today and to help set our future research agenda.""
Green comes to HUD from his role as Director of the University of Southern California's Lusk Center, which seeks to advance real estate knowledge, inform business practice, and address timely issues that affect the real estate industry, the urban economy, and public policy. Green will return as Director after June 2016."
07/20/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-093.cfm,HUD and VA Announce Additional Support to Help Homeless Veterans Find Permanent Homes,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) today announced a second round funding to help provide permanent homes to an estimated 122 veterans experiencing homelessness in eight states. The rental assistance announced today is provided through the HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) Program which combines rental assistance from HUD with case management and clinical services provided by VA (see attached list of HUD's voucher awards).
This year marks the 50th anniversary of HUD and Secretary Julián Castro is focused on advancing policies that create opportunities for all Americans, including the broader Administration goal of ending homelessness among veterans.
""Today is another important step in honoring the service and sacrifice of the brave men and women of our Armed Forces,"" said Secretary Julián Castro. ""HUD and its local partners are determined to give every veteran the opportunity to secure a safe and stable place to call home.""
""The Department of Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development and our federal and local partners should be proud of the gains made reducing veteran homelessness,"" said Secretary of Veterans Affairs Robert McDonald, ""but so long as there remains a veteran living on our streets, we have more work to do. The vouchers made available today are a vital tool to making sure veterans across the country have a home.""
In April, HUD awarded $65 million to help more than 9,300 homeless veterans find a home. That funding ensured that communities could provide the critically needed housing assistance and case management services to those veterans and their families experiencing homelessness.
In 2010, President Obama and 19 federal agencies and offices that form the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH) launched the nation's first comprehensive strategy to prevent and end homelessness. Opening Doors: Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness (www.usich.gov/opening_doors/) serves as a roadmap for how the federal government will work with state and local communities to confront the root causes of homelessness, especially among former servicemen and women. To support communities as they progress towards the goal of ending veteran homelessness, USICH has identified strategies that increase collaboration and coordination among programs serving veterans experiencing homelessness.
Since 2008, more than 79,000 vouchers have been awarded and approximately 90,000 homeless veterans have been served through the HUD-VASH program. Rental assistance and supportive services provided through HUD-VASH are a critical resource for local communities in ending homelessness among our nation's Veterans.
In the HUD-VASH program, VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) assess veterans experiencing homelessness before referring them to local housing agencies for these vouchers. Decisions are based on a variety of factors, most importantly the duration of homelessness and the need for longer term, more intensive support in obtaining and maintaining permanent housing. The HUD-VASH program includes both the rental assistance the voucher provides and the comprehensive case management that VAMC staff offers.
Veterans participating in the HUD-VASH program rent privately owned housing and generally contribute no more than 30 percent of their income toward rent. VA offers eligible homeless veterans clinical and supportive services through its medical centers across the U.S., Guam, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands."
07/22/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-088.cfm,HUD and Department of Labor Launch Training Curriculum for HIV/AIDS Housing and Service Providers,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Office of HIV/AIDS Housing, in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Labor's (DOL) Office of Disability Employment Policy (ODEP), today unveiled a new training curriculum for HIV/AIDS housing and service providers focused on employment services.
Getting to Work (https://www.hudexchange.info/training-events/dol-hud-getting-to-work-curriculum-for-hiv-aids-providers/) is a three-part, multi-media curriculum which offers HIV/AIDS service and housing providers information to connect their clients with the jobs they need to stay healthy and move toward self-sufficiency. Getting to Work developed with input from several HIV/AIDS service providers across the country that has demonstrated leadership in this area, as well as the National Working Positive Coalition, an ODEP Alliance partner.
The training curriculum is the culmination of a range of activities undertaken by HUD and DOL in recent years to expand the conversation about HIV/AIDS to address employment. Both HUD and DOL are lead agencies under President Obama's National HIV/AIDS Strategy—the nation's first-ever comprehensive plan for responding to the serious and ongoing domestic HIV epidemic.
""Every person should have the chance to build a brighter tomorrow,"" said Secretary Julián Castro. ""HUD is proud to partner with the Department of Labor to ensure that Americans living with HIV/AIDS can access the skills and the opportunities they need to find rewarding careers. By supporting these men and women as they lead healthy and fulfilling lives, we're advancing equality and promoting prosperity for our entire nation.""
""There is a clear need to include employment opportunities in the conversation about providing services for people with HIV/AIDS,"" said Labor Secretary Thomas E. Perez. ""Employment not only offers individuals the opportunity to live an independent, self-directed life, it also affects a person's health and reduces reliance on public benefits and services.""

A Year of Progress: Delivering on the Promise of Opportunity
HUD is the Department of Opportunity and has been at the heart of the federal government's efforts to assist the American people in building a more prosperous future. As HUD approaches its 50th anniversary, Secretary Castro is laser focused on advancing policies that provide folks with access to quality housing, good schools, transportation and economic opportunity.
We recognize housing as a platform for Americans who are striving to improve their lives and break the cycle of poverty for the next generation. As needs for our services have increased, HUD will continue to invest in initiatives that have demonstrated outcomes in helping the people we serve.
Just in the past year, under Secretary Castro's leadership, HUD has taken significant actions to help individuals and families access more opportunity.
Making Homeownership More Affordable
On January 8, 2015, Secretary Castro announced that the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) would reduce the annual premiums for new borrowers by half of a percentage point. This action is making homeownership more affordable for responsible families. It is helping save an average of $900 annually for more than 2 million borrowers over the next three years. It is also projected to spur 250,000 new homebuyers over the same time period.
Helping Working Families Afford Rent
HUD's 2016 Budget maintains a core commitment to provide opportunity for families receiving rental assistance and those households seeking to become homeowners. This includes funding all existing rental assistance vouchers serving 2.4 million low-income households and restoring the 67,000 vouchers lost in 2013 due to sequestration.
President Obama launched the Opening Doors initiative in 2010, the Federal Government's first-ever strategy to prevent and end homelessness. Since then, local communities around the nation reported a 10-percent decline in the total number of persons experiencing homelessness and a remarkable 25-percent drop in the number of those living on the streets. In addition, state and local planning agencies' counts have shown a 33-percent drop in homelessness among veterans, including a 43-percent reduction in unsheltered homelessness among veterans.
This year, as part of HUD's mission and commitment to help end homelessness, Secretary Castro announced the following actions:
Expanding HUD VASH to Native American and Tribal Communities - On January 30, 2015, HUD and the VA expanded the HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) Program into Native American and tribal communities. The program expansion invests $4 million to support Native American veterans experiencing homelessness by providing them with secure housing and connecting them with clinical services and case management. It is estimated that this will expand opportunity for approximately 650 Native American veterans who are currently homeless or at risk of homelessness. Requesting Assistance for the Most Vulnerable - To achieve the goals of Opening Doors initiative, the 2016 Budget proposes to invest $2.5 billion for the Continuum of Care and Emergency Solutions Grant Programs. This represents an increase of $345 million above current funding levels and would provide an additional 25,500 new permanent supportive housing units for persons experiencing long-term or chronic homelessness. HUD is also seeking funding to prevent homelessness for 15,000 families with children by requesting $332 million for housing assistance for low-income persons living with HIV/AIDS and their families.
• Expanding HUD VASH to Native American and Tribal Communities - On January 30, 2015, HUD and the VA expanded the HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) Program into Native American and tribal communities. The program expansion invests $4 million to support Native American veterans experiencing homelessness by providing them with secure housing and connecting them with clinical services and case management. It is estimated that this will expand opportunity for approximately 650 Native American veterans who are currently homeless or at risk of homelessness.

Making Affordable Housing More Energy Efficient (https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/07/07/increasing-solar-access-all-americans)
The President Obama's Climate Action Plan called for the installation of 100 megawatts (MW) of solar energy on low- and moderate-income housing. To date, more than 185 MW of solar energy have been installed across the nation. The success of these efforts has led the Administration to announce that we are tripling the current goal, and setting a new goal to install 300 MW of solar for low-and-moderate income housing by 2020.
Increasing Energy Efficiency Financing
On January 29, 2015, Secretary Castro and California Governor Jerry Brown announced a number of actions to expand financing for energy efficiency and solar energy in multifamily housing. These actions also put us on a track to reach the President's goal of installing 100 megawatts of renewable energy across federally subsidized housing by 2020.
Two actions were particularly important to HUD:
Implementing Property-Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) Financing for Multifamily Housing in California. Creating On-Bill Repayment in Affordable Multifamily Properties.
• Implementing Property-Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) Financing for Multifamily Housing in California.
• Creating On-Bill Repayment in Affordable Multifamily Properties.
Announced the Largest Public Housing Authority Energy Savings Program
On April 9, 2015, Secretary Castro and New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio launched the largest energy savings program for any public housing authority in the nation. Through a series of competitive Energy Performance Contracts (EPC), it is estimated that at least $100 million in work will occur across nearly 300 NYCHA developments to upgrade and retrofit thousands of buildings, dramatically reducing greenhouse gas emissions and generating tens of millions of dollars in cost savings, as well as creating more than 500 jobs.
Expanding Internet Access for Students and Families
On July 15, 2015, Secretary Castro announced, ConnectHome (http://connecthome.hud.gov/), an initiative to extend affordable broadband access to families living in HUD-assisted housing. Through ConnectHome, Internet Service Providers, non-profits and the private sector will offer broadband access, technical training, digital literacy programs, and devices for residents in assisted housing units in 28 communities across the nation. Every child deserves a fair shot at achieving their dreams, and by equipping our children with the technology skills they need, we're giving them the tools to succeed academically, preparing them to thrive in tomorrow's job market and to break the cycle of poverty.
Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing
On July 8, 2015 HUD released the final Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing Rule (AFFH) which clarifies and simplifies existing fair housing obligations and creates a streamlined Assessment of Fair Housing planning process, which will help communities analyze challenges to fair housing choice and establish their own goals and priorities to address the fair housing barriers in their community. AFFH is part of the 1968 Fair Housing Act's obligation for state and local governments to improve housing policies to achieve more meaningful outcomes so that every American can live where they want to, regardless of their race, color, national origin, religion, sex, disability or familial status.
Expanding Jobs and Family Self-Sufficiency
The Budget includes a request of $100 million for Jobs-Plus, an $85 million increase from FY 2015, and would allow Tribally Designated Housing Entities to administer a Jobs-Plus Program. Jobs-Plus provides intensive, employment-focused programs targeting every able-bodied, working-age government assistance recipient at a public housing development. To further encourage self-sufficiency among HUD-assisted households, the Budget seeks $85 million for the Family Self-Sufficiency Program to fund approximately 1,600 Family Self-Sufficiency Program Coordinators who will serve approximately 80,000 families to boost savings, earnings, and employment rates among program participants.
Enforcing the Law and Fighting Discrimination
HUD continues to demonstrate its commitment to fair housing enforcement, particularly pursuing cases that impact women. In the past eight months, HUD has announced four settlements on behalf of women who were discriminated against because they were victims of domestic violence. HUD also finalized two settlements with lenders who discriminated against women who were on maternity leave or pregnant, including a historic $5 million settlement with Wells Fargo for discriminating against women who were pregnant.
Expanding Protections for Domestic Violence Survivors
No woman should have to choose between calling for help and being evicted from her home. That is why on March 24, 2015, Secretary Castro today announced a new proposed rule to increase protections for domestic violence survivors. The rule would implement the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 (VAWA 2013), which expands HUD's authority to protect survivors of domestic and dating violence, stalking, and sexual assault who are residing in housing assisted by HUD.These women and their families deserve fair housing, not eviction. By proposing this rule, HUD is taking a positive step to ensure that survivors of abuse will not live in fear of losing their homes simply because of their status as a survivor.
Providing Equal Access to LGBT Americans
As part of HUD's Equal Access to Housing in HUD Programs Regardless of Sexual Orientation or Gender Identity Rule (Equal Access Rule), Secretary Castro issued further guidance this year to better serve LGBT Americans seeking to become homeowners, live in HUD subsidized senior housing, and transgender individuals seeking access to homeless shelters. Issued in 2012, the Equal Access Rule ensures that housing across HUD programs is open to all eligible individuals regardless of actual or perceived sexual orientation, gender identity or marital status.

Strengthening all communities in this Century of Cities
Expanding Rental Assistance
There is an estimated $26 billion backlog in capital needs in our nation's public housing. Every year, the nation loses 10,000 public housing units to disrepair. In December 2014, HUD announced that Congress expanded HUD's Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) initiative by lifting the cap on the number of units of public housing that could be converted. Previously; HUD was limited to 60,000 units that could be converted. However, with the new legislation, HUD will be able to convert 185,000 units.To date, RAD has leveraged over $1 billion in total construction activity.
Investing in Neighborhood Revitalization
To empower local communities, the 2016 Budget would expand opportunity in high poverty areas by investing $250 million to transform neighborhoods through the Choice Neighborhoods Program. HUD is also proposing to expand the authority it offers to select Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) through Moving to Work. This program allows these PHAs greater flexibility to make local decisions about how to operate their housing programs and test innovative ways to improve self-sufficiency, mobility, academic performance and other outcomes for HUD-assisted tenants.
Growing Promise Zones Initiative
On April 28, 2015, Secretary Castro announced the expansion of the Promise Zones Initiative to eight additional cities across the nation, including Ferguson, MO. The Promise Zones program recognizes that challenges like poverty, low educational attainment, limited economic development, poor housing, and public safety are not stand-alone issues. They require holistic solutions. Through the Promise Zones designation, these communities will work directly with federal, state and local agencies to give local leaders proven tools to improve the quality of life in some of the country's most vulnerable areas.
More Efficient and Effective Operations
Secretary Castro and Deputy Secretary Nani Coloretti have led an operational and management review to ensure HUD is directing resources to its highest priorities. This review focused on three areas:
Investing in Leadership and Collaboration: HUD has re-established a Senior Executive Service (SES) candidate development program to better equip future leaders to lead and enable effective succession planning. Increasing Accountability and Customer Service: HUD has established a new quarterly governance process to provide leadership on-going visibility into management metrics and goals and to use data to make better operational decisions. Prioritizing our Resources: In service of enterprise-wide coordination, HUD has already moved transactional hiring responsibilities to Treasury's shared service provider and will be moving financial management and internal controls in the fall, getting out of the business of doing back office work in order to better focus on its mission.

Increasing Employee Engagement
HUD leadership set an ambitious goal to increase participation in 2015's Employee Viewpoint Survey (EVS) to collect better data on how the Department can work together to serve the American people. This resulted in increasing employee participation from 51-percent to more than 73-percent. HUD currently has the highest response rate in the Department's history and the second-highest year-over-year increase in the Federal Government."
07/31/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-100.cfm,HUD Charges South Dakota Property Owners with Discriminating Against Resident in Wheelchair,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has charged the owners and landlords of an eight-unit apartment complex in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, with violating the Fair Housing Act by refusing to allow a resident with disabilities to use a wheelchair in his apartment. HUD's charge also alleges that the Salem Family Trust and Calvin L. Salem, trustee and manager of the property, refused to return the resident's security deposit after he was forced to move out of his apartment. Read HUD's charge.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from making a rental unit unavailable because of disability, discriminating in the terms of a rental because of disability, making statements regarding a rental that indicate discrimination based on disability, or retaliating against anyone for exercising their fair housing rights.
""Wheelchair users can never feel at home if they aren't allowed to use the very thing they depend on for mobility,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD remains committed to enforcing the nation's fair housing laws and creating greater housing opportunities for people with disabilities.""
The case came to HUD's attention when a resident filed a complaint alleging that Salem discriminated against people with disabilities by prohibiting the use of wheelchairs in his apartments. The resident also alleged that Salem made discriminatory statements about his disability on three separate occasions. At one point, while the man was recovering from a leg injury at a nursing facility, staff at the facility received an unsolicited letter from Salem stating that the man was not welcome back to his apartment because he was incapable of living independently and his wheelchair would damage the carpet.
Sometime later, the man was served with a notice to vacate and moved out. Salem, however, refused to return the man's $350 security deposit and retaliated against him by providing a negative reference to a prospective landlord because the man had filed a housing discrimination complaint with HUD.
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages for the harm caused by the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose fines to vindicate the public interest. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages.
In FY 2014, disability was the most common basis of complaints filed with HUD and its partner agencies, being cited as a basis for 4,606 complaints, or 54 percent of the overall total.
People who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to www.hud.gov/fairhousing, or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, which can be accessed through Apple devices, such as the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch."
08/05/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-101.cfm,HUD Proposes Rule to Clarify the Equal Participation of Religious Organizations in HUD Programs,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced today that it is issuing a proposed rule that would amend its existing regulations regarding the equal participation of faith-based (religious) organizations in HUD programs.
The amendments are being undertaken to implement Executive Order (EO) 13559, Fundamental Principles and Policymaking Criteria for Partnerships with Faith-Based and Other Neighborhood Organizations, which President Obama signed in November 2010. EO 13559 sets forth principles clarifying that religious providers are welcome to compete for Federal funding without loss of their religious identity, and providing protections for program beneficiaries, including a referral process for beneficiaries who object to the religious character of an organization that operates a program with direct Federal funds. EO 13559 also established the Interagency Working Group on Faith-Based and Other Neighborhood Partnerships (Working Group) for the purpose of reviewing and evaluating Federal agencies' existing regulations and policies, and developing a model set of regulations.
In August 2013, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) instructed agency heads to adopt regulatory changes and guidance consistent with model regulations and guidance developed by the Working Group. OMB emphasized the importance of uniform implementation of the principles in EO 13559. HUD's proposed regulations are consistent with those being issued by the other Federal agencies, and amend HUD's existing regulations to:
Define the following terms to distinguish between ""direct"" and ""indirect"" Federal financial assistance in applying the rule: direct Federal financial assistance, Federal financial assistance, and indirect Federal financial assistance; State that decisions about awards of Federal financial assistance must be free from political interference or even the appearance of such interference and must be made on the basis of merit, not on the basis of religion or religious belief; Replace the term ""inherently religious activities"" with the term ""explicitly religious activities,"" and define the latter term to include ""activities that involve overt religious content such as worship, religious instruction, or proselytization;"" Explain the responsibilities of intermediaries and define the term ""intermediary;"" Require faith-based organizations that receive direct Federal financial assistance from HUD to carry out activities under a HUD program to provide written notice to beneficiaries and prospective beneficiaries describing certain religious liberty protections available to them; and Describe the steps that must be taken to refer a beneficiary to an alternative provider when the beneficiary objects to the religious character of an organization carrying out activities under a HUD-funded program.

• State that decisions about awards of Federal financial assistance must be free from political interference or even the appearance of such interference and must be made on the basis of merit, not on the basis of religion or religious belief;
• Replace the term ""inherently religious activities"" with the term ""explicitly religious activities,"" and define the latter term to include ""activities that involve overt religious content such as worship, religious instruction, or proselytization;""
• Explain the responsibilities of intermediaries and define the term ""intermediary;""
• Require faith-based organizations that receive direct Federal financial assistance from HUD to carry out activities under a HUD program to provide written notice to beneficiaries and prospective beneficiaries describing certain religious liberty protections available to them; and
• Describe the steps that must be taken to refer a beneficiary to an alternative provider when the beneficiary objects to the religious character of an organization carrying out activities under a HUD-funded program.
HUD has submitted its proposed rule for publication in the Federal Register. The general public will have sixty (60) days from the date of publication to submit comments on the proposed rule. HUD encourages interested persons to submit comments electronically through the Federal eRulemaking Portal at www.regulations.gov during the public comment period. The complete proposed rule can be viewed here (https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2015-18258.pdf)."
08/07/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-103.cfm,HUD Awards $8.9 Million in Community Development Block Grant Disaster Relief Funds to the City of Detroit,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Julián Castro, Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, U.S. Senators Debbie Stabenow and Gary C. Peters, and Congressman John Conyers, Jr., announced the allocation of $8.9 million from the Community Development Block Grant Declared Disaster Recovery Fund (DDR) to the City of Detroit. The funds will help Detroit become better prepared for future floods and other natural disasters, and assist with planning and implementation costs associated with resilient projects in the Brightmoor, Mt. Elliot and McDougall-Hunt neighborhoods, stemming from August 2014 flooding damage.
""This investment in Detroit, its people and its future will produce economic and environmental benefits for generations to come,"" said HUD Secretary Castro. ""Working with our local partners, we must continue to ensure that these communities are stronger than ever before with sustainable development and inclusive growth.""
""We are deeply appreciative to Secretary Castro and HUD for making this special allocation to the city of Detroit,"" said Detroit Mayor, Mike Duggan. ""With this funding, we are going to be able to make an impact in our neighborhoods through additional blight removal, beautification of vacant land and new strategies to make us more resilient to the kind of flood damage we experienced a year ago.""
The Detroit metropolitan area experienced significant flooding as a result of rainfall during the period of August 11-13, 2014. The City of Detroit had the highest number of affected households, with nearly 60,000 households suffering some level of housing damage. The severe weather and flooding also impacted Detroit's overall economy, damaging and disrupting critical manufacturing and freight operations as well as small businesses.
The storm resulted in over 10 billion gallons of combined sewer overflow, with 6 billion gallons of the flow coming from Detroit's system, which serves more than 70 communities in southeast Michigan. Of that overflow, nearly 80% was not treated, which threatened the overall health of the Great Lakes water system and Metro Detroit's water supply.
The DDR funds will demonstrate how green and blue infrastructure place making strategies help create new urban landscapes that improve civic life and promote significant citywide infrastructure renewal. The DDR funds will specifically help fund the following projects:
Brightmoor Green Infrastructure: This project will utilize land in a largely vacant area to manage stormwater flows to reduce sewer overflows. A variety of project types are envisioned for this area including green streets, public facility improvements, and urban agriculture. Mt. Elliot Neighborhood Renewable Power: Through this project, the city will work with a community partnership to complete pre-development work on a large scale solar panel array along a former railway on the near east side. These productive re-uses of vacant land will also encourage new housing and economic development investments. McDougall-Hunt Green Infrastructure: This project will provide storm water management by creating multi-functional green and blue infrastructure space accessible to the public. This project also aims to promote economic development by spurring housing and commercial development. The City will demolish vacant properties and undertake landscape installations in areas such as Aviation Sub and Islandview which are adjacent to the neighborhoods that experienced flooding or caused other areas to flood. These actions will promote increased absorption of stormwater which will help prevent future flooding.

""The better management of storm water will improve the health and safety of residents and support economic development in Southeast Michigan.""
""Today's announcement is a positive step forward to help the City of Detroit and its residents get back on their feet as the metro area continues to recover from last year's devastating storms and flooding,"" said Senator Gary Peters. ""The projects in Brightmoor, Mount Elliot and McDougall-Hunt will make critical upgrades to improve the management of storm water to prevent damage from future flooding and promote better sustainability. I'm proud to help announce these important investments in the City of Detroit that will continue to build a stronger Detroit and a stronger Michigan.""
""I want to applaud HUD and Secretary Castro for working with us to help make Detroit a cleaner, safer, and more livable city,"" said Congressman John Conyers, Jr. ""Detroiters can sleep better knowing we are making the necessary investments to protect Detroit families and our Great Lakes from the harmful impact of flooding.""
""Today's announcement reflects the strong partnership among federal, state and city officials. Under Mayor Duggan's leadership, Detroit is on its way to realizing his vision as a true comeback city,"" said Cliff Kellogg, Executive Director of the White House Detroit Federal Working Group.
In accordance with Section 106(c)(4) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, the HUD Secretary can use CDBG funds that have been recaptured pursuant to CDBG program sanctions for the purpose of addressing recovery efforts from major disasters. It also indicates that HUD shall make these funds available to metropolitan cities and urban counties located or partially located in areas affected by major disasters declared pursuant to the Stafford Act, and shall give priority to providing emergency assistance. HUD may also provide assistance to a metro city or urban county if they have been covered by a major declared disaster for which the declaration occurred in the past three years. FEMA issued a major disaster declaration for the Detroit metropolitan area on September 25, 2014."
08/10/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-102.cfm,HUD's Mortgagee Review Board Takes Action Against Two Texas Lenders,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Mortgagee Review Board (MRB) today announced settlement agreements with two Texas mortgage lenders following allegations they engaged in a scheme to charge bogus fees to consumers, which improperly inflated mortgages for borrowers purchasing newly constructed manufactured housing.
Among 11 alleged violations of Federal Housing Administration (FHA) rules, the MRB claimed American Home Free Mortgage, LLC (AHFM) of Prosper, Texas, artificially increased mortgage costs by an average of $12,000 per loan through illegitimate fees paid to a company owned and operated by its sales manager. In addition, HUD alleged that there were multiple quality control and annual certification violations.
As part of the agreement announced today, AHFM agreed to pay a civil money penalty in the amount of $169,419 and agreed to the permanent withdraw of its FHA approval. AHFM did not admit fault or liability with respect to HUD's allegations.
""FHA-approved lenders are obliged to apply our underwriting standards, not only to protect our insurance fund, but to make certain families can sustain their mortgages,"" said Helen Kanovsky, HUD's General Counsel. ""Lenders who engage in business practices that do not conform to generally accepted standards or who act irresponsibly will not be tolerated.""
In June 2014, the Mortgagee Review Board heard a similar case against R.H. Lending, Inc.,(""RHL""), of Colleyville, Texas. The Board considered multiple underwriting violations by RHL of manufactured home loans. RHL agreed to pay civil money penalties in the amount of $300,000 and to the permanent withdrawal of its FHA approval. In this case, HUD alleged that the lender had taken part in a scheme to disguise fees charged to borrowers as legitimate construction fees, but for which no work was performed, thus creating an inflated mortgage for the borrowers and increasing FHA's exposure to loss. RHL did not admit fault or liability. In addition, HUD debarred two of the principal actors in the RHL scheme from doing business with the Federal Government for a period of seven years.
The Mortgagee Review Board considers evidence brought against FHA-approved lenders for violations of the agency's program requirements. For serious violations, the Board can withdraw a lender's FHA approval so that the lender cannot participate in FHA programs. In less serious cases, the Board enters into settlement agreements with lenders to bring them into compliance. The Board can also impose civil money penalties, enter into settlements with administrative payments, place lenders on probation, suspend their FHA approval, or issue letters of reprimand."
08/13/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-105.cfm,Enterprise and HUD Release National Emergency Preparedness Toolkit for Multifamily Housing,"NEW YORK - Enterprise Community Partners Inc. (Enterprise), a national organization that creates and advocates for affordable housing in thriving communities, and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today released a national emergency preparedness staffing toolkit for multifamily housing. Enterprise and HUD developed Ready to Respond: Disaster Staffing Toolkit (www.enterprisecommunity.org/readytorespond) to help affordable housing organizations build emergency plans that promote business continuity, resident engagement and building protection. The toolkit is the first of its kind dedicated to multifamily housing emergency planning and will be disseminated across the U.S.
""The simple truth is we can no longer afford to be unprepared for the growing threat that climate change poses to local communities,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""This toolkit offers multifamily property owners what they need to better protect their developments and their residents. What we do today will put us on a more resilient path to weather the next disaster that will most surely come our way.""
""Hurricane Sandy showed affordable housing organizations the importance of disaster preparedness and maintaining continuity. Their residents are the most vulnerable, the least able to adapt in a crisis and the least likely to recover quickly and fully without support,"" said Terri Ludwig, president & CEO, Enterprise Community Partners, Inc. ""The Ready to Respond: Disaster Staffing Toolkit will help affordable housing organizations across the country better protect their residents, minimize the impact of emergencies and prepare and safeguard their buildings and staff.""
The Ready to Respond: Disaster Staffing Toolkitincorporates videos, guides, worksheets and checklists to help housing organizations assign staff to disaster response roles, engage in vital planning tasks, test the strength of their plan with a simulated disaster scenario and perform ongoing maintenance. Developed in partnership with 12 leading community development corporations (CDCs) from around New York and New Jersey as part of the Enterprise Recovery and Rebuilding program, the toolkit is based on the Incident Command System (ICS), a planning framework used by federal, state and local first responder agencies to help structure command, control and coordination of emergency responses. The use of ICS will allow multifamily housing organizations and CDCs to communicate clearly with first responder agencies.
""Having experienced the devastating effects of Hurricane Sandy, JCHA understands the critical role that tools like Ready to Respond: Disaster Staffing Toolkit can play in minimizing damage to important sources of affordable housing and communities,"" said Marvin Walton, executive director, Jersey City Housing Authority. ""Since the storm, JCHA has remained committed to ensuring that our buildings are prepared to manage future disasters by developing a comprehensive emergency plan, staff training programs and retrofitting our most flood-vulnerable buildings. We are proud to have provided useful insight for the creation of this toolkit and help other organizations be better prepared for disasters.""
The toolkit is part of a larger package called Ready to Respond: Tools for Resilience that Enterprise created to help affordable housing organizations of all sizes manage shocks from major disasters and develop the resilience needed to adapt to future emergencies. In addition to the staffing toolkit, Enterprise developed Are You Ready to Respond?, an organizational self-assessment for emergency readiness, and Ready to Respond: Strategies for Multifamily Building Resilience, a set of 20 retrofit strategies that building owners can implement to make their properties more resilient against climate hazards, which is set for release on the third anniversary of Hurricane Sandy.
To coincide with the launch of the toolkit, Enterprise will host Ready to Respond: An Overview of Enterprise’s Disaster Staffing Toolkit (https://enterprisecommunity.webex.com/mw0401lsp13/mywebex/default.do?nomenu=true&siteurl= enterprisecommunity&service=6&rnd=0.4131169706143383&main_url=https%3A%2F%2F enterprisecommunity.webex.com%2Fec0701lsp13%2Feventcenter%2Fevent%2FeventAction.do%3FtheAction %3Ddetail%26confViewID%3D4148954768%26%26EMK%3D4832534b000000028dded7fc509790ca9829420ca2da2c42b 479204c18a6d533ff125b5732352c4e%26%26encryptTicket%3DSDJTSwAAAAIJ8Eyt8h_lm-4hOvvutgBpXbqgA9xuzhvO 5un7iIeoSg2%26%26siteurl%3Denterprisecommunity) on August 14, 2015 from 2:00 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. (ET). This Live Online Event will guide affordable housing owners and operators, housing directors, asset managers and those interested in disaster preparedness planning on the overall structure of the Toolkit, the importance of the Emergency Preparedness Coordinator (EPC), and how to understand the Disaster Response Roles and the tools to help them succeed. Additional Live Online Events (www.enterprisecommunity.com/knowledge-central/live-online-events) will be held on September 8, 10, 17 and 22 and October 6, 13, 15, 20, 21, 27 and 28.

08/13/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-106.cfm,HUD Launches Resource Locator App,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today unveiled the HUD Resource Locator - an innovative mobile app and website to further expand and enhance traditional HUD customer service. The resource locator will offer real-time HUD housing information at the fingertips of people looking to quickly connect with building managers, public housing authority representatives, and property management companies to inquire about housing availability and other housing-related questions.
The HUD resource locator is one of several services provided by HUD's Enterprise Geographic Information System (eGIS). This tool uses GIS technology to pinpoint where resources are located and allow anyone with a smartphone or tablet to get relevant contact information. For example, the new app can be used during a disaster when families need to find housing, or when social service providers are helping persons experiencing homelessness look for available housing assistance. In an era where people are increasingly using smartphones to find information, the HUD resource locator app and mobile site provides an easy tool for anyone to use to find housing resources.The resource locator uses housing data from HUD and the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
""The HUD Resource Locator app delivers real-time HUD housing information at the touch of a button,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""In today's global economy where more and more people have a smartphones or similar devices, HUD is committed to finding ways to make it easier for Americans to access our resources and find opportunities to move ahead.""
The HUD Resource Locator is a mobile app and mobile website that includes:

08/17/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-107.cfm,FHA Announces New Lender Performance Measure to Expand Credit Access to More Eligible Borrowers,"WASHINGTON - The Federal Housing Administration today announced a new method for evaluating the lending practices of FHA-approved lenders and understanding the sorts of borrowers they are serving. FHA's new Supplemental Performance Metric will complement the agency's existing 'compare ratio' and offer more nuanced insight into a lender's specific performance while encouraging lenders to serve eligible underserved borrowers.
The new supplemental performance metric will help FHA lenders see the impact of their business at all ends of the credit spectrum in line with FHA's willingness to insure loans to eligible borrowers with lower credit scores.
""This is one more tool to help FHA, lenders, and the public, know exactly who we're serving,"" said Ed Golding, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Housing. ""By better understanding FHA's acceptable risk tolerance levels for a variety of credit scores, lenders will have the confidence to lend more broadly and FHA will have more data on how successful those lenders are.""
The Supplemental Performance Metric responds to lender concerns about the Compare Ratio being a comparison to one's peers rather than to FHA's risk tolerance. By measuring default rates and claims in three distinct credit bands, the metric compliments the Compare Ratio, providing a more granular, nuanced look at lender performance, with the added benefit of better understanding of who lenders are serving.
In the spring of 2014, FHA proposed the development of a Supplemental Performance Metric—one component of FHA's Blueprint for Access to Credit initiative, an effort to expand access to mortgage credit to underserved borrowers. Effective by the end of the July 2015, this new complementary metric will be available in FHA's Neighborhood Watch Early Warning System. The new metric is designed to help mitigate adverse selection of borrowers with certain credit profiles and encourage the extension of homeownership opportunities to underserved segments of the market.
FHA currently calculates a 'Compare Ratio' for all FHA-approved lenders. This ratio compares a lender's rate of early defaults and claims for insured single family mortgage loans to other approved lenders in a geographic area. Compare ratios are used to identifylenders with excessive default and claim rates compared to their peers and which lenders FHA may terminate."
08/18/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-108.cfm,Hurricane Katrina: Ten Years of Recovery in the Gulf,"WASHINGTON - On August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina slammed into the Gulf Coast of the United States, forcing more than a million people from their homes and tragically taking more than 1,800 lives. Katrina remains the most devastating and costliest natural disaster in our nation's history. Today, U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Julián Castro and a team of recovery experts briefed reporters on the progress of long-term disaster recovery efforts and the lessons learned over the past decade. Read Hurricane Katrina: By the Numbers.
""The road to recovery has been long and not without serious challenges, but it's also shown that though the storm was strong, the resilient spirit of the Gulf Coast was even stronger,"" Secretary Castro said. ""And as long as there are people who want to come home and communities that need to be rebuilt our job is not done.""
Over the last 10 years, HUD investments have had a major impact on the recovery in the Gulf region. Working closely with state disaster recovery leaders in Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, Alabama and Florida, HUD's allocated nearly $20 billion through the Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) Program. This funding greatly contributed to long-term recovery of the region's housing stock, economy, and infrastructure.
Housing: More than $14 billion in HUD recovery funds supported State-run housing programs:
158,000 households received direct compensation for their economic loss 2,894 families received help to purchase homes 12,660 rehabilitated/reconstructed housing units 767 newly constructed housing units 35,597 affordable rental housing units
• 158,000 households received direct compensation for their economic loss
• 2,894 families received help to purchase homes
• 12,660 rehabilitated/reconstructed housing units
• 767 newly constructed housing units
• 35,597 affordable rental housing units
Infrastructure: Using CDBG-DR funds, States invested a combined $1.6 Billion to replace/improve streets, utilities, sewer lines, schools, hospitals dikes and dams. For example, the State of Louisiana used HUD investments to construct or rehabilitate:
82 new schools 11 higher education facilities 13 healthcare facilities (including the redevelopment of former Charity, Methodist and VA Hospitals in New Orleans). 20 parks and recreational facilities 52 water and sewer projects 22 fisheries in nine coastal parishes
• 82 new schools
• 11 higher education facilities
• 13 healthcare facilities (including the redevelopment of former Charity, Methodist and VA Hospitals in New Orleans).
• 20 parks and recreational facilities
• 52 water and sewer projects
• 22 fisheries in nine coastal parishes
Economic Development: CDBG-DR funds helped thousands of businesses responsible for creating and retaining thousands of jobs in the Gulf Region. Through a variety of programs, its estimated HUD funds assisted nearly 5,500 businesses, creating 6,500 permanent jobs. This assistance helped to sustain Gulf Coast economies during the more recent economic downturn as well as the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010.
Public Housing in New Orleans: HUD was critical in the redevelopment of damaged public housing throughout the Gulf, most notably New Orleans' 'Big Four' developments (formerly known as C.J. Peete, B.W. Cooper, Lafitte, and St. Bernard). Hurricane Katrina displaced 3,000 families living in those developments. Today, four new attractive, mixed-income developments are a vital part of community life in New Orleans. In fact, the Housing Authority of New Orleans (HANO) is serving significantly more households than before the storm. HANO is housing or providing rental assistance to 20,000 households (compared to 14,000 in 2005).
HUD's Disaster Housing Assistance Program (DHAP) provided stable housing for tens of thousands of families forced from their homes. HUD partnered with 306 Public Housing Authorities in 49 states to find temporary affordable rental housing for displaced households to allow them sufficient time to return to their own homes. By the time this program ended in 2009, HUD helped house nearly 37,000 families.
Fair Housing: HUD has prioritized fair housing and economic opportunity throughout redevelopment. Working with its Gulf Coast partners employed strong fair housing enforcement and economic opportunity requirements to overcome fair housing and economic barriers in the following ways:
To ensure HUD-funded redevelopment offers job opportunities for low-income residents To challenging discriminatory rental policies that closed the door to families seeking to return to their communities; and To help develop housing that can be storm-resilient and accessible for people with physical disabilities.

08/18/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-109.cfm,HUD and Census Bureau Announce New Residential Construction Activity in July,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Census Bureau jointly announced the following new residential construction statistics for July 2015:
BUILDING PERMITS
Privately owned housing units authorized by building permits in July were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,119,000. This is 16.3 percent (±1.1%) below the revised June rate of 1,337,000, and is 7.5 percent (±2.3%) above the July 2014 estimate of 1,041,000. Single-family authorizations in July were at a rate of 679,000; this is 1.9 percent (±1.0%) below the revised June figure of 692,000. Authorizations of units in buildings with five units or more were at a rate of 412,000 in July.
HOUSING STARTS
Privately owned housing starts in July were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,206,000. This is 0.2 percent (±15.2%)* above the revised June estimate of 1,204,000 and is 10.1 percent (±10.8%)* above the July 2014 rate of 1,095,000.

New Residential Construction data for August 2015 will be released on Thursday, September 17, 2015, at 8:30 A.M. EDT.
EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take two months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, 4 months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2%) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90-percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised about three percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found on our web site listed above.
* 90% confidence interval includes zero. The Census Bureau does not have sufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero.

08/19/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-110.cfm,HUD Awards More Than $26 Million to St. Louis County to Boost Economic Growth and Revitalize Distressed Communities,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Julián Castro announced Wednesday the allocation of more than $26 million from the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program for St. Louis County, Missouri. St. Louis County received $24 million under the Section 108 Loan Guarantee Program to establish a loan pool for community development projects, while an additional $2.4 million in Declared Disaster Recovery Funds was awarded to the North County area of St. Louis County to help communities impacted by tornadoes and severe storms in 2013.
""Today's announcement reflects a simple truth: we believe in this area, its people and its future,"" said Secretary Julián Castro. ""This is flexible funding that will be used to improve housing, support entrepreneurship, increase transit options and strengthen communities in St. Louis County.""
""Secretary Castro and his staff have demonstrated a strong commitment to improve the lives of people in St. Louis County,"" said County Executive Steve Stenger. ""The Section 108 Loan Guarantee Program and the Community Development Block Grant money will advance our mission to address poverty and disparity.""
Section 108 Loan Guarantee program
Under HUD's Section 108 Loan Guarantee Program, St. Louis County will be able to fund transit-oriented development; mixed-use commercial, retail and multi-family rental development; business development loans; and public infrastructure and facilities, including collaborative projects that cross municipal borders.
The Section 108 loan guarantee program allows local governments to transform a small portion of their CDBG funds into federally guaranteed loans to spur economic revitalization projects. Local governments borrowing funds guaranteed by HUD through the Section 108 program must pledge their current and future CDBG allocations as security for the loan.
Declared Disaster Recovery Fund
On July 18, 2013, FEMA issued a major disaster declaration (4130-DR) that covered 27 counties in the State of Missouri, including St. Louis County. The disaster involved an EF-3 tornado that impacted a 32-mile area, primarily in St. Louis County. The tornado and associated severe weather damaged numerous small businesses and disrupted the Lambert-St. Louis International Airport for over two weeks."
08/20/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-111.cfm,HUD Releases Rule Clarifying the Requirements for Relocation of Housing Choice Voucher Participants,"WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development released the final rulethat clarifies the portability regulations and requirements in the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program and helps improve the processing of portability requests. Portability refers to a feature of the HCV program that allows an eligible family with a housing choice voucher to use that voucher to lease a unit anywhere in the United States where there is a public housing agency (PHA) operating an HCV program. The new Portability Rule will help increase administrative efficiencies by eliminating confusing and obscure regulatory language, and balancing the needs of PHA's while increasing family choice.
HUD originally published the proposed rule in the Federal Register on March 28, 2012 (https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2012/03/28/2012-7341/public-housing-and-section-8-programs-housing-choice-voucher-program-streamlining-the-portability). Following a public comment process, publication of the final portability rule concludes the rulemaking process. It is expected that the clarity afforded by this final rule will improve the portability process, and that the rule will allow families to more easily search for and lease a rental unit in their desired location.
The Portability Rule provides clarification in the following areas:
Family briefings:The final rule requires that all families be provided an explanation of potential housing opportunities in areas with low concentration of low-income families, not just housing in high-poverty census tracts. It also requires PHAs to explain how portability works to all families, not just those who are eligible to move under portability.
• Family briefings:The final rule requires that all families be provided an explanation of potential housing opportunities in areas with low concentration of low-income families, not just housing in high-poverty census tracts. It also requires PHAs to explain how portability works to all families, not just those who are eligible to move under portability.
The final rule also requires information be provided on how portability may affect their assistance through rescreening, changes in subsidy standards and payment standards, and any other elements of the portability process which may affect the family's assistance.
Additionally, the final rule requires that information about the factors the family should consider when determining where to lease a unit with voucher assistance be provided as part of the briefing only if HUD makes such information available to PHAs for distribution.
List of landlords:The final rule retains the requirement to provide, as part of the information packet given to the family, a list of landlords known to the PHA who may be willing to lease a unit to the family. Additionally, it expands the current regulatory language by replacing the current reference to ""other parties known to the PHA"" for ""other resources (such as newspapers, organizations and online search tools) known to the PHA."" The final rule further provides that thelist of landlords or other resources covers areas outside of poverty or minority concentration. Administrative Fees:The final rule changes the administrative fee structure so that the amount of administrative fees a receiving PHA may bill for a portable voucher cannot exceed 100% of its own administrative fee rate. Under the new administrative fee structure, the initial PHA continues to keep a percentage of the administrative fee, and the receiving PHA does not bill for an amount that is higher than its own administrative fee. Mandatory voucher suspension:The final rule requires temporarily pausing the voucher's term when a family submits a request for tenancy approval to the PHA and restarting it when the PHA notifies the family in writing whether the request has been approved or denied. This provision applies to all families that are in the process of leasing a unit (not just families that are porting). Mandatory voucher suspension is intended to prevent the expiration of the family's search time while the PHA performs the administrative tasks required for a new request for tenancy. Receiving PHA voucher expiration:The final rule grants families 30 additional calendar days from the expiration date of the initial voucher to cover the time it takes to complete the portability process. Family chooses receiving PHA:The final rule allows a family to choose the receiving PHA that will administer its voucher, if there is more than one PHA that manages an HCV program in the family's new location. A family may request that the initial PHA chooses the receiving PHA for them, if that is their preference.
• List of landlords:The final rule retains the requirement to provide, as part of the information packet given to the family, a list of landlords known to the PHA who may be willing to lease a unit to the family.

08/24/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-112.cfm,Obama Administration to Provide Guidance for Financing Renewable Energy Upgrades in Single Family Homes,"WASHINGTON - As part of the White House's National Clean Energy Summit, the Obama Administration and the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) announced its intent to issue a set of guidelines supporting borrowers seeking to make energy efficient improvements to their homes. In today's announcement, FHA expressed the intent to allow borrowers to use Single Family FHA financing for properties with existing Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) loans that meet certain conditions.
""These new tools will help homeowners make smart choices for their pocketbooks and for the environment,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""HUD and the Obama Administration are proud to invest in American families and in the future of our planet.""
In 2009 and 2010, many states adopted legislation allowing local governments to implement PACE programs using their (tax) assessment authority. PACE can vary from state-to-state, but generally allows homeowners to finance energy efficiency improvements for up to 20 years through assessments attached to the property. PACE allows homeowners to benefit from the improvements immediately and spread the cost over time. When the property is sold, the PACE loan remains with the property and the next owner is responsible for repaying the loan.
The Single Family FHA guidance will allow lenders to evaluate the conditions under which borrowers purchasing, refinancing properties, or modifying their loans with existing PACE assessments will be eligible to use FHA-insured financing. Through this guidance FHA is committing to develop more specific guidance in the near future that will include the following requirements:
PACE liens that preserve payment priority for first lien mortgages through subordination are eligible; PACE assessments must be fixed-rate and fixed repayment schedule; PACE assessments must be recorded and identifiable to the lender; and PACE assessments must be attached to single family properties, as defined by FHA, which are 1- to 4 unit dwellings.
• PACE liens that preserve payment priority for first lien mortgages through subordination are eligible;
• PACE assessments must be fixed-rate and fixed repayment schedule;
• PACE assessments must be recorded and identifiable to the lender; and
• PACE assessments must be attached to single family properties, as defined by FHA, which are 1- to 4 unit dwellings.
Additionally, to support efforts to provide potential homeowners with an easy way to measure the energy efficiency of their homes and to benefit from the associated cost savings, FHA also announced a new partnership with the Department of Energy (DOE) that will incorporate the use of DOE's Home Energy Score into Single Family existing FHA's Energy Efficient Home (EEH) program. Under the new FHA and DOE partnership, FHA will provide flexible underwriting to recognize the reduced costs of utilities when those costs are established with the Department of Energy's (DOE) Home Energy Score.
Homebuyers or homeowners who want to obtain an FHA-insured purchase or refinance mortgage for a single family home that receives a Home Energy Score of 6 or higher will be eligible to increase their income qualifying ratio by 2% above the standard Single Family FHA limit.
DOE developed the Home Energy Score as a low-cost, reliable method to estimate a home's energy use. It is the equivalent of a vehicle miles-per-gallon rating for homes. The calculation methodology relies on a 10-point scale in which a ""1"" corresponds to the least energy efficient homes and a ""10"" corresponds to the most energy efficient homes. According to DOE, the average U.S. home will score a ""5."" The official DOE-recognized Home Energy Score can only be assessed by a qualified energy assessor.

08/24/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-113.cfm,HUD Offers $9 Million to Provide Stable Housing to Low-Income Victims of Domestic Violence Living with HIV/AIDS,"WASHINGTON - To help prevent victims of domestic violence living with HIV/AIDS from falling into homelessness, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development is making more than $9 million available to state, local governments and non-profits through the VAWA/HOPWA Project Demonstration - a collaborative effort between HUD's Office of HIVAIDS Housing (OHH) and the Department of Justice's Office of Violence Against Women (OVW). More than half of women living with HIV/AIDS in the U.S. do not have access to stable housing and are at higher risk of experiencing domestic violence. Read HUD's Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) (www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=278647).
Through this demonstration program, HUD will provide funding for transitional and other temporary rental housing assistance and supportive services to low-income persons living with HIV/AIDS who are victims of sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, or stalking. Grantees will be required to partner with local domestic violence and sexual assault service providers for client outreach and engagement and for comprehensive supportive services to ensure client success in the program.
""Every American deserves to live in a safe and stable environment,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""This funding will help vulnerable populations with HIV/AIDS to break the cycle of domestic violence and get the help they need.""
""We understand that HIV and domestic violence are both challenging issues and it is a great opportunity for HUD to collaborate with DOJ to focus on their intersection,"" said Ann Oliva, HUD's Deputy Assistant Secretary for Special Needs. ""It is important for us to find partners who help us be strategic in getting the resources to the people they may not be currently reaching.""
This demonstration follows a recommendation by the Federal Interagency Working Group on the Intersection of HIV/AIDS, Violence against Women and Girls, and Gender-Related Health Disparities to enhance Federal efforts in addressing HIV and intimate partner violence (IPV) among homeless and marginally housed women and girls. While the Working Group focuses on women and girls, the housing assistance and supportive services provided through the demonstration will be open to all eligible clients regardless of sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, familial status, marital status, race, color, religion, national origin, disability, or age.
OHH and OVW have collaborated to identify available resources to support this demonstration. OVW identified over $1.4 million from the Transitional Housing Assistance Grants for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Stalking or Sexual Assault Program. OVW and OHH executed an Interagency Agreement assigning HUD to administer the Transitional Housing Assistance Program grant funds. OHH has identified over $7.6 million in HOPWA funding that will be used to fund housing assistance for program beneficiaries, coordination and planning activities, and grant management and administration.
HUD will hold a pre-application webcast on September 8, 2015 from 2:00-3:30 pm EDT for anyone who is interested in submitting an application for the VAWA/HOPWA Project Demonstration. The webcast will cover the information in the NOFA. More information on the webcast will be provided through the HOPWA mailing list. To sign up for the mailing list, please visit HUD's website (https://www.hudexchange.info/mailinglist/).
The HOPWA program is the only Federal program dedicated to addressing the housing needs of persons living with HIV/AIDS and their families. Grantees partner with nonprofit organizations and housing agencies to provide housing and support to program beneficiaries."
08/24/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-113a.cfm,HUD Provides Clarity for Louisiana's Road Home Elevation Incentive Program,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced it has worked with the State of Louisiana on a series of proposed amendments to its Road Home Elevation Incentive Program to provide certain homeowners relief from having to pay back funds intended to help elevate their homes. Under this approach, the State of Louisiana will identify qualified homeowners who used their elevation grants to rehabilitate their homes or for interim housing expenses. If any of the estimated 16,000 homeowners can demonstrate to the State that their elevation grants were used for remaining unmet housing needs, HUD will no longer hold the State liable for repayment.
In 2013, HUD's Office of the Inspector General (OIG) issued a report on Louisiana's Road Home Elevation Incentive Program (RHEI) which found widespread noncompliance among a sampling of cases. HUD's OIG recommended HUD determine the scale of this noncompliance and consider requiring the State to recover funds from homeowners who received elevation incentive payments, but have yet to elevate their homes. HUD has been working with State officials over the past two years to address these issues.
""We believe there are a significant number of responsible homeowners who participated in this program in good faith but ultimately lacked sufficient resources to repair their damaged homes,"" said Harriet Tregoning, HUD's Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development. ""We won't victimize people who made an honest effort to do the right thing. We intend to work very closely with our Inspector General and the State to overcome the original design flaws in this program to further housing recovery in Louisiana. We are pleased to see that the State is committed to finishing the job for homeowners whose properties still need to be elevated and made more resilient to future storms.""
The Road Home Elevation Incentive Program:
HUD allocated to Louisiana a total of $13.4 billion through its Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) Program to support the long-term recovery in the State following Hurricane Katrina. Using these funds, the State established multiple recovery programs, including the RHEI Program. This incentive program was intended to encourage qualified homeowners living in high-risk areas to elevate their homes to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) base flood elevation standards by offering grants of up to $30,000. In return, participating homeowners signed a covenant to elevate their home to these standards and to reside in the home for at least three years. The grants were provided as an incentive to elevate and were never expected to be enough to cover the full cost of elevation in all cases; however, many homeowners were unable to secure private financing or other funds to fill the gap.
Following the Inspector General's report, the State of Louisiana estimated that approximately 16,000 households who received elevation incentive payments did not elevate their homes. The majority of these households were lower income or senior citizens who did not have sufficient resources to either rehabilitate their homes or to elevate them, and many appear to have chosen to apply their elevation grants toward the repairs to their properties or interim living expenses while rebuilding.
To overcome this design flaw and to address the concerns expressed by the Office of the Inspector General, HUD is now requiring the State to perform on-site inspections to verify how noncompliant households actually spent their elevation grants. If the State can determine that these households used the funds to repair their properties or to sustain themselves in rental housing, HUD will consider these households compliant with the overarching policy goals of long-term recovery, and they will not have to repay their elevation grants."
08/27/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-104.cfm,HUD Awards $101 Million to Protect Children and Families from Dangerous Lead and Other Home Hazards,"WASHINGTON - In an effort to protect children and families from potentially dangerous lead-based paint and other health and safety hazards, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has awarded over $101 million to 32 city, county and state governments. The grant funding announced will reduce the number of lead-poisoned children and protect families by targeting health hazards in over 6,000 low-income homes with significant lead and/or other home health and safety hazards (see chart below). Read a summary of each of the grants announced today.
Earlier this week in Baltimore, MD, HUD Secretary Julián Castro announced the funding during a news conference with Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake as part of the Green & Healthy Homes Initiative Back to School event, promoting healthier housing to improve school outcomes. The City of Baltimore is one of the grantees.
HUD's Lead Hazard Control grant programs has a demonstrated history of success, filling critical needs in urban communities where no other resources exist to address substandard housing that threatens the health of the most vulnerable residents.
As HUD marks its 50th anniversary, Secretary Castro is focused on advancing policies that create opportunities for all Americans, including helping children and families secure quality housing by protecting them from the hazards of lead-based paint and other home health and safety hazards.
""Every family deserves to live in a safe and healthy home where they can see their children thrive and excel,"" said Castro. ""Communities will use these grants to help eliminate home-related hazards in neighborhoods across the country. A healthy home is vital to the American Dream.""
""Millions of families and children are seeing their hope for the future threatened by poor healthsimply because of where they live,"" noted Matthew E. Ammon, Director of HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes. ""While we've made tremendous progress reducing lead-based paint hazards in our older housing stock, far too many children continue to be exposed to potentially dangerous lead and other health hazards in the home.""
Unsafe and unhealthy homes affect the health of millions of people of all income levels, geographic areas, and walks of life in the U.S. These unsafe and unhealthy homes affect the economy directly, through increased utilization of health care services, and indirectly through lost wages and increased school days missed. Housing improvements help prevent injuries and illnesses, reduce associated health care and social services costs, reduce absentee rates for children in school and adults at work, and reduce stress, all which help to improve the quality of life.
HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes promotes local efforts to eliminate dangerous lead paint and other housing-related health hazards from lower income homes; stimulate private sector investment in lead hazard control; support cutting-edge research on methods for assessing and controlling housing-related health and safety hazards; and educate the public about the dangers of hazards in the home.
The funding announced here directs critical funds to cities, counties and states to eliminate dangerous lead paint and other housing-related health hazards in thousands of privately-owned, low-income housing units. HUD is also providing the grantees over $8.8 million in Healthy Homes supplemental funding to help communities mitigate multiple health hazards in high risk housing simultaneously,in conjunction with their lead hazard control activities.

09/16/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-114.cfm,HUD Announces Relief for Victims of Hurricane Sandy,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today decided that HUD will not force thousands of New York and New Jersey homeowners to repay federal disaster recovery funds following a decision by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to increase flood insurance claim payments to families it initially underpaid following Hurricane Sandy.
Federal law provides HUD the discretion to weigh the real-world recovery challenges faced by many of these families against another legal requirement that prohibits any federal 'duplication of benefits.'
Today, Harriet Tregoning, HUD's Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development, informed state and local leaders in the Sandy-impacted region that additional flood insurance proceeds up to $20,000 will not be subject to a duplication of benefits review or collection. This will eliminate the need for HUD grantees to reclaim assistance from these households, or to repay those funds through non-federal sources. To date, 3-out-of-4 National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) claimants received less than $20,000 in additional compensation from FEMA and would not face any possible repayment.
Families who received/will receive more than $20,000 in additional flood insurance payments will still have the opportunity to demonstrate the added claim payments address legitimate unmet needs and therefore are not duplicative.
""These families have suffered enough and shouldn't be further victimized through no fault of their own,"" said Tregoning. ""We have a larger responsibility to facilitate recovery, not to hinder it just because these families didn't receive sufficient flood insurance payments.""
HUD determined that below $20,000, any benefit gained by going through a protracted process of reexamining and documenting costs incurred by homeowners would not outweigh the larger financial and human costs associated with doing so. For those NFIP policyholders who receive more than $20,000 in additional claim payments, HUD will require its grantees (primarily New York State, New York City, and the State of New Jersey) to determine whether any amount over $20,000 duplicates federal assistance already provided.
Background:
On October 29th, 2012, Hurricane Sandy devastated the East Coast of the United States, damaging or destroying 650,000 homes and generating nearly 145,000 claims from homeowners to FEMA's National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). Thousands of these policyholders received insufficient flood insurance payments due to alleged fraud on the part of FEMA contractors charged with determining damage payouts. FEMA invited homeowners to appeal their claim payments which resulted (and will continue to result) in additional flood insurance payments.
The Stafford Act requires the Federal Government and its state and local grantees to assure that any Federal assistance deemed duplicative to be repaid. Prior to the decision announced today, many public leaders and homeowners alike expressed concerns that any additional FEMA flood insurance payments would trigger the law's prohibition against duplication of benefits. However, the Act also gives HUD's Secretary discretion in those cases where recovering any duplicated benefits would not be in the Federal Government's interest."

EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take two months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, 4 months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2%) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90-percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised about three percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found on our web site listed above.
* 90% confidence interval includes zero. The Census Bureau does not have sufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero.

09/18/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-116.cfm,HUD Makes $1.9 Billion in Grants Available for Homeless Programs,"WASHINGTON - As part of the Obama Administration's effort to prevent and effectively end homelessness, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced today that it will offer $1.9 billion for fiscal year 2015 to support existing and new homelessness programs. Funded through HUD's Continuum of Care (CoC) Homeless Assistance Program Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) (https://www.hudexchange.info/e-snaps/fy-2015-coc-program-nofa-coc-program-competition/), this notice will further incentivize local applicants to pursue permanent housing using a Housing First approach to target their resources to proven strategies.
The funding, for which the notice was published today, will provide permanent and transitional housing to people experiencing homelessness as well as services including housing stabilization, job training, and health care. Continuum of Care grants are awarded competitively to local programs to meet the needs of people experiencing homelessness. These grants fund a wide variety of programs from street outreach and assessment programs to transitional and permanent housing for individuals, including unaccompanied youth, and families.
For this CoC program competition, HUD has made several changes to the application process that will make it much more competitive and significantly increase incentives for communities to improve their performance. As part of these changes, HUD has expanded incentives to adopt best practices such as permanent supportive housing and rapid re-housing which will enable communities to further move the needle on ending homelessness.
Additionally, the CoC program NOFA encourages communities to end veteran, chronic, family, and youth homelessness as well as to use their data to allocate all resources available within the community to end homelessness. Finally, to help communities reach these goals, there is greater flexibility provided to create a variety of new projects that will allow recipients to serve different populations of individuals and families experiencing homelessness as well as to support increased data collection and analysis.
This competition is designed to promote proven strategies that have made a lasting impact on the local level,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""By empowering our partners with the resources, tools, and support that they need, we can move closer to the day when the United States ends homelessness — once and for all.""
In 2010, President Obama and 19 federal agencies and offices that form the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH) launched the nation's first comprehensive strategy to prevent and end homelessness. Opening Doors: Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness (www.usich.gov/opening_doors/) serves as a roadmap for how the federal government will work with state and local communities to confront the root causes of homelessness. Since Opening Doors was published, HUD's homeless assistance grants have reduced homelessness in America, including for veterans, families, and people experiencing long-term or chronic homelessness.
HUD requires prospective grantees to submit applications electronically at www.grants.gov. Any changes to HUD-published funding notices will be made available to the public through a Federal Register publication and published on this government-wide portal. Applicants are urged to sign up for Grants.gov's notification service to receive periodic updates or changes to these grant offerings."
09/21/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-117.cfm,HUD Awards $12.4 Million to 18 Tribes Nationwide to Address Mold in Native American and Alaska Native Communities,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today it has awarded $12.4 million to 18 tribal communities in 13 states to remove and prevent dangerous mold in more than 1,000 homes. This is the largest amount to date awarded by HUD for this purpose. The grants are being made available through HUD's Indian Community Development Block Grant (ICDBG) program, which addresses a wide variety of community development and affordable housing activities.
These grants will support mold remediation in housing owned or operated by tribes, tribally designated housing entities, or tribal organizations, with priority given to units with the most evidence of mold. (See chart below for list of winners.)
""Every family in America deserves a safe and healthy place to call home,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""These mold remediation grants demonstrate HUD's commitment to partnering with Native American communities to improve tribal housing and create healthy communities where families can thrive.""
All the grantees will address moisture issues by using construction materials and techniques known to resist mold, and ensuring that staff or contractors use safe practices for identifying and remediating mold. They will also educate residents on ways to prevent mold from reoccurring in the future.
For example, the Blackfeet Tribe in Montana will address mold problems in 16 homes with wooden construction, by building and sealing new concrete foundations in the homes, installing exterior drain systems and installing sump pumps. The White Earth Housing Authority in Minnesota will use its grant to repair 21 homes that were originally constructed without proper ventilation. It will also work with Indian Health Services and the tribe's own Natural Resources Department to prevent future mold problems. And the Yakutat Tlingit Tribe in Alaska will use its grant to assess and remediate mold in 20 units with priority given to elders, households with children, and tribal members with asthma. Many of the homes in this region were not designed for the damp, southeast Alaska climate but were prefabricated out of state.
The grant funding was first made available in Fiscal Year 2014 through a set-aside to remediate and prevent mold in housing units owned or operated by tribes and Tribally Designated Housing Entities. Last year, nine tribes received grants to remove unhealthy levels of mold, including the Havasupai Tribe in Arizona where mold is a common problem partly because of frequent flooding in low-lying areas of the Grand Canyon.
Established in 1977, HUD's ICDBG program assists Indian tribes and Alaska Native villages to meet their community development needs. Federally recognized Indian tribes, bands, groups or nations (including Alaska Indian, Aleuts and Eskimos,) Alaska Native villages, and eligible tribal organizations compete for this funding. A second more general round of ICDBG funding will be announced later this year.
HUD administers six programs that are specifically targeted to American Indian, Alaska Native, or native Hawaiian individuals and families, and federally recognized tribal governments. In Fiscal Year 2015 HUD received approximately $732 million to fund programs to support housing and development initiatives in American Indian, Alaska Native, and native Hawaiian communities. Through innovative programming, American Indian and Alaska Native tribal governments have created sustainable and community-driven solutions to their housing and community development challenges.

09/28/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-119.cfm,"HUD Awards Nearly $150 Million to Five Communities to Revitalize Housing, Surrounding Neighborhoods","WASHINGTON - U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Julián Castro traveled to Atlanta, Georgia and Kansas City, Missouri today to announce that five communities will receive a combined $150 million to redevelop severely distressed public housing and revitalize the surrounding neighborhood. HUD is awarding Choice Neighborhoods Initiative Implementation Grants to city and housing authority partnerships in Atlanta, Georgia; Kansas City, Missouri; Memphis, Tennessee; Milwaukee, Wisconsin and Sacramento, California; in order to begin the process of transforming, rehabilitating and preserving public housing.
As part of the Administration's overall drive to reinvest in neighborhoods of concentrated poverty, President Obama's Choice Neighborhoods Initiative is intended to transform distressed public and assisted housing into sustainable, mixed-income housing with access to community assets and services and to support positive outcomes for families living in the development and in the community. The five awardees have proposed to replace more than 1,650 distressed public housing units with more than 2,800 new mixed-income, mixed-use housing units as part of an overall effort to revitalize neighborhoods. For every $1 in Choice Neighborhoods funding they receive, the awardees and their partners will leverage an additional $9 in public and private funding for their project proposals.
""The Choice Neighborhoods Initiative is responsible for transforming what were once vacant lots, crumbling parks and storefronts and distressed housing into vibrant communities,"" said Castro. ""It has become one of our nation's most important tools in the fight to ensure that every family - no matter where they live - has the resources and strong foundation to succeed.""
HUD received 33 applications for the FY2014/15 Implementation Grants. The following awardees will receive a combined total of nearly $150 million in award from the competition funds:
Read summaries of the grants announced today.
In addition to today's grant announcement, Sacramento was previously designated a Promise Zone and was awarded a Choice Neighborhoods Planning Grant. Kansas City, Memphis and Atlanta received Choice Neighborhoods Planning Grants in FY2010.
Building on the successes of HUD's HOPE VI Program, Choice Neighborhoods links housing improvements with a wide variety of public services and neighborhood improvements to create neighborhoods of opportunity. With today's announcement, HUD has awarded more than $500 million in Choice Implementation Grants since 2011. Choice Neighborhoods is focused on three core goals:
• Housing: Replace distressed public and assisted housing with high-quality mixed-income housing that is well-managed and responsive to the needs of the surrounding neighborhood;
• People: Improve educational outcomes and intergenerational mobility for youth with services and supports delivered directly to youth and their families; and
• Neighborhood: Create the conditions necessary for public and private reinvestment in distressed neighborhoods to offer the kinds of amenities and assets, including safety, good schools, and commercial activity, that are important to families' choices about their community.
HUD's Choice Neighborhoods Initiative is one of the signature programs of the White House Neighborhood Revitalization Initiative (www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/oua/initiatives/neighborhood-revitalization), which supports innovative and inclusive strategies that bring public and private partners together to help break the cycle of intergenerational poverty. It encourages collaboration between HUD and the Departments of Education, Justice, Treasury and Health and Human Services to support local solutions for sustainable, mixed-income neighborhoods with the affordable housing, safe streets and good schools all families need."
09/29/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-120.cfm,"HUD Awards Bartlesville, Oklahoma $500,000 Main Street Grant","WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that the Bartlesville Redevelopment Trust Authority will receive a $500,000 grant to redevelop the former Washington County Memorial Hospital and build additional affordable housing units targeted to low-income residents. The grant is funded through HUD's HOPE VI MainStreet Program.
The Bartlesville Redevelopment Trust Authority and the Washington County Affordable Housing Coalition will use the funding to facilitate the redevelopment of the former Washington County Memorial Hospital. The grant will fund the development of six affordable housing units in the resulting Memorial Hospital Lofts. The hospital has fond memories for those who are Bartlesville natives, many of whom were born or had babies in the hospital. This grant will also help preserve this locally cherished property.
The former Memorial Hospital is a five-story, 52,000 square foot, historic building that opened in 1923. The hospital closed in 1992 and was deeded back to Washington County when a new hospital was built two miles east of its location.
""Linking affordable housing to healthcare is essential for families in smaller, older communities,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""Revitalizing the Washington County Hospital will not only create jobs, but give the residents access to doctors in their community. I'm proud that HUD can be a partner in rebuilding an area in need, while creating affordable housing and easier access to healthcare services.""
The Main Street program seeks to rejuvenate older, downtown business districts while retaining the area's traditional and historic character by providing grants to smaller communities for the development of affordable housing. Such communities must have an ongoing Main Street revitalization effort. Under Main Street, obsolete commercial offices or buildings can be reconfigured into rent producing affordable housing."

09/30/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-122.cfm,HUD Awards $2 Million to Reduce Health Hazards in Housing,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today awarded more than $2 million in research grants designed to protect children and other vulnerable groups from health hazards in their homes. This funding highlights the link between housing and health, and methods for reducing residential health hazards. HUD's grants are being awarded to two universities and a non-profit research institution studying new low-cost methods to control asthma triggers in the home, and to control tobacco smoke residue that has settled on home surfaces (referred to as third-hand smoke. Read below a complete project-by-project summary of the programs awarded grants today.
The following is a state-by-state breakdown of the funding announced today:
HUD's Healthy Homes Technical Studies (HHTS) Grant Program supports research on new approaches to improve the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of methods to evaluate and control of housing-related health and safety hazards. The program is particularly focused on the health of children and other vulnerable groups. The grants announced today as part of HUD's overall Healthy Homes Program supplement the $101 million in grants HUD awarded in August to protect thousands of children from lead and other home health hazards.
As HUD marks its 50th anniversary, HUD Secretary Julián Castro is focused on advancing policies that create opportunities for all Americans, including helping children and families secure quality housing and protecting them from home health and safety hazards.
""Finding new and improved ways to keep asthma and secondhand smoke under control so that children excel is vital to a family's well-being,"" said Secretary Castro. ""The research that will be conducted under these grants will show how low-cost methods can be used to make and keep their homes healthy.""
""Asthma and other respiratory diseases continue to afflict too many children and other vulnerable individuals,"" said Matthew Ammon, Director of HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes. ""These grants will support important research that will improve our ability to better manage these illneses through cost effective home interventions.
HUD's Healthy Homes Program promotes safe, decent, and sanitary housing as a means for preventing disease and injury. There is an emerging body of scientific evidence—to which these new grants will contribute—linking health outcomes such as asthma, lead poisoning, and unintentional injuries to substandard housing. Housing of all types and ages may contain hazards. Creating healthier housing promotes the health of people of all ages, but especially our most vulnerable, and thus has the potential to save billions annually in health care costs. Everyone needs a healthy home and some of the most serious health problems are linked to our homes. There are special reasons to focus on the home environment:
On average we spend about 70 percent of our time in our homes. Children's play and interactions can expose them to toxins such as insect residues and tobacco smoke that have settled on surfaces in the home. Millions of U.S. homes have existing hazards such as deteriorated lead-based paint, elevated radon levels, or pest infestation.

10/05/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-123.cfm,HUD Charges Pennsylvania Landlord with Discriminating Against Families with Children,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has charged a Pennsylvania landlord with housing discrimination for allegedly refusing to rent apartments to families with children. HUD's charge alleges that Michael DeRomo, who owns and manages rental properties and formerly owned a four-unit building in Coopersburg, posted an online classified ad for one of his Coopersburg units that discouraged families with children from applying. Specifically, the ad read: ""Not suitable for children due to the exterior landing and stairs."" Read HUD's charge.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to deny housing because a family has children under the age of 18 and to make statements that discriminate against families with children. Housing may exclude families with children only if it qualifies as housing for older persons under the Act. The Fair Housing Act permits the family—not the landlord—to decide what unit is appropriate or safe for them.
""Landlords and housing providers have an obligation to treat every applicant the same. This includes families with children,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Discriminatory ads are also against the law and HUD will continue to take appropriate action any time the Fair Housing Act is violated.""
HUD's charge stems from a complaint filed by the Fair Housing Council of Suburban Philadelphia, an organization in HUD's Fair Housing Initiatives Program, after testers with the organization contacted DeRomo to inquire about the advertised unit.
According the HUD's charge, a female tester posing as the mother of a four-year-old told DeRomo that she would be sharing the apartment with her daughter. After being told about the child, DeRomo allegedly told the tester that the ad stated ""no kids"" because the stairwell landing was not secure and he did not feel comfortable renting the unit to the family due to safety concerns for the child. Meanwhile, DeRomo gave a tester who said she had no children a tour of the unit and a rental application. DeRomo ultimately rented the unit to an applicant without children. DeRomo allegedly stated that he has not allowed any family to live in the two second-floor apartments of the Coopersburg building due to the landing and the stairs.
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages to the complainant for the harm caused it by the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose fines to vindicate the public interest. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages.
Persons who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY).

Specifically, HUD's charge alleges that Goodsell subjected the woman, who occupied the house with her two children and her boyfriend, to repeated inappropriate sexual comments and physical contact. Read HUD's charge.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful for a housing manager or owner to sexually harass a tenant. This includes conditioning housing on the tenant's acquiescence to sexual demands.
""No woman should have to endure unwanted sexual advances and degrading treatment in order to keep a roof over her head,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD is committed to protecting the housing rights of women and will continue to take action anytime those rights are violated.""
HUD's charge alleges that Goodsell, who had been hired to make repairs to the house and was managing it for its owner, allegedly made numerous sexually explicit statements to the woman, including requesting favors. Goodsell also allegedly made inappropriate physical contact with the woman and on at least one occasion used his key to enter the rental home while the woman was inside, without the woman's permission. The woman complained to the owner about Goodsell's behavior, sought a court order and filed a police report, but the harassment continued, ultimately forcing the woman to move out.
A United States Administrative Law Judge will hear the charges unless any party to the charges elects to have the case heard in federal district court.
Persons who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY).

10/07/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-125.cfm,HUD Charges Colorado Landlords with Discriminating Against Families,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced it is charging a group of Colorado landlords with housing discrimination for allegedly relegating families with children to apartments in the rear building of an apartment complex. HUD charged property owners Roger Loecher and Eileen Loecher, and on-site manager Miriam Yehudah, after fair housing testing discovered illegal ""steering"" was taking place based upon the tenant's family status. Read HUD's charge.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to deny or limit housing because a family has children under the age of 18 and to make statements that discriminate against families with children. Housing may exclude children only if it meets the Fair Housing Act's exemption for housing for older persons.
""Families with children have the right to the housing of their choice,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Discriminatory steering is against the law and the action we're taking reaffirms our commitment to protect the fair housing rights of families with children.""
The charge is the result of evidence from fair housing tests conducted by the nonprofit group Denver Metro Fair Housing Center. The 28-unit complex in Lakewood consists of two buildings - one in the front and one in the rear of the complex.
The charge alleges that the fair housing testing revealed an ongoing practice of illegally steering families with children to apartment units in the rear building of the complex, while renters without children were offered units in the front building. A tester from the nonprofit, who posed as a potential renter without children, was told about and shown an available unit in the front building, while a tester with children was only shown units in the back building. Yehuda also allegedly told testers without children that he tried to keep families with children in the back and adults without children in the front.
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages to the complainant for harm caused by discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose fines to vindicate the public interest. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages.

10/08/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-126.cfm,'Rebuild By Design' Named Most Groundbreaking Federal Competition,"WASHINGTON - In the nearly three years since Hurricane Sandy devastated coastal communities in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Rockefeller Foundation and a multi-discipline team of regional planning partners organized a nearly $1 billion competition to foster coordination and resilience at the local level and across the country. Today, the General Services Administration (GSA) awarded HUD's Rebuild by Design (www.rebuildbydesign.org/what-is-rebuild-by-design/) Competition the first-ever ""Most Groundbreaking Federal Challenge or Prize Competition.""
Rebuild by Design was selected by GSA to receive this award from a group of more than 100 nominations. The award marks the fifth anniversary of Challenge.gov, a GSA platform that hosts competitions for more than 75 federal agencies. The award recognizes some of the most innovative prize designs that have created groundbreaking solutions to significant, intractable problems.
""Rebuild by Design is a perfect example of proactive partnerships working to solve our great challenges"" said Denise Turner Roth, GSA Administrator. ""This is made possible through innovative prize competitions that unlock the talent and cooperation of Americans across the country. GSA is honored to manage the Challenge.gov platform and looks forward to continued partnership with federal agencies to solve the American people's most pressing challenges. I am pleased to recognize the Rebuild by Design competition, which generated groundbreaking solutions in standards for community engagement, collaboration with state and local government partners, and in-depth research.""
""This recognition is a powerful testament to what can happen when government is willing to consider new ideas to get the best possible outcomes,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""The realities of climate change demand new coordinated approaches to protecting coastal communities. Rebuild by Design is turning vulnerable communities into attractive, livable areas that can weather future storms.""
""When Superstorm Sandy struck the Tri-State area, Rockefeller stood at the ready to work with HUD and provide support to innovate how recovery dollars would be spent,"" said Dr. Judith Rodin, President of the Rockefeller Foundation. ""The GSA's recognition of Rebuild by Design's success underscores the importance of collaboration; the power created when philanthropies, government and business work together is unparalleled and has been shown to create innovative solutions to even the most daunting problems.""
Background
The Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force launched the Rebuild by Design competition in June 2013, a multi-stage planning and design competition to promote resilience in the Sandy-affected region. Working close with the Rockefeller Foundation and other philanthropic, academic and non-profit organizations, HUD conducted the competition and administered the competition in partnership with philanthropic, academic, and nonprofit organizations. The goal of the competition was to promote innovation by developing regionally-scalable but locally-contextual solutions that increase resilience in the region. The competition also represented a policy innovation by committing to set-aside HUD Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) funding specifically to incentivize the implementation of winning projects and proposals. Examples of design solutions were expected to range in scope and scale - from large-scale green infrastructure to small-scale residential resiliency retrofits.
In June 2014, HUD awarded $930 million to seven winning ideas. These designs are a blueprint for how coastal communities in the United States can maximize resilience as they rebuild and recover from major disasters. HUD chose the winners for their excellence in design and resilience and their engagement with local communities. These ideas will serve as a model for how States and local communities mitigate the effects of climate change and natural disasters in communities throughout the Sandy region, the United States, and the world. Read more about the winning designs.
The Rebuild by Design competition set new standards for robust community engagement, intense collaboration with state/local government partners, and in-depth research. The design teams toured 41 neighborhoods in the region during the research phase and worked closely with residents, community stakeholders and local governments in order to design implementable solutions for a more resilient region. Overall, the competition included the participation of 535 organizations, 64 community events, 141 neighborhoods and cities, and 181 government agencies.
The Competition is also an example of a unique public-private partnership. The Rockefeller Foundation was the leading funding partner for Rebuild by Design, supporting the analysis and design process. Other foundations/organizations such as New York University's Institute of Public Knowledge, the Regional Plan Association, the Municipal Arts Society of New York and the Van Alen Institute contributed expertise and resources to the competition as well.
Earlier this year, Rebuild by Design also earned the Walter Gellhorn Innovation Award from the Administrative Conference of the United States (ACUS) bestowed its Walter Gellhorn Innovation Award as a model practice that can be adopted government-wide."
10/14/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-127.cfm,Wisconsin Landlords Charged with Housing Discrimination After Claims They Allowed Daily Harassment of Tenants with Disabilities,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced today that it is charging the owner and managers of an apartment complex in Cross Plains, Wisconsin with violating the Fair Housing Act for failing to take action to stop several tenants from harassing a neighbor, who has cerebral palsy, and her daughter with Down's syndrome. Read HUD's charge.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful for a housing manager or owner to fail to fulfill a duty to correct and end the harassment of one tenant by another, when that harassment is based on race, color, religion, sex, familial status, national origin or, as was the case here, disability. The Fair Housing Act also makes it unlawful to interfere with any person's right to enjoy their home.
""A person's home should be where they feel the greatest level of comfort - not anguish and fear because of being subjected to humiliating and degrading comments,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Harassing a person because of their disability is not only disturbing, it is illegal.""
HUD charged Applewood of Cross Plains, LLC, William Ranguette and Candice Wood, collectively the owners and managers of Applewood Apartments, a 55-plus senior housing complex with 15 units in Cross Plains, Wisconsin, with the housing discrimination.
The case came to HUD's attention when the mother filed a complaint alleging that she and her daughter were being subjected to constant harassment by some of their neighbors at Applewood Apartments. Specifically, the mother alleged that several of her neighbors repeatedly followed her and her daughter making offensive comments to them. In one exchange, a neighbor allegedly told the woman and her daughter: ""You don't belong here...You belong in an institution."" In another encounter, a resident allegedly referred to the woman's daughter as ""mentally retarded"" telling her, ""You shouldn't be out of your apartment during the day.""
Local police warned the offending residents that citations might be forthcoming if more reports were made, but the harassment continued. The woman also reported the harassment to apartment managers but rather than addressing the behavior, one manager began pressuring the woman to move, stating that he did not believe the woman's daughter was capable of living independently and that the two of them were causing too much trouble.
The woman and her daughter moved out of their apartment after they were served notice that their lease would not be renewed.
A United States Administrative Law Judge will hear the charges unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court.
Persons who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY).

10/14/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-128.cfm,HUD Charges Minnesota Property Owners with Discriminating Against Resident with Disabilities,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is charging the owner and managers of Bramante's Apartments, a 120-unit complex in New Brighton, Minnesota, with violating the Fair Housing Act by refusing to allow a resident with disabilities to have a dedicated accessible parking spot. HUD's charge alleges that Terry Persaud, Mary Huebner and Persaud Bramante Apartments LLC denied the woman's request for a reasonable accommodation, which resulted in the woman falling several times because of the distance she had to walk to her unit. Read HUD's charge.
The Fair Housing Act requires housing providers to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices or services when such accommodations may be necessary to afford a person with a disability equal opportunity to use and enjoy his or her dwelling, including granting parking allowances for persons who require assistance.
""Housing providers need to understand that many people with mobility impairments rely on amenities, such as accessible parking spaces, to perform daily functions and that as providers they have an obligation to grant those accommodations,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""HUD remains committed to taking action when the housing rights of individuals with disabilities are violated.""
The case came to HUD's attention when the woman, who has an ambulatory disability and cannot walk more than 200 feet, filed a complaint alleging that the apartment owners refused to allow her to have a dedicated accessible parking space. The property owners did designate a general handicapped space that did meet her needs but because the landlord would not reserve it for her sole use, the spot was often occupied by other residents. After experiencing several falls because of having to walk significant distances to her unit, the woman moved out for fear of hurting herself further.
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages to the woman for the harm caused her by the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose fines to vindicate the public interest. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages.
In FY 2014, disability was the most common basis of complaints filed with HUD and its partner agencies, being cited as a basis for 4,606 complaints, or 54 percent of the overall total.
Persons who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY).

10/15/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-129.cfm,New York City Landlords Charged with Discriminating Against Resident with Disabilities,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it is charging the owners and landlords of a high-rise complex in New York City with violating the Fair Housing Act by refusing to allow a resident with disabilities to have an emotional support animal. HUD's charge alleges that Friedman Residence, LLC (formerly called the Aurora), Common Ground Management Corporation, and The Actors' Fund of America refused to accept that the resident required a dog to cope with the symptoms of his disability. Read HUD's charge.
The Fair Housing Act requires housing providers to make reasonable accommodations in policies or practices when a person with a disability requires such accommodations, including granting waivers to ""no-pet"" policies for persons who require assistance or support animals. Additionally, the law makes it unlawful to make housing unavailable to any person because of a disability.
""It's not a landlord's role to determine what a resident with disabilities needs in order to perform life's daily functions,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""Landlords have an obligation to grant reasonable accommodations when they are needed and HUD will continue to work to ensure that they meet that obligation.""
The case came to HUD's attention after the resident, who has a psychiatric disability, filed a complaint with HUD alleging that his right to have an emotional support animal was denied. The man lives in a two-bedroom apartment at The Dorothy Ross Friedman Residence, a 30-story supportive housing residence for senior citizens, working professionals and persons living with HIV/AIDS that is sponsored by the Actors' Fund, a New York nonprofit for performing arts and entertainment professionals.
When the tenant moved into Friedman Residence in 2004 he did not have a support animal. However, in 2010 the resident began being treated by a licensed clinical psychologist and a year later bought a small dog. After recognizing an improvement in the man's condition, his doctor recommended that he register the animal as an official emotional support animal.
In February 2013, the landlords initiated eviction procedures against the man due to the presence of the dog. The man subsequently provided the property management director with documents from his doctor and the National Service Animal Registry showing that the dog was an emotional support animal, but instead of accepting the documentation, the landlords sent the man a final ""Notice of Termination,"" stating that he had not sufficiently demonstrated his need for the animal. Legal proceedings between the resident and the landlords in New York County Civil Court were stayed while this charge was investigated.
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages to the man for the harm caused him by the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose fines to vindicate the public interest. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages.

Working with his team, he also oversaw the provision of subsidized housing to more than 180,000 low-income households in Alaska, Idaho, Oregon and Washington state.
""It has been a privilege and an honor to serve with some of the most passionate, committed public servants I've ever met,"" said Block. ""I'll always look upon this opportunity to serve as Regional Administrator with fondness and it will serve as a lasting source of inspiration for me. Now, because of a health concern, it's time for me to pull back a little on the reins. I'm fortunate in that I get to return to my roots, ending homelessness, while still working with a HUD team that I care dearly about.""
In his new role as an Advisor on homelessness, Block will assist HUD's national efforts to end homelessness, continuing and expanding on his work in the field to end chronic and veteran homelessness.
Block began his tenure at HUD on November 18, 2013, succeeding Mary McBride who now serves as HUD's Assistant Deputy Secretary for Field Policy and Management.
""Few individuals are as accomplished or as service-oriented as Bill Block,"" said McBride. ""His departure as an RA will be deeply felt within the agency. Bill has worked tirelessly with regional stakeholders to end homelessness, expand affordable housing resources and preserve public housing throughout Region 10. We're pleased that Bill accepted our offer to stay on as an advisor on homelessness to add bench strength and an additional focus on one of the Department's premier issues.""
Prior to coming to HUD, Mr. Block led a private law practice focused on complex real estate transactions on behalf of both private and public entities in the state of Washington. He also served as the Director of the Committee to End Homelessness, coordinating the efforts of some 70 local government, non-profit and for-profit entities, faith-based communities, philanthropies and formerly homeless people in implementing the County's 10 Year Plan to End Homelessness in Seattle/King County.
Block also served as Chair of the Seattle Housing Authority Board of Commissioners, President of AIDS Housing of Washington (now Building Changes), Chair of the Seattle Center Advisory Commission, Chair of the Low Income Housing Levy Oversight Committee and board member of the Downtown Emergency Service Center and the Workforce Development Council of Seattle/King County.
Deputy Regional Administrator Donna Batch will serve as acting Regional Administrator once Block transitions to his new position."

New Residential Construction data for October 2015 will be released on Wednesday, November 18, 2015, at 8:30 A.M. EDT.
EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take two months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, 4 months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2%) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90-percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised about three percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found on our web site listed above.
* 90% confidence interval includes zero. The Census Bureau does not have sufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero.

10/20/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-132.cfm,HUD Marks a Major Shared Services Milestone with Financial Services Migration,"WASHINGTON - Today, October 20, 2015, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announces another major milestone in transitioning HUD's financial management and procurement operations to the U.S. Department of Treasury's Administrative Resource Center (ARC). This milestone marks the shift of financial and procurement management functions from HUD to ARC. Although significant work remains, HUD is the first cabinet-level agency to move core financial systems to a Federal Shared Service Provider.
In 2010, HUD reviewed its aging financial systems, and decided to transition from costly legacy systems that did not provide the necessary scale and breadth required to meet today's financial management needs.
""In an environment of increasingly restrained resources, HUD realized it needed to move away from inefficient systems that carry a risk of failure and need time-consuming maintenance,"" said Nani Coloretti, HUD Deputy Secretary. ""Transitioning to a shared service was the most efficient path forward. By partnering with ARC (Treasury), we gain valuable efficiencies and are adopting certain standards that will allow the Department to engage in better analytical and risk-based management.""
""Treasury commends HUD's leadership in partnering with the ARC for its core accounting and financial services,"" said David Lebryk, Fiscal Assistant Secretary, U.S. Department of the Treasury. ""Our collaboration with HUD is a significant milestone in achieving greater accuracy, timeliness, and transparency in federal financial management. We also believe that this groundbreaking joint effort will serve as an important learning tool for greater delivery of shared services across government in general.""
""This transition will enable HUD to focus its 7,500+ workforce on serving the nation's housing and community development needs by reducing employee's administrative burden,"" said Joe Hungate, Acting Chief Financial Officer, HUD. ""Furthermore, it will provide the framework for HUD to comply with federal financial management regulations.""
This collaborative relationship between HUD and Treasury is the result of the Federal IT Shared Services Strategy (https://cio.gov/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2013/04/CIOC-Federal-Shared-Services-Implementation-Guide.pdf). In May 2012, the Office of Management & Budget (OMB) announced the strategy to agencies for identifying and operating shared services for commodity, support, and mission IT functions. That strategy recommended a phased approach for implementing shared services, (e.g., ""crawl-walk-run"") beginning with intra-agency commodity IT, to allow agencies to gain proficiency, then evolving to support and mission IT areas.
""The New Core project is one of the most significant accomplishments for HUD, ARC, and the Administration,"" said Rafael Diaz, Chief Information Officer, New Core Executive Sponsor, and HUD. ""This project demonstrates the possibilities and successes when agencies collaborate to achieve a higher goal. It has been exciting to work with these talented teams, and I look forward to building upon these early accomplishments. New Core has opened the door for further IT innovation and business rationalization at HUD.""
The transformative project has made significant progress to date. In October 2014, HUD began its phased implementation, migrating travel functions, and in February 2015, its time and attendance functions. Together with the most recent payment processing milestones, HUD's New Core project continues to enhance financial transparency and analytical capabilities, increase regulatory compliance, and improve efficiency through the transition of HUD's core financials and key administrative systems and services."
10/20/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-133.cfm,HUD Announces Clinton Global Initiative Commitment to Action Promoting Science Oriented Jobs and Economic Development,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announces a Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) Commitment to Action for the STEM, Energy, and Economic Development Initiative (SEED): Coalitions for Community Growth. SEED focuses on increasing Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) education, job skill development, and energy literacy for residents of public housing. In partnership with local public housing authorities (PHAs), SEED will create local coalitions of public-private partners to create or expand programs in these areas. The initiative is being piloted in five communities: Cleveland, Denver, San Antonio, Tampa and Washington DC, with the goal to expand to 20 cities by 2018. The CGI Commitment to Action can be viewed here (https://www.clintonfoundation.org/clinton-global-initiative/commitments/seed-coalitions-community-growth#sthash.6PL2Ju3o.dpuf).
""Every child deserves a fair shot at achieving their dreams, and through SEED we are investing in the next generation of American workers and businesses so they may compete in the 21st century global economy,"" said Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for the Office of Public and Indian Housing, Lourdes Castro-Ramirez. ""By equipping our children with the technology skills they need, we're preparing them to thrive in today's job market and become tomorrow's leaders in cutting-edge industries.""
Earlier this year at the CGI America meeting in Denver CO, HUD announced the launch of SEED, which is a unique collaboration between HUD, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), and the U.S. Department of Education (ED) that will help address the shortfall of STEM graduates as noted in President Obama's National Science and Technology Council's five-year strategic plan (https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/stem_stratplan_2013.pdf).
HUD and DOE have made significant investments in infrastructure upgrades and residential energy retrofits to conserve resources on a national scale. Through SEED, HUD is building on these investments by working with its local housing authorities and other partners to create educational and employment opportunities for public housing residents. The goal is to provide training that will lead to career-oriented employment opportunities in STEM fields and other areas of future economic growth.
This approach will also leverage HUD's Section 3 program which requires PHAs that receive federal funds for capital improvements to train and hire public housing and low income residents. Using Section 3, HUD will encourage SEED PHAs to use their energy retrofit projects or other capital improvement projects to train and employ residents in STEM/energy-related employment generated by these investments.
Other federal programs that will be leveraged include: DOE's Better Buildings Challenge, Energy Saver and Energy Literacy programs to provide technical assistance and energy education resources. ED will leverage its investments in adult and technical education programs to benefit SEED communities.
In addition to the resources provided by the three federal agencies, to date five national partners are supporting SEED: Boys & Girls Club of America (BGCA), the National Center for Women & Information Technology (NCWIT), The Corps Network, the Carnegie Science Center, and US2020.

10/21/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-135.cfm,HUD and VA Launch New Demonstration to Provide Permanent Homes for Native American Veterans Experiencing Homelessness,"WASHINGTON - For the first time ever, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) are launching a demonstration program to offer a permanent home and supportive services to Native American Veterans who are experiencing or at risk of experiencing homelessness. The Tribal HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (Tribal HUD-VASH) Program will combine $4 million in rental assistance from HUD with case management and clinical services provided by VA to serve approximately 600 Native American Veterans.
HUD Secretary Julián Castro announced this new demonstration program during a speech to the 72ndAnnual Convention of the National Congress of American Indians in San Diego.
""Today, we open a new door of opportunity for our Native American Veterans who have worn our nation's uniform but who need our help,"" said Castro. ""The evidence is clear that by offering permanent housing solutions, combined with needed services and case management, we can end homelessness.""
HUD is inviting 30 eligible tribes to seek Tribal HUD-VASH vouchers to help house and serve an estimated 600 Native American Veterans who are currently experiencing homelessness or at extreme risk of becoming homeless. Read HUD's notice published today (https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2015/10/21/2015-26748/implementation-of-the-tribal-hud-va-supportive-housing-program).
Since 2008, more than 79,000 vouchers have been awarded and approximately 90,000 homeless Veterans have been served through the broader HUD-VASH program. Rental assistance and supportive services provided through HUD-VASH are a critical resource for local communities in ending homelessness among our nation's Veterans. This year, Congress authorized funding for a demonstration program in order to expand the HUD-VASH program into Indian Country and directed HUD to coordinate with Indian tribes, tribally designated housing entities (TDHEs), and other appropriate tribal organizations on the design of this program, and to ensure the effective delivery of housing assistance and supportive services to eligible Native American Veterans.
The Tribal HUD-VASH Program will provide rental assistance and supportive services to Native American Veterans that are Homeless or at risk of Homelessness living on or near a reservation or other Indian areas. HUD is making available $4 million in grant funding to Indian tribes and TDHEs to fund this rental assistance and associated administrative fees. Indian tribes and TDHEs participating in this program must partner with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to provide healthcare assistance to eligible Native American Veterans."
10/21/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-136.cfm,HUD Proposes Rule to Clarify Protections for Victims of Harassment in Housing,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced today that it is issuing a proposed rule that would formalize standards for victims of harassment in housing to bring claims under the Fair Housing Act. The proposed rule, ""Quid Pro Quo and Hostile Environment Harassment and Liability for Discriminatory Housing Practices under the Fair Housing Act"" (https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2015/10/21/2015-26587/quid-pro-quo-and-hostile-environment-harassment-and-liability-for-discriminatory-housing-practices), was published in the Federal Register today for public comment.
While no formal regulation has been in place, HUD and courts have long held that harassment in housing or housing-related transactions on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, disability, and familial status is prohibited under the Fair Housing Act. The proposed rule specifies how claims of ""hostile environment"" and ""quid pro quo"" harassment would be evaluated in both private and publicly assisted housing.
""A home should be a refuge where every woman and man deserves to live without the threat of violence or harassment. The rule HUD is proposing is designed to better protect victims of harassment by offering greater clarity for how to handle a claim against an abuser,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro.
Sexual harassment is the most common form of harassment complaint received by HUD. Harassment in housing threatens a resident's sense of safety and privacy in their own home, and there can be little opportunity to escape such harassment unless the individual or family moves. In HUD's experience enforcing the Fair Housing Act, low-income women, often racial and ethnic minorities and persons with disabilities, may be particularly vulnerable to sexual harassment in housing.
The Department continues to aggressively pursue claims of harassment in housing. For example, HUD recently filed a charge of discrimination against a Wisconsin landlord who failed to take action to stop tenants from harassing other tenants, a mother and daughter with disabilities. HUD also charged a South Dakota property manager with sexually harassing a female tenant with two children. In addition, the Department of Justice recently agreed on a consent decree resolving a case investigated and charged by HUD (http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/kanawha-county-west-virginia-property-manager-and-owner-pay-120000-settle-sexual-harassment) involving sexual harassment by employees of a West Virginia property management firm.
HUD's proposed rule will:
Formalize uniform standards for evaluating claims of hostile environment and quid pro quo harassment in the housing context: Hostile Environment Harassment involves subjecting a person to unwelcome conduct that is sufficiently severe or pervasive such that it interferes with or deprives the person the right to use and enjoy the housing. Quid Pro Quo Harassment involves subjecting a person to an unwelcome request or demand and making submission to the request or demand a condition related to the person's housing. Clarify when housing providers and other covered entities or individuals may be held directly or vicariously liable under the Fair Housing Act for illegal harassment or other discriminatory housing practices.
• Formalize uniform standards for evaluating claims of hostile environment and quid pro quo harassment in the housing context:
• Hostile Environment Harassment involves subjecting a person to unwelcome conduct that is sufficiently severe or pervasive such that it interferes with or deprives the person the right to use and enjoy the housing.
• Quid Pro Quo Harassment involves subjecting a person to an unwelcome request or demand and making submission to the request or demand a condition related to the person's housing.
• Clarify when housing providers and other covered entities or individuals may be held directly or vicariously liable under the Fair Housing Act for illegal harassment or other discriminatory housing practices.
HUD has submitted its proposed rule for publication in the Federal Register. The general public will have sixty (60) days from the date of publication to submit comments on the proposed rule. HUD encourages interested persons to submit comments electronically through the Federal eRulemaking Portal at www.regulations.gov during the public comment period. The complete proposed rule can be viewed here (https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2015/10/21/2015-26587/quid-pro-quo-and-hostile-environment-harassment-and-liability-for-discriminatory-housing-practices).

10/23/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-137.cfm,HUD Charges Texas Landlords with Discrimination for Imposing Overly Restrictive Rules on Families with Children,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has charged Blackacre, L.L.C. and Alishia Ritchkey, the former owner and manager of Pebble Beach Apartments, a 61-unit complex in Universal City, Texas, with violating the Fair Housing Act by imposing overly restrictive rules on children under 16 who lived there. HUD also charged Implicity Management Company, the current management company, and Pebble Beach Apartments L.L.C, the current owner of the complex, with discriminating based on familial status. Read HUD's charge.
The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in the sale, rental, and financing of dwellings, based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, and disability. This includes setting rules that discriminate against families with children.
""Instituting rules that limit the activities of daily life for families with children violates the Fair Housing Act,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""The Fair Housing Act protects the rights of families to enjoy their homes free from unreasonable restrictions on their children.""
Specifically, HUD's charge alleges that Pebble Beach's rules discriminated against families by prohibiting children under the age of 16 from being in their home without an adult, using the laundry facilities without an adult present, using the pool without an adult present, or using their scooters or bikes on the street and parking lots without an adult. HUD's charge further alleges that residents were told that parking lots were not to be used as playgrounds and that if children were left playing ""in the street"" with bikes, scooters, etc. they would be given a 24-hour notice to vacate.
The case came to HUD's attention after the Fair Housing Council of Greater San Antonio, a HUD Fair Housing Initiatives Program agency, filed a complaint based on tests that showed that policies put into place by the current and former owners of the complex were overly restrictive to families with children.
HUD's charge will be heard by a United States Administrative Law Judge unless any party to the charge elects to have the case heard in federal district court. If an administrative law judge finds after a hearing that discrimination has occurred, he may award damages to the complainant for the harm caused by the discrimination. The judge may also order injunctive relief and other equitable relief, as well as payment of attorney fees. In addition, the judge may impose fines to vindicate the public interest. If the matter is decided in federal court, the judge may also award punitive damages.
Anyone who believes he or she has experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to www.hud.gov/fairhousing, or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, which can be accessed through Apple or Android devices."
10/26/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-138.cfm,HUD and Census Bureau Report New Residential Sales in September,"WASHINGTON - Sales of new single-family houses in September 2015 were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 468,000, according to estimates released jointly today by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Census Bureau. This is 11.5 percent (±11.3%)* below the revised August rate of 529,000 and is 2.0 percent (±17.9%) above the September 2014 estimate of 459,000.
The median sales price of new houses sold in September 2015 was $296,900; the average sales price was $364,100. The seasonally adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of September was 225,000. This represents a supply of 5.8 months at the current sales rate.
Estimates of houses sold and for sale by stage of construction are now available on a seasonally adjusted basis as well as not seasonally adjusted basis. Historic seasonally adjusted data will be available back to January 1999 at http://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/historical_data/.
New Residential Sales data for October 2015 will be released on Wednesday, November 25, 2015, at 10:00 A.M. EST. Read more about today's release of new home sales (www.census.gov/newhomesales).
EXPLANATORY NOTES
These statistics are estimated from sample surveys. They are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated average relative standard errors of the preliminary data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2%) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90-percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. Changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show irregular movement. It takes 3 months to establish a trend for new houses sold. Preliminary new home sales figures are subject to revision due to the survey methodology and definitions used. The survey is primarily based on a sample of houses selected from building permits. Since a ""sale"" is defined as a deposit taken or sales agreement signed, this can occur prior to a permit being issued. An estimate of these prior sales is included in the sales figure. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimate of total sales is revised about 4 percent. Changes in sales price data reflect changes in the distribution of houses by region, size, etc., as well as changes in the prices of houses with identical characteristics. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found on our web site listed above.
* 90% confidence interval includes zero. The Census Bureau does not have sufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero."
11/02/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-139.cfm,HUD Offers $8.7 Million to Prevent and End Homelessness,"WASHINGTON - Each year, men and women exiting the prison system face a multitude of challenges including finding employment and a home to call their own. As a result, many are at extreme risk of falling into homelessness. Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced an $8.7 million demonstration to address homelessness and reduce recidivism among the justice-involved population. Read the funding notice published today (www.grants.gov/view-opportunity.html?dpp=1&oppPkgId=219161&fromEmail=true).
HUD's Pay for Success Permanent Supportive Housing Demonstration (https://www.cfda.gov/?s=program&mode=form&tab=step1&id=423da6449df694848220c74ef341429b), funded by DOJ and implemented through a HUD/DOJ partnership, will test cost-effective ways to help persons cycling between the criminal justice and homeless service systems. In addition, this demonstration will offer a new source of financing to support Permanent Supportive Housing for the reentry population.
As HUD celebrates its 50th anniversary, HUD Secretary Julián Castro is focused on advancing policies that create opportunities for all Americans, including preventing and ending homelessness for all populations.
""Having the opportunity to find a job and a place to call home is a core value in our society,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""Unfortunately, too often individuals that committed minor crimes are falling into homelessness because they don't have the opportunity for a second chance. These grants will allow us to develop model of success that can help us stop the cycle of dependency and reduce the costs associated with recidivism and homelessness.""
""The Department of Justice is committed to giving formerly-incarcerated individuals the tools they need to become productive members of society,"" said Attorney General Loretta Lynch. ""Providing meaningful support through housing opportunities, prevention programs and other critical services is vital to our ongoing efforts to reduce recidivism, promote public safety, and foster positive results in communities across the country.""
Pay for Success (PFS) strategies are public-private arrangements that help government test or expand innovative programs while paying only for those activities that achieve agreed-upon target outcomes. In addition, PFS grants will implement a Housing First model for the reentry population who experience homelessness and are frequent users of homelessness, health care and other crisis services.
In 2010, President Obama and 19 federal agencies and offices that form the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH) launched the nation's first comprehensive strategy to prevent and end homelessness. Opening Doors: Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness (www.usich.gov/opening_doors/) serves as a roadmap for how the federal government will work with state and local communities to confront the root causes of homelessness, including individuals who are in and out of a variety of crisis services such as jails and prisons. Permanent Supportive Housing lowers public costs by stopping the revolving door between crisis services like those provided in prisons, jails, emergency rooms, and homeless assistance programs.
Established in 2011, the Federal Interagency Reentry Council represents 20 federal agencies, working to:
Make communities safer by reducing recidivism and victimization; Assist those who return from prison and jail in becoming productive citizens; and Save taxpayer dollars by lowering the direct and collateral costs of incarceration.
• Make communities safer by reducing recidivism and victimization;
• Assist those who return from prison and jail in becoming productive citizens; and
• Save taxpayer dollars by lowering the direct and collateral costs of incarceration.
The Reentry Council is based on the recognition that many federal agencies and local communities have a major stake in prisoner reentry. A chief focus of the Reentry Council is to remove federal barriers to successful reentry, so that motivated individuals - who have served their time and paid their debts - are able to compete for a job, attain stable housing, support their children and their families, and contribute to their communities. Reentry Council agencies are taking concrete steps to reduce recidivism and high correctional costs while improving public health, child welfare, employment, education, housing and other key reintegration outcomes."
11/02/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-140.cfm,HUD and Justice Department Announce New Efforts to Ease Transition from Prison and Expand Opportunities for Jobs and Housing,"CHICAGO - As part of President Obama's efforts to promote rehabilitation and reintegration for the formerly incarcerated, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) today announced $1.7 million for Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) to aid eligible public housing residents who are under the age of 24 to expunge or seal their records in accordance with their applicable state laws.
Through the Juvenile Re-entry Assistance Program (JRAP), HUD and DOJ are teaming up to help Americans who've paid their debt to society rehabilitate and reintegrate back into their communities.
This program specifically excludes makers of meth on public housing property, sex offenders or those convicted of domestic violence.
Additionally, HUD announced updated public housing arrests guidance to PHAs regarding the use of arrests in determining who can live in HUD-assisted properties. The Guidance outlines that arrest records may not be the basis for denying admission, terminating assistance or evicting tenants; and reiterates that HUD does not require PHAs and owners to adopt ""One Strike"" policies and includes best practices and models of success from PHAs across the nation.
""Young people who have been held accountable for nonviolent offenses and paid their debt to society deserve the opportunity to become active and productive members of their communities,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""These grants and guidance will allow Public Housing Authorities and their partners to help these young people reach their full potential.""
""The Department of Justice is committed to giving formerly-incarcerated individuals the tools they need to become productive members of society,"" said Attorney General Loretta Lynch. ""Providing meaningful support through housing opportunities, prevention programs and other critical services is vital to our ongoing efforts to reduce recidivism, promote public safety, and foster positive results in communities across the country.""
Dick Durbin, U.S. Senator, Illinois added: ""Ex-offenders, particularly young people, who have paid the price for making a mistake, should be given a second chance. Yet, those with a criminal record are routinely denied access to affordable housing, hindering their efforts to reintegrate and become productive members of their families and our communities. Wiping the slate clean for young ex-offenders will open new doors and increase public safety by reducing recidivism. They'll have opportunities to seek affordable housing, decent employment and a higher education -- the resources needed to successfully re-enter society, and rebuild lives"" Durbin said. ""I applaud Secretary Castro, Attorney General Lynch, and President Obama for their commitment to helping young offenders begin again with the tools to succeed.""
Danny K. Davis, U.S.Senator, Illinois added: ""I would like to commend President Obama, HUD and the Justice Department for expanding opportunities for returning citizens. As we continue to focus on the needs for returning citizens in the role of expungement, housing and training and job placement; I trust these initiatives will assist in a beneficial transition for individuals that have completed their sentences and are eager to be productive citizens.""
Having a criminal record severely limits a person's ability to seek higher education, find good employment, qualify for credit and secure affordable housing. Today, an estimated 60,000 youths under the age of 24 are confined in juvenile detention and correctional facilities, with hundreds of thousands more on probation. These consequences create unnecessary barriers to economic opportunity and productivity, and President Obama and members of his Cabinet continue to take impactful steps to ensure those returning from prison become productive, law-abiding citizens."
11/03/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-141.cfm,Former News Boys' Home in St. Louis Receives National Trust/HUD Secretary's Award for Excellence in Historic Preservation,"WASHINGTON – When Father Dunne's News Boys' Home and Protectorate was founded in 1906, it served as a refuge for orphaned or abandoned boys, many whom worked selling newspapers on the streets of St. Louis. For more than a century, the three-story building at 2010 Washington Avenue provided a home for those experiencing homelessness and after renovation in 1970, it became the Harbor Light Center serving persons struggling with chronic substance abuse and various disabilities.

This award recognizes efforts that advance the Nation's historic preservation goals while providing affordable housing and economic development opportunities for low- and moderate-income residents.
""This historically sensitive redevelopment represents a perfect marriage of missions – providing a stable home for our most vulnerable neighbors while preserving an important place in St. Louis' history,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""I'm proud to stand with the National Trust to recognize the hard work of those who understand that people and places define who we are.""
""The 3010 Apartments project exemplifies how historic preservation can uplift deteriorating, underutilized buildings and revitalize communities,"" said Stephanie Meeks, president of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. ""Spurred by historic tax credits, the Midtown Project will bring new housing, retail, restaurants and office space for creative businesses without sacrificing the neighborhood's historic character.""
The former boys' home underwent multiple renovations over the decades. Led by the Salvation Army, the 3010 Apartments Limited Partnership converted the existing barracks-like institutional housing into 58 one-bedroom, private residential apartments for low- to very low-income adult residents, giving preference to Veterans and those experiencing long-term or chronic homelessness.
Rehabilitation was accomplished without drastically altering the interiors and included the retention of historic elements. The main entry and its broad staircase were restored. The many stained glass windows were repaired and retained even where they occurred in private apartments. The original hallways were retained along with the rhythm of historic millwork: chair rails and slightly recessed, transomed wood paneled doors that now serve as entrances to many of the apartments. The former chapel now serves as a meeting space and the reception room with its columns, and elaborate plaster moldings was reopened and restored to its original appearance and is now used as a communal lounge for residents.
The 3010 Apartments is adjacent to a vacant city block that the Salvation Army is transforming as their Midtown Project in the heart of the historic but underutilized and deteriorating commercial area. The Midtown Project will include an estimated $48 million in new construction. The major historic rehabilitation of the 3010 Apartments resulted in an estimated 100 full-time jobs to Missourians for the last 2 years of the renovation and an estimated $350,000 in sales tax revenue on the construction materials.
The total cost of the project was $12,299,125. The City of St. Louis approved a10-year full property tax abatement and an additional five-year partial abatement so the ownership will have time to recover from the costs of the rehab before beginning to pay the increased property taxes."
11/10/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-142.cfm,HUD and VA Team Up to Help Homeless Veterans Find Permanent Homes,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) today announced a nearly $12 million to 79 local public housing agencies across the country to provide a permanent home to veterans experiencing homelessness. The supportive housing assistance announced today is provided through the HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) program which combines rental assistance from HUD with case management and clinical services provided by VA.
HUD is providing $6.4 million to 27 local Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) to provide permanent supportive housing to an estimated 821 Veterans. These vouchers are being awarded through the HUD-VASH Project-based Voucher Set-Aside competition, announced in June 2015. These PBVS will enable homeless veterans and their families to access affordable housing with an array of supportive services.
HUD is also providing 52 PHAs with a total of $5.4 million Extraordinary Administrative Fees (EAF) to support their HUD-VASH programs and reduce the amount of time that it takes for a Veteran to locate and move into permanent housing (See local funding charts below).
""It's unacceptable that anyone who wore our nation's uniform falls into homelessness and even calls the streets their home,"" said Secretary Julián Castro. ""Although we've made tremendous progress in preventing and reducing Veteran homelessness, these vouchers continue to build upon our shared mission to end veteran homelessness once and for all.""
""The Department of Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development and our federal and local partners should be proud of the gains made reducing veteran homelessness,"" said Secretary of Veterans Affairs Robert McDonald, ""but so long as there remains a veteran living on our streets, we have more work to do. The vouchers made available today are a vital tool in our joint effort and when combined with the wrap-around health care and education and training services VA can provide, we can make sure veterans across the country have a home.""
Last month, HUD and the VA announced a demonstration to offer a permanent home and supportive services to Native American Veterans who are experiencing or at risk of experiencing homelessness. Through this demonstration, HUD is making available $4 million in grant funding to Indian tribes and Tribally Designated Entities (TDHEs) to fund this rental assistance and associated administrative fees. HUD and VA anticipate awarding approximately 600 vouchers to Indian Tribes and TDHEs to help house and serve an estimated 600 Native American veterans who are experiencing homelessness or at the extreme risk of becoming homeless. Read HUD's Notice on the Implementation of the Tribal HUD-VA Supportive Housing Program (https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2015/10/21/2015-26748/implementation-of-the-tribal-hud-va-supportive-housing-program)."
11/10/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-143.cfm,"National Plan to Prevent 3,200 Lung Cancer Deaths Announced","WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development joined three federal departments and eight national organizations to announce a strategy to prevent 3,200 lung cancer deaths by driving change to reduce radon in 5 million high-radon homes, apartments, schools and childcare centers.
The National Radon Action Plan: A Strategy for Saving Lives sets out strategies to drive the changes needed to reduce exposure to radon, a naturally occurring, invisible and odorless gas. Radon is the second-leading cause of lung cancer, and causes an estimated 21,000 lung cancer deaths annually.
""Promoting radon testing and mitigation is an important part of HUD's Healthy Homes Program. High radon levels can be found in any home, and an inexpensive radon test is a simple action that we can all take to protect the health of our families,"" said Matthew Ammon, Director of HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes.
Four key approaches to reduce radon exposure are the focus of the National Radon Action Plan, including 14 specific strategies to achieve them. Strategies target specific approaches to reduce the growing problem of radon exposure. Because it is invisible and odorless, dangerous levels of radon often exist indoors without occupants' knowledge.
Radon is a radioactive gas that comes from natural processes in the ground. Nearly all soils contain uranium, which naturally decays over time to produce radon gas. Radon seeps up from the soil into the air, concentrating in buildings. While radon gas is the second-leading cause of lung cancer, effective measures do exist to reduce radon indoors, which can prevent radon-caused lung cancer and save lives.
Strategies include building in radon testing and systems to reduce radon as standard practice in housing finance and insurance programs, and embedding radon risk reduction requirements in building codes. The partners are meeting with groups, including housing finance and building code developers, to put the initial steps in place.
Ammon noted: ""My office will continue to look for opportunities to achieve more radon testing and mitigation in the U.S. housing stock.""
Joining HUD in committing to put these changes in place are the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and eight other organizations: the American Lung Association, American Association of Radon Scientists and Technologists, the American Society of Home Inspectors, Cancer Survivors Against Radon, the Children's Environmental Health Network, Citizens for Radioactive Radon Reduction the Conference of Radiation Control Program Directors, the Environmental Law Institute and the National Center for Healthy Housing. The partners welcome others who support these actions to join in the effort and endorse the plan.
In 2011, the Federal Radon Action Plan (http://www2.epa.gov/radon/federal-radon-action-plan) was released and has led to the protection from radon in more than 105,000 multi-family homes that have financing from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, among other measures. However, that 2011 plan focused solely on actions that federal agencies could take, while the new plan broadens the tools to include actions that the private sector and the non-governmental organizations can put in place.
The new National Plan can be found on HUD's website."
11/12/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-144.cfm,HUD Secretary Castro Announces new Rule Making Public Housing Smoke-Free,"WASHINGTON - Today, U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Julián Castro joined Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy in Alexandria, VA to announce a proposed rule to make the nation's public housing properties entirely smoke-free. HUD's proposed rule would require more than 3,100 public housing agencies (PHAs) across the country to implement smoke-free policies in their developments within 18 months of the final rule. Read HUD's proposed rule.
Under HUD's proposed rule, PHAs must implement a policy prohibiting lit tobacco products (cigarettes, cigars or pipes) in all living units, indoor common areas, administrative offices and all outdoor areas within 25 feet of housing and administrative office buildings. HUD is seeking public comment on this proposedrule for the next 60 days.
""We have a responsibility to protect public housing residents from the harmful effects of secondhand smoke, especially the elderly and children who suffer from asthma and other respiratory diseases,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""This proposed rule will help improve the health of more than 760,000 children and help public housing agencies save $153 million every year in healthcare, repairs and preventable fires.""
According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), cigarette smoking kills 480,000 Americans each year, making it the leading preventable cause of death in the United States. By reducing the public health risks associated with tobacco use and exposure to secondhand smoke, the proposed smoke-free rule will enhance the effectiveness of HUD's efforts to provide increased public health protection for residents of public housing. The rule will impact the more than 940,000 units that are currently not smoke-free, including more than 500,000 units inhabited by elderly households.
""Everyone - no matter where they live - deserves a chance to grow up in a healthy, smoke-free home,"" said U.S. Surgeon General Vivek H. Murthy. ""There is no safe level of secondhand smoke. So, when 58 million Americans - including 15 million children - are exposed to secondhand smoke, we have an obligation to act. That is what Secretary Castro is doing with this proposal.""
Since 2009, HUD strongly encouraged Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) to adopt smoke-free policies in their buildings and common areas. During this time, more than 600 PHAs and tribally designated housing entities adopted smoke-free policies.Currently, there are nearly 1.2 million public housing units across the country. Through HUD's voluntary policy and local initiatives, more than 228,000 public housing units are already smoke-free. If finalized, the proposed smoke-free rule announced today would expand the impact to more 940,000 public housing units.
HUD's proposed smoke-free rule will also help reduce damage and maintenance costs associated with smoking. It is estimated that smoking causes over 100,000 fires each year, resulting in more than 500 death and close to half a billion dollars in direct property damage; additionally, smoking is the lead cause of fire related deaths in multifamily buildings.

11/13/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-145.cfm,FHA Eases Condominium Project Approval Requirements,"WASHINGTON - The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) today published new guidelines under its condominium approval process intended to increase affordable housing options for first-time and low- to moderate-income homebuyers. Effective immediately, FHA's temporary guidance will streamline the agency's condominium recertification process and expand the eligibility of acceptable 'owner-occupied' units to include second homes that are not investor-owned. Read FHA's mortgagee letter.
These provisions will expire in one year and serve to revise FHA's condominium approval process until the agency can implement a more comprehensive condominium rule change. Today's guidance:
• Modifies the requirements for condominium project recertification;
• Revises the calculation of FHA's required owner-occupancy percentage; and
• Expands eligible condominium project insurance coverages.
Streamline Condominium Recertification
FHA-approved condominium projects require recertification after two years to ensure that the project is still in compliance with FHA's eligibility requirements and that no conditions currently exist which would present an unacceptable risk to FHA. For existing condominium projects seeking recertification, FHA will now only require applicants to submit documents reflecting any substantive changes since the project's prior approval.
Calculation of Owner-Occupancy
The procedure for calculating the required owner-occupancy percentage (50 percent) is modified to allow units that are not investor-owned to be considered owner-occupied for the purpose of Condominium Project approval. A condominium is considered to be owner-occupied provided they are not:
Tenant Occupied; Vacant and listed for rent; Existing (previously occupied), vacant and listed for sale; or Under contract to a purchaser who does not intend to occupy the unit as a Principal Residence or Secondary Residence. The term Principal Residence and Secondary Residence have the same meaning.
• Tenant Occupied;
• Vacant and listed for rent;
• Existing (previously occupied), vacant and listed for sale; or
• Under contract to a purchaser who does not intend to occupy the unit as a Principal Residence or Secondary Residence. The term Principal Residence and Secondary Residence have the same meaning.
Expansion of Eligible Condominium Project Insurance Coverage
Homeowners' Associations (HOAs) are required to maintain adequate ""master"" or ""blanket"" property insurance in an amount equal to 100% of current replacement cost of the condominium (exclusive of land, foundation, excavation and other items normally excluded from coverage). Insurance coverage for condominium project approval that consists of pooled policies for affiliated projects, state-run plans, or contains coinsurance obligations on the part of the policy holder is now permitted to satisfy this requirement."
11/16/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-146.cfm,FHA's 2015 Annual Report Shows Capital Reserves Now Exceed 2%,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today released its annual report to Congress on the financial condition of the Federal Housing Administration's Mutual Mortgage Insurance (MMI) Fund. The independent actuarial analysis shows the MMI Fund's capital ratio stands at 2.07 percent—the first time since 2008 that FHA's reserve ratio exceeded the congressionally required 2 percent threshold. The economic value of the MMI Fund gained $19 billion in Fiscal Year 2015, driven by strong actions to reduce risk, cut losses and improve recoveries.
This is the third consecutive year of economic growth for the MMI Fund, allowing FHA to expand credit access to qualified borrowers even as the broader housing market continues to recover. FHA's annual report also notes a significant increase in loan volume during FY 2015, due largely to a reduction in annual mortgage insurance premium prices announced in January. Read a comprehensive summary of the report released today.
""FHA is on solid financial footing and positioned to continue playing its vital role in assisting future generations of homeowners,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""We've taken a number of steps to strengthen the Fund and increase credit access to responsible borrowers. Today's report demonstrates that we struck the right balance in responsibly growing the Fund, reducing premiums, and doing what FHA was born to do - allowing hardworking Americans to become homeowners and spurring growth in the housing market as well as the broader economy.""
Major Findings of FHA's Annual Report
The MMI Fund's capital ratio is now above Congress' two percent requirement, a full year earlier than last year's projection. FHA's independent actuary reports the Fund's capital ratio is 2.07 percent, up from 0.41 percent in FY 2014.

FHA's decision in January to reduce annual mortgage insurance premiums (MIP) by a half a percent stimulated a 42 percent increase in total volume including a 27 percent hike in purchase-loan endorsements. The MIP reduction also allowed FHA to expand access to credit by serving 75,000 new borrowers with credit scores of 680 or below.

The economic health of the MMI Fund improved significantly in FY 2015 with a net value of nearly $24 billion, an increase of $19 billion over FY 2014. This gain in economic value is the largest one-year increase since FY 2012. In the past three consecutive fiscal years, the Fund's value increased by $40 billion. This improvement shows tremendous progress, especially considering that the Fund had a negative value of $16.3 billion in FY 2012.

The FHA's Role in the Housing Market
The FHA was established in response to the failure of the banking system during the Great Depression to help stabilize the economy and the housing market. When the private market couldn't or wouldn't provide access to credit, FHA was there, investing in our economy and preserving pathways to the middle class - just as it was designed to do. During this most recent crisis, FHA experienced a nearly five-fold increase in market share enabling it to provide critical access to credit when most needed. Today, the number of single-family loan endorsements has declined to pre-crisis levels. This decline indicates the housing market and economy are beginning to recover.
Since 1934, FHA helped approximately 40 million Americans purchase or refinance homes—nearly 7 million of those just during the most recent crisis."
11/17/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-147.cfm,HUD Reaches Agreement with Michigan Lender in Disability Discrimination Case,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced a Conciliation Agreement with Mortgage One, Inc., of Sterling Heights, Michigan, resolving allegations of lending discrimination against an applicant with disabilities. HUD claimed Mortgage One and loan officer Nancy Doody required the mortgage applicant to provide intrusive and unnecessary documentation regarding his disabilities before approving his FHA-insured mortgage. Read the agreement.
The Fair Housing Act makes it illegal to discriminate in the terms and conditions of a loan to an individual based on a disability, including imposing different application or qualification criteria.
""A person's qualifications to purchase a home should be the only criteria used to evaluate his or her loan application, not whether they are living with a disability,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""This agreement reaffirms HUD's ongoing commitment to ensuring that mortgage lenders treat all applicants fairly.""
The case came to HUD's attention when an applicant for a loan with Mortgage One filed a complaint alleging that the lender delayed his application because of his disabilities. Specifically, the man alleged that before closing on the loan, Mortgage One requested that he provide verification from his doctor that his disability is permanent and/or a letter from the Social Security Administration stating that he would remain on disability for at least three years.
Under the Conciliation Agreement HUD reached with Mortgage One, the lender will provide monetary relief to the man and notify its loan officers, underwriters, and processors that they may not discriminate against FHA borrowers who derive income from a public assistance program such as Social Security Disability Insurance by seeking personal medical information.
In addition, Doody, the loan processor who handled the man's application, will attend a Fair Housing Act course regarding the obligations of lenders and their loan officers to comply with federal fair housing laws.
Any person who believes he or she has experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed by going to www.hud.gov/fairhousing, or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, whichcan be accessed through Apple and Android devices."
11/18/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-148.cfm,HUD and Census Bureau Announce New Residential Construction Activity in October,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Census Bureau jointly announced the following new residential construction statistics for October 2015:
BUILDING PERMITS

New Residential Construction data for November 2015 will be released on Wednesday, December 16, 2015, at 8:30 A.M. EST.
EXPLANATORY NOTES
In interpreting changes in the statistics in this release, note that month-to-month changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show movements which may be irregular. It may take two months to establish an underlying trend for building permit authorizations, 4 months for total starts, and six months for total completions. The statistics in this release are estimated from sample surveys and are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated relative standard errors of the most recent data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2%) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90-percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimates of total building permits, housing starts and housing completions are revised about three percent or less. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found on our web site listed above.
* 90% confidence interval includes zero. The Census Bureau does not have sufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero.

11/19/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-149.cfm,HUD Reports Homelessness Continues to Decline Nationally,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Julián Castro today announced HUD's latest national one-night estimate of homelessness, highlighting a continuing decline across the nation. The results are based on HUD's 'point-in-time' estimates, which seek to measure the scope of homelessness on a single night in January each year.
HUD's 2015 Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress (https://www.hudexchange.info/resource/4832/2015-ahar-part-1-pit-estimates-of-homelessness/) found that there has been an overall 11 percent decrease and 26 percent drop in the unsheltered homeless population since 2010, when President Obama launched Opening Doors (http://usich.gov/opening_doors/), the nation's first-ever comprehensive strategy to prevent and end homelessness. Between 2010 and January 2015, veteran homelessness declined 36 percent, family homelessness declined 19 percent, and chronic homelessness declined 22 percent. The report shows that certain communities are making significant positive progress, while others are struggling in light of the widespread housing affordability crisis, budget shortages, or slow adoption of best practices.
In remarks last week at a Veterans Day ceremony in Richmond, Va., Secretary Castro congratulated the Commonwealth for becoming the first state to effectively end veteran homelessness, as well as other communities across the nation from Syracuse, New York to Las Vegas, Nevada. The decline in veteran homelessness is largely attributed to significant investments made by the U.S. Congress and the close collaboration between HUD and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs on a joint program called HUD-VA Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH), which provides a rental subsidy along with support services for those veterans who need them. Since 2008, nearly 80,000 rental vouchers have been awarded and more than 101,000 veterans have been served through the program. Last week, HUD and VA announced an additional $12 million to expand the program.
""The Obama Administration has made an historic commitment to effectively end homelessness in this nation. Together with our partners across the federal government and communities from coast to coast, we have made tremendous progress toward our ambitious goals. But our work is far from finished. We have to continue making smart investments in the strategies that work so that everyone has a place to call home,"" said HUD Secretary Castro.
""While we are seeing strong progress in some communities, we also know that we need to accelerate progress in others,"" says Matthew Doherty, Executive Director of the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness. ""While communities work hard to use their current resources as efficiently as they can and to implement Housing First practices, we are working to provide the additional Federal investments, included in the President's FY 2016 budget, that are needed to drive greater progress toward ending homelessness for all Americans.""
""While we see progress, we have more work ahead so long as there are Veterans who have served our nation without a home,"" said Secretary of Veterans Affairs Robert A. McDonald. ""VA is serving more Veterans than ever before with wrap-around heath care, education and job training services that provide the Veteran with the tools they need to stay out of homelessness. We will solve this challenge community by community. Already we have seen mayors, governors, business leaders and nonprofit partners step up across this nation and join our effort to prevent Veterans from having to live on our streets. We will continue to rely on our government and non-government partners as we make sure communities have the tools in place to rescue Veterans from homelessness and keep Veterans from sliding back into homelessness.""
Since the passage of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act in 1987, HUD has worked with communities to build the capacity of homeless programs across the country. By targeting investments to individuals and families who need assistance most - those on the street the longest, or with the greatest barriers to housing - HUD is ensuring that its limited resources are used as effectively and efficiently as possible. Despite increased requests in the President's Budget each year, HUD homeless assistance funding from Congress has not kept pace with need. This has resulted in only a small decrease in the number of persons experiencing chronic homelessness between 2014 and 2015. In the meantime, HUD continues to incentivize communities to target resources, prioritize assistance, and invest in programs with proven track records.
The data being reported by HUD today on youth experiencing homelessness is a work in progress because communities are still learning how to collect this data accurately. Because of this, HUD cautions its partners and stakeholders from drawing conclusions regarding the state of youth homelessness based solely on this data. In order to continue to improve data on youth, HUD revised its data collection requirements, which may result in future increased point-in-time counts as communities improve their methodologies.
HUD is also working with communities to improve collection to better understand the size and scope of homelessness, including efforts like youth engagement and collaboration with schools and other youth-serving systems. In addition, HUD is in the process of improving and updating its year-long data collection on youth, and now also includes data from the U.S. Department of Education and American Housing Survey in its Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress.
Improved data collection informs HUD's strategies for ending homelessness. Across the nation, communities are implementing systems to quickly and effectively house individuals and families experiencing homelessness in a coordinated way. They are working together across agencies, creating unprecedented partnerships toward achieving the national goal of ending homelessness.
Key Findings
On a single night in January 2015, state and local planning agencies reported the following estimates of homelessness:
Overall, homelessness has declined by more than 72,000 people since 2010, an 11 percent reduction since the release of Opening Doors. In January 2015, an estimated 564,708 people were homeless on a given night. Most (69 percent) were staying in residential programs for homeless people, and 31 percent were found in unsheltered locations. Veteran homelessness fell by 36 percent between 2010 and January 2015, including a 47 percent decline in unsheltered veterans. On a single night in January 2015, fewer than 48,000 veterans were homeless, and only 34 percent of those were on the street. HUD expects this trend to continue. Chronic homelessness among individuals continued to decline. Since 2010, chronic homelessness has declined 22 percent. More than 83,000 individuals experiencing homelessness in January 2015 were reported as chronically homeless. There was a five percent reduction in families experiencing homelessness between the 2014 and January 2015. Between 2010 and January 2015, family homelessness declined by 19 percent. In January 2015, the estimated number of unaccompanied homeless youth and children was 36,097.

Background:
Every year in late January, volunteers across the nation conduct a count of their local sheltered and unsheltered homeless populations. These one-night 'snapshot' counts are then reported to HUD. This data is crucial in understanding the scope of homelessness and measuring progress in reducing it. The point-in-time count only captures those persons sleeping in sheltered and unsheltered locations on the night of the count but is not reflective of who is eligible for HUD's homeless assistance grants programs."
11/20/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-150.cfm,HUD Proposes Rule Ensuring Equal Access to Housing and Services in Accordance with Gender Identity,"WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced its proposed ""Equal Access in Accordance with an Individual's Gender Identity in Community Planning and Development Programs Rule (Gender Identity Rule)."" The proposed Gender Identity Rule was created after reviewing and monitoring the implementation of HUD's Equal Access to Housing in HUD Programs Regardless of Sexual Orientation or Gender Identity Rule (Equal Access Rule), which was published in 2012. The Equal Access Rule ensures that housing assisted or insured by HUD is open to all eligible individuals and families without regard to actual or perceived sexual orientation, gender identity or marital status.
""A person seeking shelter is already in a very vulnerable situation, and they deserve to be treated with dignity when they request our assistance,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""This rule takes us one step closer to full acceptance of transgender men and women, and will ensure they receive the proper services that respect their identity.""
Based on its evaluation of the Equal Access rule and consultation with LGBT stakeholders, HUD's proposed Gender Identity Rule would require recipients and sub-recipients of assistance from HUD's Office of Community Planning and Development (CPD), as well as owners, operators, and managers of shelters, buildings, and facilities with shared sleeping quarters or shared bathing facilities to provide transgender persons and other persons who do not identify with the sex they were assigned at birth with access to programs, benefits, services, and accommodations in accordance with their gender identity.
HUD's 2012 Equal Access Rule provided a limited exception for inquiries about the sex of an individual to determine eligibility for housing provided or to be provided to an individual when the housing is a temporary, emergency shelter that involves the sharing of sleeping areas or bathrooms, or inquiries made for the purpose of determining the number of bedrooms to which a household may be entitled. Upon HUD's review of that policy, the proposed Gender Identity Rule would eliminate the Equal Access Rule's current prohibition on inquiries related to sexual orientation or gender identity, while maintaining the prohibition against discrimination on those bases.
For more information about the proposed Gender Identity Rule, please visit www.hud.gov/lgbt
This proposed rule will be open for public comment for the next 60 days.

Comments may also be submitted by mail to the Regulations Divisions, Office of General Counsel, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 7th Street SW, Room 10276, Washington, DC 20410.
Since 2010, HUD has taken significant steps to strengthen protections for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) individuals and their families, such as adopting the principle that sex stereotyping and gender nonconformity is sex discrimination under the Fair Housing Act, adopting the requirement that applicants for competitive HUD funds must be in compliance with state and local LGBT nondiscrimination laws, releasing a groundbreaking study on same-sex housing discrimination, and pursuing complaints under the Equal Access Rule."
11/23/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-152.cfm,HUD Offers Next Round of Planning Grants to Help Transform Communities,"WASHINGTON - Today, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced the availability of new funding to help local communities across the country to redevelop severely distressed public and HUD-assisted housing and transform surrounding neighborhoods. The funding announcement introduces an additional, innovative component to the Choice Neighborhoods Planning Grant, called Planning and Action Grants.
Grants of up to $2 million will enable communities to create a locally driven plan to transform struggling neighborhoods, as well as implement early improvements, such as reclaiming vacant property and attracting new businesses. Read HUD's funding notice (http://www.grants.gov/view-opportunity.html?oppId=280203).
""HUD's mission of expanding opportunity extends beyond a family's front door to the neighborhoods where they live,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""These grants will let local leaders create homegrown plans to strengthen their neighborhoods and to take those first vital steps to turn their plans into reality.""
Choice Neighborhoods is HUD's signature place-based initiative in support of the President's goal to build Ladders of Opportunity to the middle class. Choice Neighborhoods is focused on three core goals:
Housing: Replace distressed public and assisted housing with high-quality mixed-income housing that is well-managed and responsive to the needs of the surrounding neighborhood. People: Improve educational outcomes and intergenerational mobility for youth with services and supports delivered directly to youth and their families. Neighborhood: Create the conditions necessary for public and private reinvestment in distressed neighborhoods to offer the kinds of amenities and assets, including safety, good schools, and commercial activity, that are important to families' choices about their community.
• Housing: Replace distressed public and assisted housing with high-quality mixed-income housing that is well-managed and responsive to the needs of the surrounding neighborhood.
• People: Improve educational outcomes and intergenerational mobility for youth with services and supports delivered directly to youth and their families.
• Neighborhood: Create the conditions necessary for public and private reinvestment in distressed neighborhoods to offer the kinds of amenities and assets, including safety, good schools, and commercial activity, that are important to families' choices about their community.
Up to now, Choice Neighborhoods Planning Grant funds could only be used to create a neighborhood Transformation Plan. However, experience with the 63 previously awarded Choice Neighborhoods Planning Grantees has shown that tangible, early actions help sustain community energy, attract new resources, and build momentum to turn that plan into reality.
HUD's FY15/16 Choice Neighborhoods Planning Grant funds build upon these lessons by introducing Planning and Action Grants. Under these grants, communities with severely distressed public or HUD-assisted housing will continue to develop a successful neighborhood transformation plan and build the support necessary for that plan to be successfully implemented. In addition, Planning and Action Grant funds will also enable activities including:
Reclaiming and recycling vacant property into community gardens, pocket parks, farmers markets, or land banking;
• Reclaiming and recycling vacant property into community gardens, pocket parks, farmers markets, or land banking;
Beautification, place making, and community arts projects;
• Beautification, place making, and community arts projects;
Homeowner and business façade improvement programs;
• Homeowner and business façade improvement programs;
Neighborhood broadband/Wi-Fi;
• Neighborhood broadband/Wi-Fi;
Fresh food initiatives; and
• Fresh food initiatives; and
Gap financing for economic development projects.
• Gap financing for economic development projects.
Through the Choice Neighborhoods planning process local governments, housing authorities, residents, nonprofits, tribal authorities, private developers, school districts, police departments, and other civic organizations create a common vision and develop effective strategies to revitalize their neighborhood. The resulting Transformation Plan and locally driven Action Activities lay the foundation for revitalizing the distressed public and/or assisted housing units, transforming the surrounding neighborhood, and promoting opportunities for families.
Today, Choice Neighborhoods Planning Grantees can be found across the country in cities and towns, such as Kansas City, Missouri, Norwalk, Connecticut, and Sacramento, California. Several Planning Grantees have already launched neighborhood improvements that provided the inspiration for Planning and Action Grants. For example, in Salisbury, North Carolina, partners expanded a Mobile Fresh Farm to residents, spurring a nearby college to open a new culinary school that will provide mentoring to local students and sell surplus produce at discount prices. In Columbus, Ohio, partners created a gateway to the community by redeveloping a highway bridge and creating a mural wall with a history of the neighborhood.
Choice Neighborhoods Planning Grant funds are available for public housing authorities, local governments, nonprofit organizations, and tribal entities. Applicants must submit a completed electronic application through www.grants.gov by February 9, 2016."
11/24/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-151.cfm,U.S. Announces Settlement with Illinois Landlord for Failing to Disclose Potentially Dangerous Lead Hazards,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) today announced a settlement with a Rockford, Illinois landlord to resolve a claim he failed to inform tenants, some with young children, that their homes may contain potentially dangerous lead.
The agreement requires Dennis Hardesty to replace windows and clean up lead‑based paint hazards in 50 rental properties containing a total of 52 units (see attached list of properties). In addition to the $308,000 worth of lead abatement work, Hardesty agreed to pay $5,000 in penalties.
According to the federal government,Hardesty violated the Federal Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act (Residential Lead Act) by failing to inform tenants that their homes may contain potentially dangerous levels of lead. Winnebago County health department officials identified at least seven children with elevated blood lead levels in the properties Hardesty leased. Investigations by the health department identified lead‑based paint and lead-based paint hazards in the units. Going forward, Hardesty will ensure that he will provide information about lead‑based paint to tenants before they are obligated to sign any lease.
The lead abatement work Hardesty will perform as a result of the settlementincludes window replacement and abatement of all friction and impact surfaces, and clearance exams to make those units lead safe for families to rent and live in. HUD will provide ongoing monitoring of Hardesty's implementation of the settlement agreement, and will share the results with its federal partners for possible further action.
""Lead poisoning is entirely preventable but it requires all of us to recognize that we share a responsibility to protect our vulnerable populations, especially young children who are still developing,"" said Matt Ammon, Director of HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes. ""Landlords of homes built before 1978 have a legal responsibility to make their tenants aware of lead-based paint and lead-based paint hazards they know about or that may be in their homes so that tenants can protect their families.""
""This settlement will protect children in Rockford from exposure to lead-based paint - and it sends a clear message to landlords and property managers across the country that the Environmental Protection Agency is prioritizing enforcement actions to eliminate elevated blood lead levels in children,"" EPA Region 5 Administrator Susan Hedman said.
""This settlement requires Dennis Hardesty to institute a robust program to ensure that his properties are compliant with federal law,"" said Zachary T. Fardon, United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois. ""My office will continue to enforce these important laws to protect tenants from exposure to dangerous lead paint.""
The settlement announced today represents the first joint Residential Lead Act enforcement action in Rockford. It was the result of intensive coordination among local health officials and federal investigators. HUD, EPA and the Department of Justice are continuing similar enforcement efforts around the nation. As a result of enforcement actions taken thus far, landlords have agreed to conduct lead-based paint hazard reduction in more than 187,000 apartments and to pay $1.5 million in civil penalties. In resolving these cases, landlords have committed to expend more than an estimated $31 million to address lead-based paint hazards in the affected units. In addition, over $700,000 has been provided by defendants to community-based projects to reduce lead poisoning.
Background
The Residential Lead Act is one of the primary federal enforcement tools to prevent lead poisoning in young children. The Lead Disclosure Rule requires home sellers and landlords of housing built before 1978 to disclose to purchasers and potential tenants knowledge of lead-based paint or lead-based paint hazards using a disclosure form, signed by both parties, attached to the sales contract or lease containing the required lead warning statement, provide any available records or reports, and provide an EPA-approved ""Protect Your Family From Lead in Your Home"" information pamphlet. Sellers must also provide purchasers with an opportunity to conduct a lead-based paint inspection and/or risk assessment at the purchaser's expense. Acceptable lead disclosure forms can be found at www.hud.gov/offices/lead/dislcosurerule and www.epa.gov/lead/pubs/leadbase.htm.
Health Effects of Lead-Based Paint
No safe blood lead level in children has been identified. Lead exposure can affect nearly every system in the body. Lead exposure causes reduced IQ, learning disabilities, developmental delays, reduced height, poorer hearing, and a host of other health problems in young children. Many of these effects are thought to be irreversible. In later years, lead-poisoned children are much more likely to drop out of school, become juvenile delinquents and engage in criminal and other anti-social behavior. Researchers have found that even at low levels, lead exposure in children can significantly impact IQ and might delay puberty in young girls.
At higher levels, lead can damage a child's kidneys and central nervous system and cause anemia, coma, convulsions and even death. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 4 million households have children living in them that are being exposed to high levels of lead. There are approximately half a million U.S. children ages 1-5 with blood lead levels above 5 micrograms per deciliter, the reference level at which CDC recommends public health actions be initiated.
Eliminating lead-based paint hazards in older low-income housing is essential if childhood lead poisoning is to be eradicated. According to CDC estimates, the percentage of children with elevated blood lead levels has been cut in half since the early 1990's, although as many as 1 million children are still affected by lead poisoning today. HUD estimates that the number of houses with lead paint has declined from 64 million in 1990 to 37 million in 2006. About 23 million homes still have significant lead-based paint hazards, and about 3.6 million homes with children less than 6 years of age have one or more of these hazards."
11/25/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-153.cfm,HUD and Census Bureau Report New Residential Sales in October,"WASHINGTON - Sales of new single-family houses in October 2015 were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 495,000, according to estimates released jointly today by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Census Bureau. This is 10.7 percent (±17.7%)* above the revised September rate of 447,000 and is 4.9 percent (±17.6%) above the October 2014 estimate of 472,000.
The median sales price of new houses sold in October 2015 was $281,500; the average sales price was $366,000. The seasonally adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of September was 225,000. This represents a supply of 5.5 months at the current sales rate.
Estimates of houses sold and for sale by stage of construction are now available on a seasonally adjusted basis as well as not seasonally adjusted basis. Historic seasonally adjusted data will be available back to January 1999 at http://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/historical_data/.
New Residential Sales data for November 2015 will be released on Wednesday, December 23, 2015, at 10:00 A.M. EST. Read more about today's release of new home sales (www.census.gov/newhomesales).
EXPLANATORY NOTES
These statistics are estimated from sample surveys. They are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated average relative standard errors of the preliminary data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2%) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90-percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. Changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show irregular movement. It takes 3 months to establish a trend for new houses sold. Preliminary new home sales figures are subject to revision due to the survey methodology and definitions used. The survey is primarily based on a sample of houses selected from building permits. Since a ""sale"" is defined as a deposit taken or sales agreement signed, this can occur prior to a permit being issued. An estimate of these prior sales is included in the sales figure. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimate of total sales is revised about 4 percent. Changes in sales price data reflect changes in the distribution of houses by region, size, etc., as well as changes in the prices of houses with identical characteristics. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found on our web site listed above.
* 90% confidence interval includes zero. The Census Bureau does not have sufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero."
12/08/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-155.cfm,"Common Sense Media, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Announce New National Commitment to Benefit HUD's Connecthome Initiative","SAN FRANCISCO, CA - U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Julián Castro and Common Sense CEO James P. Steyer announced today that Common Sense has become a national participant in HUD's ConnectHome (http://connecthome.hud.gov/) initiative, a public-private collaboration to connect families living in HUD-assisted housing to affordable high-speed Internet.
Under the new commitment to ConnectHome, Common Sense (https://www.commonsensemedia.org/about-us/our-mission) will make available through on-the-ground training and online webinars a suite of its high quality digital citizenship resources, including Connecting Families (https://www.commonsensemedia.org/educators/connecting-families), Digital Compass (https://www.commonsensemedia.org/educators/digital-compass) and Digital Passport (https://www.commonsensemedia.org/educators/digital-passport). Common Sense is a recognized national leader in digital literacy and other media and technology issues affecting children, teachers and parents. Common Sense digital literacy and citizenship materials are used in more than 100,000 schools by more than 300,000 teachers.
The announcement comes on the same day that Secretary Castro visited Common Sense's headquarters in San Francisco to discuss the initiative with staff Common Sense Kids Action (https://www.commonsensemedia.org/kids-action), Common Sense Education (https://www.commonsensemedia.org/educators), and CEO Steyer.
In July, President Obama and Secretary Castro announced ConnectHome as one of several federal efforts designed to reduce digital inequality in schools and homes across the country. ConnectHome, led in the private sector by national non-profit EveryoneOn (http://everyoneon.org/connecthome/), offers broadband access, technical training, digital literacy programs, and devices for residents in HUD-assisted housing in 28 communities across the nation.
""Through ConnectHome, we are able to provide more Americans with the opportunity to remain competitive with communities across the globe,"" said Secretary Castro. ""Common Sense's new commitment of digital content benefits the entire family - empowering kids to think critically and giving parents the peace of mind to know that their children are safely participating in the digital world.""
""Kids begin their day learning in the classroom, but their education continues at home, which is why it is so important for every family to have broadband access,"" said Steyer. ""We are proud to participate with EveryoneOn and HUD's ConnectHome initiative to provide families with the information they need to help their kids take advantage of all that technology has to offer while helping them make safe and smart decisions along the way.""
While most Americans take high-speed Internet for granted, more than 5 million households with school-aged children in the U.S. do not have it. And research shows that lower-income and minority communities have lower broadband adoption rates than the population at large. But expanding access to broadband has also been shown to boost educational, economic and health outcomes (https://d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/uploads/kids_action/benefits_of_broadband_expansion_to_americas_economy_education_and_health-cska-2015.pdf), making ConnectHome and other efforts to reduce the 'homework gap' and digital inequality vitally important steps toward boosting educational achievement and reducing income inequality in America.
EveryoneOn CEO Zach Leverez welcomed Common Sense's role in ConnectHome. ""Low-income families are increasingly being left behind in the digital world because they can't yet afford what we consider a basic right: high-speed home Internet access. Thanks to ConnectHome, hundreds of thousands of families will now be able to afford access to the Internet at home, providing all kids with the same opportunities, even when not at school. Common Sense's commitment to providing customized training, resources, and free digital learning content to HUD-assisted residents is key to realizing the ConnectHome vision for solutions that empower families not only with the technology, but also the skills and resources required to be successful.""
Common Sense will provide for free its high-quality digital citizenship content for families and children, in-person in select communities and online to all 28 ConnectHome communities. The content is available in English and Spanish, and includes an array of resources, including videos, tipsheets, case studies, facilitator guides, and video games that support and empower adults and children to think critically, participate responsibly, and behave ethically in their online lives.
In addition to ConnectHome, Common Sense advocated for and is now working to finish the job of ensuring access to high-speed Internet in every classroom and library (https://www.commonsensemedia.org/kids-action/issues/education-and-technology/e-rate-toolkit) under the Federal Communication Commission's newly modernized E-Rate program. And Common Sense strongly supports the FCC's plan to modernize the 40-year-old Lifeline (https://www.commonsensemedia.org/kids-action/issues/poverty-and-social-mobility) low-income telephone service program to include broadband.
""Common Sense believes that high-speed Internet today is a necessity, not a luxury, and that every child deserves equal access to technology no matter their zip-code or family income,"" Steyer said.
About Common Sense: With more than 300,000 teacher members in nearly 100,000 schools and millions of parent users at home, Common Sense rates, educates and advocates on behalf of parents, teachers and kids to help them navigate in a world of media and technology and to ensure all children have the opportunity to thrive in the 21st Century. Common Sense's education division provides teachers and schools with free research-based classroom tools to help students harness technology for learning and life. And its K-12 Digital Citizenship Curriculum (https://www.commonsensemedia.org/educators) teaches students how to make safe, smart, and ethical decisions in the digital world.

12/09/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-156.cfm,FHA Announces New Loan Limits to Take Effect January 1st,"WASHINGTON - The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) today announced the agency's new schedule of loan limits for 2016. These loan limits are effective for case numbers assigned on or after January 1, 2016, and will remain in effect through the end of the year. Read FHA's mortgagee letters (for forward and reverse mortgage programs) on HUD's website.
Due to changes in housing prices, the maximum loan limits for forward mortgages increased in 188 counties. There were no areas with a decrease in the maximum loan limits for forward mortgages.
Each year, FHA recalculates its loan limits based on 115 % of the median house price in the area. For counties, or equivalent, located in Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) the limit for all areas in the MSA is calculated based on the highest cost county.
There is no change to the FHA national loan limit ""ceiling"" which remains at $625,500 and the ""floor"" which remains at $271,050. FHA's minimum national loan limit ""floor"" is set at 65 percent of the national conforming loan limit of $417,000. The floor applies to those areas where 115 percent of the median home price is less than 65 percent of the national conforming loan limit.
Any area where the loan limit exceeds the ""floor"" is considered a high cost area. The maximum FHA loan limit ""ceiling"" for high cost areas is 150 percent of the national conforming limit.
Additional information and loan limit adjustments for two-, three-, and four-unit properties, and in Special Exception Areas, are noted in FHA's mortgagee letter. An attachment to the Mortgagee Letter provides information on which counties are eligible for loan limits above the national standard. Borrowers with existing FHA insured mortgages may continue to utilize FHA's Streamline refinance program regardless of their loan balance.
The mortgage loan limits for FHA-insured reverse mortgages will also remain unchanged. The FHA reverse-mortgage product, known as the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM), will continue to have a maximum claim amount of $625,500, with actual limits based on property value, borrower age, and current interest rates. Reverse mortgages allow homeowners age 62 and older to age in place by borrowing against the value of their homes without any requirements for monthly payments; no repayment is required as long as a homeowner lives in the home. The reverse mortgage is repaid, with interest, when the homeowner leaves the home.

12/10/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-157.cfm,HUD Finds Homelessness Prevention Demonstration Increased Housing and Employment for Veterans,"WASHINGTON - In 2009, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) embarked upon a demonstration to explore ways to prevent or end homelessness among veterans. Today, HUD released the Veterans Homelessness Prevention Demonstration (VHPD) Evaluation Final Report (http://www.huduser.gov/portal/publications/homeless/veterans-homelessness-prevention-report.html), which finds participating veterans, many having served in Iraq and Afghanistan, experienced substantial improvements in housing stability, employment and income that persisted after exiting the demonstration.
Conducted by Silber & Associates and the Urban Institute, the evaluation of the Veterans Homelessness Prevention Demonstration found that six months after leaving the demonstration program, 76 percent of those veterans studied lived in their own place, employment nearly doubled, and monthly incomes grew by 41 percent. View Homeless on the Home Front (http://apps.urban.org/features/homeless-veterans/), a photo essay profiling the work to prevent and end veteran homelessness.
""When our men and women of the armed forces return home to civilian life, some after multiple deployments, they need and deserve housing and jobs,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""This study shows us that our collaboration across federal agencies is working. By providing a roof and a place to call home, we're creating the stability needed to find employment and transition back into civilian life.""
""Prevention is critical to ending homelessness among veterans but it's also the hardest part,"" said Mary Cunningham, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute and lead author of the report. ""Demonstration projects are pilots that are designed to explore a new approach, such as an intervention or a new form of support. VHPD was small in scale—with only five pilot sites—and there was no control group against which to compare results. Still, the promising nature of these early findings suggests that these new approaches are worth further testing.""
VHPD was the first homelessness prevention effort combining housing, health care, and employment services to serve homeless and at-risk veterans and their families. This demonstration provided short- to medium-term housing assistance (up to 18 months), including security deposits, rent, rental arrearages (up to 6 months back rent), moving cost assistance, and utilities; case management; and referrals to community-based services and supports. Service providers could also use VHPD funds for child care, credit repair, and transportation expenses.
In addition to these supports, VHPD connected veterans to needed health services through the VA's health care system and employment services through local workforce agencies, so the demonstration could provide veterans with a comprehensive set of supports and prepare them to sustain housing on their own.
HUD, in consultation with VA and DOL, selected five military bases and their surrounding communities to participate in VHPD:
• Camp Pendleton in San Diego, California;
• Fort Hood in Killeen, Texas;
• Fort Drum in Watertown, New York;
• Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Tacoma, Washington; and
• MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida.
HUD allocated $10 million in demonstration funds ($2 million for each site); VA awarded $5 million to provide case management and outreach services; and DOL provided services through its existing veteran employment programs. The three-year trial operated from 2011 to 2014, during which time the demonstration served 4,824 adults and children, including 2,023 veterans in 1,976 households.
The evaluation found that providers successfully reached post-September 11th-era veterans, with 55 percent of clients in the study having served during this time period. Many of the households served were families: about 43 percent had children in their household and 27 percent were women. At the same time, many VHPD veterans suffered from poor health, serious mental illness, and/or disabilities that prevented them from working. Nevertheless, the study found the following positive outcomes:
26 percent of veterans who entered the demonstration were homeless and about 74 percent were at risk of homelessness. When they exited, 85 percent were stably housed. Six months after exiting, 76 percent of clients were in their own place, 18 percent lived with someone else, and 6 percent were homeless; another 4 percent were housed at follow-up but reported they had been homeless at some point since entering the program. Only 25 percent of VHPD clients were employed at entry compared to 43 percent at the follow-up interview 6 months after leaving VHPD. Average monthly income increased from $1,076 at entry to $1,519 at the follow-up interview.
• 26 percent of veterans who entered the demonstration were homeless and about 74 percent were at risk of homelessness. When they exited, 85 percent were stably housed.
• Six months after exiting, 76 percent of clients were in their own place, 18 percent lived with someone else, and 6 percent were homeless; another 4 percent were housed at follow-up but reported they had been homeless at some point since entering the program.

• Average monthly income increased from $1,076 at entry to $1,519 at the follow-up interview.
Among the lessons learned from this demonstration is that intense and targeted outreach is necessary; veteran-on-veteran supports are critical; service providers must have skills for working with clients suffering from traumatic brain injuries and post-traumatic stress disorders; and employment service providers must know how to translate military experience into terms that are meaningful in civilian labor markets."
12/16/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-158.cfm,HUD and Census Bureau Announce New Residential Construction Activity in November,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Census Bureau jointly announced the following new residential construction statistics for November 2015:

12/17/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-159.cfm,HUD Awards $100 Million to Help Public Housing Residents Secure Higher Paying Jobs and Become Self-Sufficient,"WASHINGTON - In an effort to help low-income residents find higher-paying jobs and become self-sufficient, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced a combined nearly $100 million investment through HUD's Jobs Plus Pilot Program and Family Self-Sufficiency (FSS) Program. Together, these programs support local public housing authorities and their partners to help residents increase earned income and financial literacy, reduce or eliminate the need for welfare assistance, and make progress toward economic independence and self-sufficiency.
HUD's Jobs Plus Pilot Program supports work readiness and connects public housing residents with employment, education and financial empowerment services-and it's a model proven to help public housing residents find and keep jobs. HUD's FSS Program promotes the development of local strategies to connect Housing Choice Voucher recipients and families living in public housing with public and private resources to increase earned income and financial literacy.

• Read more about the $75 million awarded grants under FSS Program
""These grants will make a meaningful impact in the lives of public housing residents and their families by providing a pathway towards self-sufficiency,"" said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. ""As the Department of Opportunity, HUD is empowering public housing residents to improve their circumstances with new economic and educational tools they need to compete and succeed in the workplace.""
HUD's Jobs-Plus Pilot Program support public housing authorities with tools they need to connect their residents with employment and training services to improve their economic circumstances. The Jobs Plus Pilot Program capitalizes on a successful demonstration (www.mdrc.org/publication/jobs-plus-promising-strategy) program that combines traditional employment, training and job placement services with a rent incentive and a place-based investment in building community support for work. The program model, which requires PHAs to partner with Department of Labor American Jobs Centers, promotes initiatives to improve employment and earnings outcomes, a critical element of self-sufficiency for all families. Targeting an entire development helps residents support each other through the process.
Recently, the non-profit organization MDRC released a report focused on the impacts of Jobs Plus among public housing residents. MDRC's analysis (www.mdrc.org/sites/default/files/policybrief_33.pdf) sought to test whether a program that combined employment and training services, new rent rules to ""make work pay,"" and neighbor-to-neighbor outreach centering on work could make a difference in the economic prospects of public housing residents. The study found that public housing residents who participated in Jobs Plus saw a 16 percent increase in earned income and that these earnings remained higher seven years after exiting the program.
The FSS Program help PHAs to hire service coordinators who work directly with residents to connect them with programs and services that already exist in the local community. Service coordinators also build relationships with the network of local service providers so as to more effectively serve the residents. The program encourages innovative strategies that link public housing and Housing Choice Voucher assistance with other resources to enable participating families to find jobs, increase earned income, reduce or eliminate the need for rental and/or welfare assistance, and make progress toward achieving economic independence and self-sufficiency."

12/21/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-160.cfm,HUD Reaches Agreement with Massachusetts Real Estate Company Accused of Discriminating Against Families with Children,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced today that it has approved two Conciliation Agreements with Delap Realty, LLC, of Northampton, Massachusetts, resolving allegations that the company and its agents violated the Fair Housing Act by discouraging families with children from renting over concerns the units might contain lead-based paint hazards.
The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to deny or limit housing because a family has children under the age of 18 and to make statements that discriminate against families with children. Housing may exclude children only if it meets the Fair Housing Act's exemption for housing for older persons.
""Families with children have a right to the same housing choices as other families,"" said Gustavo Velasquez, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. ""We are pleased that these agreements will help more families to be informed about the Fair Housing Act and their right to live in a healthy home.""
The settlement agreements are the result of complaints filed with the Department by the Housing Discrimination Project, Inc., a HUD Fair Housing Initiatives Program agency, alleging that when prospective renters responded to online ads placed by Delap, its agents discouraged families with children from applying. Read the two agreements: Agreement 1, Agreement 2.
Under the agreements, Delap and the other respondents will pay $9,500 to Housing Discrimination Project (HDP) and to develop a public service campaign on three English and Spanish language radio stations in coordination with HDP. Delap Realty also agreed to fund a three-week series of newspaper announcements in two local newspapers, including a Spanish language newspaper, highlighting the fact that refusing to rent to families with children because of the possible presence of lead paint is an act of discrimination that violates the Fair Housing Act.
In addition, Delap Realty agreed to include language in its contracts with property owners stating that the owners must comply with the Massachusetts Lead Poisoning Prevention and Control Act. All future advertisements for any rental property owned or advertised by Delap and the other respondents will state:
This property complies with all fair housing laws, including the Massachusetts Lead Poisoning Prevention and Control Act, which prohibits discrimination against families with children due to the presence of lead paint and requires landlords to remove all paint hazards before renting to any family with a child under the age of six (6).
Persons who believe they have experienced discrimination may file a complaint by contacting HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at (800) 669-9777 (voice) or (800) 927-9275 (TTY). Housing discrimination complaints may also be filed at www.hud.gov/fairhousing or by downloading HUD's free housing discrimination mobile application, which can be accessed through Apple and Android devices."
12/23/2015:,https://archives.hud.gov//news/2015/pr15-162.cfm,HUD and Census Bureau Report New Residential Sales in November,"WASHINGTON - Sales of new single-family houses in November 2015 were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 490,000, according to estimates released jointly today by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Census Bureau. This is 4.3 percent (±11.9%)* above the revised October rate of 470,000 and is 9.1 percent (±20.9%)* above the November 2014 estimate of 449,000.
The median sales price of new houses sold in November 2015 was $305,000; the average sales price was $374,900. The seasonally adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of November was 232,000. This represents a supply of 5.7 months at the current sales rate.
Estimates of houses sold and for sale by stage of construction are now available on a seasonally adjusted basis as well as not seasonally adjusted basis. Historic seasonally adjusted data will be available back to January 1999 at http://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/historical_data/.
New Residential Sales data for December 2015 will be released on Wednesday, January 27, 2016, at 10:00 A.M. EST. Read more about today's release of new home sales (www.census.gov/newhomesales).
EXPLANATORY NOTES
These statistics are estimated from sample surveys. They are subject to sampling variability as well as nonsampling error including bias and variance from response, nonreporting, and undercoverage. Estimated average relative standard errors of the preliminary data are shown in the tables. Whenever a statement such as ""2.5 percent (±3.2%) above"" appears in the text, this indicates the range (-0.7 to +5.7 percent) in which the actual percent change is likely to have occurred. All ranges given for percent changes are 90-percent confidence intervals and account only for sampling variability. If a range does not contain zero, the change is statistically significant. If it does contain zero, the change is not statistically significant; that is, it is uncertain whether there was an increase or decrease. The same policies apply to the confidence intervals for percent changes shown in the tables. Changes in seasonally adjusted statistics often show irregular movement. It takes 3 months to establish a trend for new houses sold. Preliminary new home sales figures are subject to revision due to the survey methodology and definitions used. The survey is primarily based on a sample of houses selected from building permits. Since a ""sale"" is defined as a deposit taken or sales agreement signed, this can occur prior to a permit being issued. An estimate of these prior sales is included in the sales figure. On average, the preliminary seasonally adjusted estimate of total sales is revised about 4 percent. Changes in sales price data reflect changes in the distribution of houses by region, size, etc., as well as changes in the prices of houses with identical characteristics. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found on our web site listed above.
* 90% confidence interval includes zero. The Census Bureau does not have sufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero."
